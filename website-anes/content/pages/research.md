Anesthesiological care encompasses comprehensive care for patients in the pre-hospital and perioperative phases, as well as (ambulatory) pain management. The focus is on safety, pain management, and maintaining physiological stability. The field integrates knowledge of anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, and psychology for the administration and management of anesthetics and other medications, addressing both acute and chronic pain.

Currently, the Department of Anesthesiology at the UMCG has appointed 5 professors in the areas of pharmacology, neuroscience, hemodynamics and monitoring, pain, and educational innovation.

To further increase our impact in the region and the scientific field, and to fully utilize our broad expertise, these strong substantive lines will be firmly anchored in a research agenda that aligns with societal and professional challenges for the coming decades. This agenda compels us to further develop our field, reduce silos, and stimulate collaboration.
