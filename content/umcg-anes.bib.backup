  abstract = {Many patients experience nausea and vomiting after surgery, which can be very uncomfortable and may delay recovery. Despite preventive medications, this problem remains common, particularly in women, non-smokers and those with a previous history of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Our research aimed to improve PONV prevention for a quicker, and more comfortable recovery.
  We identified groups more likely to experience PONV, focusing on clinical factors, ethnicity and genetics. Notably, a specific gene (the C allele of P2RX7) may protect against vomiting. We also confirmed that individuals with a prior PONV or motion sickness are at a higher risk of experiencing it again. These insights could guide more personalised PONV prevention strategies in the future.
  Our study also evaluated medicines like olanzapine, aprepitant, and fosaprepitant. Combining certain drugs significantly reduced PONV, while others were less effective. Olanzapine, typically used for mental health conditions, worked well alongside standard treatments, significantly lowering the chances of PONV. However, aprepitant, a drug specifically approved to prevent PONV, did not show much benefit when combined with another drug called palonosetron. After reviewing available studies, we concluded that while these medications help prevent PONV, their effectiveness depends on how they are combined.
  Overall, our findings suggest that we can enhance the prevention of these unpleasant side effects by understanding patient’s individual risk factors and using a combination of medications targeting different factors contributing to PONV. These insights can help improve patient care by making recovery from surgery more comfortable and reducing the risk for complications.},

  abstract = {The presence of a hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease often presents with severe, disabling symptoms and is known to result into a poor quality-of-life for many patients. Nevertheless, it’s often seen by patients and physicians alike as an ailment to be treated by antacids, not as serious disease warranting surgery.  
  While most hiatal hernia are straightforward, in some rare cases the pancreas herniates along with the other organs into the thoracic cavity. Little is known about how to proceed surgically. Furthermore, some patients are hindered in their daily life by symptoms of delayed gastric emptying. Antireflux surgery is known to enhance gastric emptying speeds in most cases. Some patients, however, see their gastric emptying worsened. The mechanism behind this phenomenon remains mostly unclear.  
  When a hiatal hernia recurs or symptoms persist following primary antireflux surgery, a whole battery of diagnostic tests are done to find the mechanism of failure and therefore also the optimal mode of treatment. We hypothesize that computed tomography (CT) scanning of the gastroesphageal junction offers sufficient information to classify the underlying mechanism of failure.
  Current treatment of hiatal hernia is largely standardized in the Netherlands. Most centers perform partial laparoscopic fundoplications. Some centers, however, see benefits in using robotic assistance.  
  And finally, the question remains on how best to treat those patients with severe symptoms and poor quality-of-life following (multiple) previous failed antireflux surgeries and are currently left without any treatment options.  
  The aims of this thesis are to find out why the number of referrals for surgery remain lacking in the Netherlands, to describe our experience with intrathoracic herniation of the pancreas, to find the incidence of delayed gastric emptying in patients with large and small hiatal hernia, to describe the effects of surgery on gastric motility, to look at the value of CT-scanning in patients with recurrent disease, to look at the benefits of robotic assistance in primary and redo antireflux surgery, and to describe the development of a novel robot assisted transthoracic minimal-invasive approach for redo-antireflux surgery.},

Concentrations of venous midazolam and 1'-OH-midazolam, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score, bispectral index (BIS), arterial pressure, ECG, and respiratory parameters were measured for 10 h. Time to peak effect of intranasal midazolam for BIS, MAP, and SpO Intranasal bioavailability was high and sedation onset was rapid, with maximum sedative effects after 32 min. We developed a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for intranasal midazolam for older persons and an online tool to simulate changes in MOAA/S, BIS, MAP, and SpO EudraCT (2019-004806-90).},

  abstract = {Different bronchoscopic lung volume reduction approaches are available for a select group of patients with advanced COPD. General anaesthesia is the recommended method of sedation during these procedures. However, this patient population is at an increased risk of anaesthetic complications, and the best approach to general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation is unknown. The aims of this study were to describe the anaesthetic management techniques used during bronchoscopic lung volume reduction procedures and to investigate the number of anaesthesia-related events. Data were retrospectively collected from all endobronchial valve and lung volume reduction coil procedures performed between January 2018 and March 2020 in our hospital. Primary outcomes measures were anaesthetic technique including airway management; ventilation mode and settings; and the incidence of anaesthesia-related events, classified as catastrophic, severe, significant, or moderate. 202 procedures were included. One procedure was performed under procedural sedation, 198 (98%) under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation, and 3 (1.5%) under general anaesthesia with laryngeal mask airway. Volume-controlled ventilation was used in 64% of the procedures and pressure-controlled in 36%. Patients were ventilated with a median respiration rate of 9.9 (IQR: 9.6-10.6) breaths per minute, mean tidal volume of 5.8 ± 1.4 mL/kg, and median inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2.8 (IQR: 1:2.1-1:3.2). No catastrophic anaesthesia-related events were observed. Hypotension was the most observed anaesthesia-related event. Despite the presence of advanced COPD, general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation are well tolerated by patients undergoing endobronchial valve or lung volume reduction coil treatment. This is presumably strongly linked to the strict selection criteria. Other important considerations are using a low respiratory rate, low tidal volume, and high I:E ratio.},

We evaluated the reverse interaction and determined the influence of propofol on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. Eight healthy male volunteers were studied on 2 occasions in a random crossover manner. During session A, volunteers received midazolam 0.035 to 0.05 mg x kg(-1) IV for 1 minute followed by an infusion of 0.035 to 0.05 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 59 minutes. During session B, in addition to this midazolam infusion scheme, a target-controlled infusion of propofol (constant C(T): 0.6 or 1.0 microg x mL(-1)) was given from 15 minutes before the start until 6 hours after termination of the midazolam infusion. Arterial blood samples for propofol and midazolam concentration analysis were taken until 6 hours after termination of the midazolam infusion. Nonlinear mixed-effect models examining the influence of propofol and hemodynamic variables on midazolam pharmacokinetics were constructed using Akaike's information-theoretic criterion for model selection. In the presence of a mean blood propofol concentration of 1.2 microg x mL(-1), the plasma midazolam concentration was increased by 26.9% + or - 9.4% compared with midazolam given as a single drug. Propofol (C(blood): 1.2 microg x mL(-1)) reduced midazolam central volume of distribution from 5.37 to 2.98 L, elimination clearance from 0.39 to 0.31 L x min(-1), and rapid distribution clearance from 2.77 to 2.11 L x min(-1). Inclusion of heart rate further improved the pharmacokinetic model of midazolam. Propofol reduces the distribution and clearance of midazolam in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, inclusion of heart rate as a covariate improved the pharmacokinetic model of midazolam predominantly through a reduction in the intraindividual variability.},

This article describes the current strategies regarding the application of this type of anaesthesia, focusing on three strategic tools: (i) application of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic knowledge of propofol and the opioids, with particular attention to pharmacodynamic interactions between them; (ii) the use of state-of-the-art administration techniques; and (iii) the application of bispectral index monitoring. Together, these techniques have improved the level of control, the flexibility and the safety of anaesthetic practice.},

Cholesterol-containing cationic liposomes that encapsulate complementary DNA (cDNA) are nonviral carriers used for in vivo gene transfection. We propose that liposome IGF-I gene transfer will accelerate wound healing in burned rats and attenuate deleterious side-effects associated with high levels of IGF-I. To test this hypothesis IGF-I gene constructs, encapsulated in liposomes, were studied for their efficacy in modulating the thermal injury response. Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a 60% TBSA scald burn and randomly divided into three groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the lacZ gene coding for beta-galactosidase, liposomes plus cDNA for IGF-I and beta-galactosidase or liposomes plus the rhIGF-I protein. Body weights and wound healing were measured. Muscle and liver dry/wet weights and IGF-I concentrations in serum, skin and liver were measured by radioimmunoassay. Transfection was confirmed by histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase. Rats receiving the IGF-I cDNA constructs exhibited the most rapid wound re-epithelialization and greatest increase in body weight and gastrocnemius muscle protein content (P < 0.05). Local IGF-I protein concentrations in the skin were higher when compared to liposomes containing only the lacZ gene (P < 0.05) Transfection was apparent in the cytoplasm of myofibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages of the granulation tissue. Liposomes containing the IGF-I gene constructs proved effective in preventing muscle protein wasting and preserving total body weight after a severe thermal injury.},

Haemodynamic (mean arterial pressure [MAP], heart rate) and hypnotic (bispectral index [BIS]) stability was studied. The predictive performance of four alternative propofol PK models was studied. MdPE and MdAPE did not differ between groups during the pre-adjustment period (control group: 6.3% and 16%; intervention group: 5.4% and 18%). MdPE differed in the post-adjustment period (12% vs. -0.3%), but MdAPE did not (18% vs. 15%). No difference in heart rate, MAP or BIS was found. Compared with the other models, the Eleveld propofol PK model (patients) showed the best prediction performance. When an accurate population-based PK model was used for propofol TCI, Bayesian adaption of the model improved bias but not precision. Dutch Trial Registry NTR4518.},

Serum haptoglobin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein levels decreased at 2, 5, and 7 days after burn compared to saline (P < 0.05). In rats treated with rhGH, serum IL-1beta decreased 1 day postburn, while serum TNF-alpha increased 5 days after burn compared to saline (P < 0.05). Serum IL-6 and IL-1alpha did not change. Hepatic RNA levels for TNF-alpha were significantly elevated on Day 1 postburn compared to saline (P < 0. 05). Hepatic protein content increased on Days 2, 5, and 7 postburn compared to saline (P < 0.05). Hepatocyte proliferation in rhGH-treated rats increased on Day 5 after burn (P < 0.05). Data indicate that rhGH alters the hepatic acute phase response by decreasing type I acute phase proteins and modulating IL-1-like cytokine expression. These changes are associated with increased hepatocyte mitosis and serum and total liver protein concentrations.},

Although the reasons may be many, the lack of a simplified algorithm for the assessment of DD specific to the perioperative arena, the implications of this diagnosis on clinical care, and the absence of therapeutic options are some of the commonly cited reasons. In this article, the authors address these possible reasons for the lack of routine application of Doppler indices to assess perioperative DD. The authors have chosen to highlight some of the most common conceptual questions, which often have been raised by anesthesiologists, and attempted to suggest answers. Drawing from their experience and data, the authors propose a simplified algorithm for the application of Doppler to assess and diagnose DD with an individualized and a mechanistic approach. The proposed algorithm is from within the premise of the published guidelines and attempts to simplify the perioperative approach. The authors hope this approach will be simple enough for routine application to affect therapy and a tangible change in outcome. The authors suggest that knowledge of left atrial size is valuable as a marker for persistently increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and its possible role in risk stratification.},

  abstract = {Chronic pain is often difficult to manage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients and sometimes even leads to nephrectomy. We analyzed the long-term efficacy of our innovative multidisciplinary protocol to treat chronic refractory pain that aims to preserve kidney function by applying among other sequential nerve blocks. Patients were eligible if pain was present ≥3 months with a score of ≥50 on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100, was negatively affecting quality of life and if there had been insufficient response to previous therapies, including opioid treatment. Treatment options were, in order, analgesics, cyst aspiration and fenestration, nerve blocks and nephrectomy. A total of 101 patients were assessed in our clinic (mean age 50 ± 11 years, 65.3% females). Eight patients were treated with medication, 6 by cyst aspiration or fenestration, 63 by nerve blocks and 6 received surgery as the first treatment option. Overall, 76.9% experienced a positive effect on pain complaints shortly after treatment. The VAS score was reduced from 60/100 to 20/100 (P < 0.001) and patients decreased their number of nonopioid and opioid analgesics significantly (P < 0.001, P = 0.01, respectively). A substantial number of the patients (n = 51) needed additional treatment. At the end of follow-up in only 13 patients (12.9%) was surgical intervention necessary: 11 nephrectomies (of which 10 were in patients already on kidney function replacement treatment), 1 liver transplantation and 1 partial hepatectomy. After a median follow-up of 4.5 years (interquartile range 2.5-5.3), 69.0% of the patients still had fewer pain complaints. These data indicate that our multidisciplinary treatment protocol appears effective in reducing pain in the majority of patients with chronic refractory pain, while postponing or even avoiding in most patients surgical interventions such as nephrectomy in most patients.},

  abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients can suffer from chronic pain that can be refractory to conventional treatment, resulting in a wish for nephrectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol with sequential nerve blocks on pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain. As a first step a diagnostic, temporary celiac plexus block with local anesthetics was performed. If substantial pain relief was obtained, the assumption was that pain was relayed via the celiac plexus and major splanchnic nerves. When pain recurred, patients were then scheduled for a major splanchnic nerve block with radiofrequency ablation. In cases with no pain relief, it was assumed that pain was relayed via the aortico-renal plexus, and catheter-based renal denervation was performed. Sixty patients were referred, of which 44 were eligible. In 36 patients the diagnostic celiac plexus block resulted in substantial pain relief with a change in the median visual analogue scale (VAS) score pre-post intervention of 50/100. Of these patients, 23 received a major splanchnic nerve block because pain recurred, with a change in median VAS pre-post block of 53/100. In 8 patients without pain relief after the diagnostic block, renal denervation was performed in 5, with a borderline significant change in the median VAS pre-post intervention of 20/100. After a median follow-up of 12 months, 81.8% of the patients experienced a sustained improvement in pain intensity, indicating that our treatment protocol is effective in obtaining pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain.},

Relevant outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS research have not been previously defined. National consensus was sought to identify relevant long term patient outcome parameters, process outcome parameters and performance outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS care. This was a mixed methods Delphi consensus study. A list of potentially relevant outcome parameters was identified using a systematic literature review. These parameters were subsequently surveyed in a Delphi consensus study. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services physicians and relevant stakeholders were invited to participate in this Delphi survey, where they were allowed to suggest additional outcome parameters. Descriptive analysis was performed on all data sets. Forty-nine potential outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS care were surveyed. Of 71 invited participants, 53 (75%), 40 (56%), and 20 (28%) participated in the first, second, and third round of the Delphi study, respectively. Consensus was reached on 25 (51%) of 49 outcome parameters as being important. These consisted of seven long term patient related outcome parameters, four short term patient related outcome parameters, five process outcome parameters and nine performance outcome parameters. In conclusion, this study identified 25 outcome parameters relevant for Dutch physician staffed HEMS care. These parameters should be considered when designing future studies and should be routinely collected for each dispatch if possible.},

Retrospective observational study. Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands, over a 14-year period from January 2005 to December 2018. The study included 99 consecutive patients with simple dextro-transposition of the great arteries with or without a ventricular septal defect. All patients received preoperative management including intravenous prostaglandin E1 and, when necessary, a balloon atrial septostomy. Patients were then scheduled for an arterial switch operation. Patients were divided into a PPHN and a non-PPHN group. The outcomes assessed included mortality (overall, preoperative, 30-day postoperative and late mortality) and postoperative morbidity (length of ventilatory support, intensive care unit and hospital stay, delayed sternal closure and resternotomy). PPHN was present in 31% of patients. Overall mortality was 8.1%, with no difference between PPHN and non-PPHN patients (9.7 v 7.4%, p = 0.70). PPHN had no effect on morbidity outcomes. A lower weight at birth was associated with preoperative mortality. Duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative hypotension were associated with longer intensive care unit stay. Intraoperative hypotension and cerebral oxygen desaturation had no significant impact on mortality. PPHN did not significantly affect perioperative morbidity and mortality in d-TGA patients, suggesting a more favorable prognosis than previously reported.},

We present the case of a 55-year-old man undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery for severe MR caused by posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe MR with no significant aortic valve abnormalities. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) initially showed a high transvalvular aortic gradient (3 m/s) in the transgastric long-axis view, suggestive of mild-to-moderate AS. However, detailed Doppler analysis revealed a double envelope signal, representing both eccentric MR and true aortic valve flow. The closer evaluation showed the MR signal occurred earlier in the cardiac cycle, aligning with its hemodynamic timing, while the true aortic flow followed isovolumetric contraction. Subsequent three-dimensional TEE confirmed normal aortic valve morphology and function. This case highlights the importance of correlating preoperative findings, Doppler signal timing, and imaging data to avoid misdiagnosis. Systematic echocardiographic evaluation, including signal timing analysis, can differentiate between MR and AS, ensuring accurate intraoperative decision-making and preventing unnecessary interventions.},

  abstract = {The exact onset of brain injury in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. Our aim was, therefore, to assess the association between prenatal Doppler flow patterns, postnatal cerebral oxygenation and short-term neurological outcome. Prenatally, we measured pulsatility indices of the middle cerebral (MCA-PI) and umbilical artery (UA-PI) and calculated cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). After birth, cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) were assessed during the first 3 days after birth, and during and for 24 hours after every surgical procedure within the first 3 months after birth. Neurological outcome was determined preoperatively and at 3 months of age by assessing general movements and calculating the Motor Optimality Score (MOS). Thirty-six infants were included. MOS at 3 months was associated with MCA-PI (rho 0.41, P = 0.04), UA-PI (rho -0.39, P = 0.047, and CPR (rho 0.50, P = 0.01). Infants with abnormal MOS had lower MCA-PI (P = 0.02) and CPR (P = 0.01) and higher UA-PI at the last measurement (P = 0.03) before birth. In infants with abnormal MOS, rcSO2 tended to be lower during the first 3 days after birth, and FTOE was significantly higher on the second day after birth (P = 0.04). Intraoperative and postoperative rcSO2 and FTOE were not associated with short-term neurological outcome. In infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD, the prenatal period may play an important role in developmental outcome. Additional research is needed to clarify the relationship between preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative cerebral oxygenation and developmental outcome in infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD.},

In acute normovolemic haemodilution autologous unfractionated heparinised blood is stored ex-vivo and retransfused at the end of the procedure to reduce (allogeneic) transfusion requirements. In this observational study we assessed whether platelet function is better preserved in ex vivo stored autologous blood compared to platelet function in the patient during CPB. We measured platelet aggregation responses pre-CPB, 5 min after the start of CPB, at the end of CPB, and after unfractionated heparin reversal, using multiple electrode aggregometry (Multiplate®) with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) and ristocetin activated test cells. We compared blood samples taken from the patient with samples taken from 100 ml ex-vivo stored blood, which we took to mimick blood storage during normovolemic haemodilution. Platelet function declined both in ex-vivo stored blood as well as in blood taken from the patient. At the end of CPB there were no differences in platelet aggregation responses between samples from the ex vivo stored blood and the patient. Ex vivo preservation of autologous blood in unfractionated heparin does not seem to be profitable to preserve platelet function.},

All 67 consecutive adult patients who were admitted to the ICU of the University Medical Center Groningen in the period 2010-2013 and received extracorporeal life support treatment. None. The bottom-up microcosting method was used except when stated otherwise. Medical costs were estimated by multiplying every registered healthcare consumption with unit prices. Unit prices were largely based on Dutch reference prices. For each patient, the personnel costs and material costs were assessed in detail. The costs of extracorporeal life support were differentiated in costs of procedures and costs of daily surcharge of therapy. Procedure-related costs were subdivided in costs of devices and disposables, costs of additional human resources, and surgery hours. The mean total hospital costs were € 106.263 (€ 83.841 to € 126.266) per patient ($145,580). On average, 52% of the total costs arose from hospital nursing days and 11% of direct procedure-related extracorporeal life support costs. Surgery and diagnostics represented a vast amount of the remaining costs. This large and detailed economic evaluation of hospital costs of extracorporeal life support therapy in the Netherlands showed that mean total hospital cost of extracorporeal life support treatment is € 106.263 per patient. The majority of the costs are composed of nursing days.},

We successfully implanted a transcatheter aortic valve in emergency setting. The patient recovered and underwent cardiac transplantation three months afterwards. We performed a systematic literature review and identified 10 cases of patients with a left ventricle assist device undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation. In these cases, there was no procedural related mortality reported. In four (40%) patients, transcatheter aortic valve implantation resulted in significant paravalvular aortic regurgitation. In two of these cases it was due to migration of the valve towards the left ventricle. Our case report and review of literature suggests that transcatheter aortic valve implantation is a feasible and lifesaving treatment option for left ventricle assist device patients presenting with severe aortic regurgitation.},

We compared the preservation of platelet function and the quality of anticoagulation in autologous blood of 26 cardiac surgical patients collected intraoperatively and anticoagulated ex vivo with either bivalirudin or heparin, with supplementation of bivalirudin over time and prevention of stasis. We found in both preservatives a reduction in ADP-induced platelet aggregation response over a period of 105 minutes (median, IQR: 73-141) as measured by Multiplate®. Supplementation of additional bivalirudin (23 ± 1.1 μg/ml/hr) and prevention of stasis was not able to prevent thrombin generation. We found a 5-fold increase in levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 in bivalirudin preserved autologous blood as compared to heparin preserved blood (F(1+2) levels median 8.9 nM [quartile percentiles 4.2-12.4] vs 1.3 nM [0.6-2.1], P=0.001 Mann-Whitney, n=10).

Patient records and transfusion data, divided into 5-year intervals, were analyzed. The incidence of massive transfusion (>10 units of red blood cells [RBCs] in 24 h) was 27% and did not change over time, whereas the median (interquartile range) transfusion requirement in the whole cohort decreased from 8 (5-12) to 3 (0-10) RBCs (p < 0.001).

Multivariable analysis showed that circulatory support, pulmonary hypertension, re-transplantation, cystic fibrosis, Eisenmenger syndrome, bilateral transplantation, and low body mass index were associated with massive transfusion. Patients with massive transfusion had more primary graft dysfunction grade III at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours (p < 0.001), higher 30-day mortality (13% v 4%; p < 0.001), and lower 5-year survival (hazard ratio 3.67 [95% confidence interval 1.72-7.85]; p < 0.001). The incidence of massive transfusion did not change over time, whereas transfusion requirements in the whole cohort decreased.

  abstract = {Anemia is a common feature during sepsis that occurs due to iatrogenic blood loss, depression of serum iron levels and erythropoietin production, and a decreased lifespan of erythrocytes. However, these mechanisms are unlikely to play a role in anemia at the start of sepsis. Moreover, sequestration of fluids, renal failure and increase of intravascular space may additionally influence the change in hemoglobin concentration during intravenous fluid administration in the acute phase of sepsis. In this retrospective study, patients who were admitted acutely to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. Patients who fulfilled the international criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock were included in the sepsis group (S-group). The remaining patients were allocated to the control group (C-group). Laboratory data from blood samples taken at first presentation to the hospital and at admission to the ICU, the amount of intravenous fluid administration and length of stay in the emergency department were collected and tested for significant differences between groups. The difference in hemoglobin concentration between the S-group (n = 296) and C-group (n = 320) at first presentation in hospital was not significant (8.8 ± 1.2 versus 8.9 ± 1.2 mmol/l, respectively, p = 0.07). The reduction in hemoglobin concentration from the first presentation at the emergency department to ICU admission was significantly greater in the S-group compared to the C-group (1 [0.5-1.7] versus 0.5 [0.1-1.1] mmol/l, (p < 0.001)). Spearman rho correlation coefficients between the reduction in hemoglobin concentration and the amount of intravenous fluids administered or the creatinine level in the emergency department were significant (0.3 and 0.4, respectively, p < 0.001). In a multivariate regression analysis, creatinine, the amount of fluid administration and the presence of sepsis remained independently associated. Prior to in-hospital intravenous fluid administration, there is no significant difference in hemoglobin concentration between acute septic patients and acutely ill controls. Within several hours after hospital admission, there is a significant reduction in hemoglobin concentration, not only associated with the amount of intravenous fluids administered and the creatinine level, but also independently with sepsis itself.},

  abstract = {Individuals can make choices based on information learned from others, a phenomenon called social learning. How observers differentiate between which individual they should or should not learn from is, however, poorly understood. Here, we showed that Drosophila melanogaster females can influence the choice of egg-laying site of other females through pheromonal marking. Mated females mark territories of high quality food by ejecting surplus male sperm containing the aggregation pheromone cis-11-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) and, in addition, deposit several sex- and species-specific cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) pheromones. These pheromonal cues affect the choices of other females, which respond by preferentially laying eggs on the marked food. This system benefits both senders and responders, as communal egg laying increases offspring survival. Virgin females, however, do not elicit a change in the egg-laying decision of mated females, even when food has been supplemented with ejected sperm from mated females, thus indicating the necessity for additional cues. Genetic ablation of either a female's CHC pheromones or those of their mate results in loss of ability of mated females to attract other females. We conclude that mated females use a pheromonal marking system, comprising cVA acquired from male ejaculate with sex- and species-specific CHCs produced by both mates, to indicate egg-laying sites. This system ensures information reliability because mated, but not virgin, females have both the ability to generate the pheromone blend that attracts other flies to those sites and a direct interest in egg-laying site quality.},

Initiation of venoarterial ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) during resuscitation might improve outcomes if used in time and in a selected patient category. However, previous studies have failed to significantly reduce the time from cardiac arrest to ECMO flow to less than 60 min. We hypothesize that the initiation of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) by a Helicopter Emergency Medical Services System (HEMS) will reduce the low flow time and improve outcomes in refractory Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) patients. The ON-SCENE study will use a non-randomised stepped wedge design to implement ECPR in patients with witnessed OHCA between the ages of 18-50 years old, with an initial presentation of shockable rhythm or pulseless electrical activity with a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism, lasting more than 20, but less than 45 min. Patients will be treated by the ambulance crew and HEMS with prehospital ECPR capabilities and will be compared with treatment by ambulance crew and HEMS without prehospital ECPR capabilities. The primary outcome measure will be survival at hospital discharge. The secondary outcome measure will be good neurological outcome defined as a cerebral performance categories scale score of 1 or 2 at 6 and 12 months. The ON-SCENE study focuses on initiating ECPR at the scene of OHCA using HEMS. The current in-hospital ECPR for OHCA obstacles encompassing low survival rates in refractory arrests, extended low-flow durations during transportation, and the critical time sensitivity of initiating ECPR, which could potentially be addressed through the implementation of the HEMS system.

Increased polyol concentrations have been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neurological patients with and without diabetes mellitus. However, polyol levels in patients without evident neurological abnormalities have not been investigated so far. The aim of this study was to determine CSF polyol concentrations in patients without major neurological disease with normal or elevated CSF glucose concentrations. This observational cohort study used CSF and plasma analyses, as well as clinical data, from 30 participants of the Anaesthetic Biobank of Cerebrospinal Fluid study. Biomaterial was collected from adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under spinal anaesthesia. CSF polyol concentrations were measured by GC/flame ionisation detector in ten patients with normal CSF glucose levels (group 1), ten patients with elevated CSF glucose levels (group 2) and ten patients with elevated CSF glucose levels and type 2 diabetes (group 3). We compared the concentrations of plasma glucose, CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose, and CSF polyol/glucose ratios between the three groups, and determined the correlation between plasma glucose levels and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose levels. Groups 2 and 3 had significantly higher CSF fructose levels compared with group 1 (p=0.036 and p<0.001, respectively). Group 3 showed significant differences compared with groups 1 and 2 for CSF sorbitol (p<0.001 and 0.036, respectively). Moreover, patients with diabetes had a significantly higher CSF sorbitol/glucose ratio compared with patients without diabetes. There was a strong positive correlation between plasma glucose and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose. Finally, age, sex, CSF/plasma albumin ratio and preoperative cognitive function scores were significantly correlated with plasma glucose and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose levels. Hyperglycaemia causes a proportional increase in polyol concentrations in CSF of patients without major neurological disease. Furthermore, this study provides the first indication of upregulation of the cerebral polyol pathway in patients with diabetes without evident neurological abnormalities.},

Neurological outcome was classified as cerebral performance category (CPC) at hospital discharge and long-term survival was compared with younger patients and predicted survival rates of the general population. Of the 810 patients admitted after OHCA, a total of 551 patients (68%) achieved return of spontaneous circulation, including 125 (23%) elderly patients with a mean age of 81 ± 5 years. In-hospital survival was lower in elderly patients compared with younger patients with rates of 33% versus 57% ( p < 0.001). A CPC of 1 was present in 73% of the elderly patients versus 86% of the younger patients ( p = 0.031).

Among 499 severe TBI patients analyzed (median age 43 years), helmet use significantly reduced epidural mass (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-0.60,  Among patients with severe TBI, those wearing helmets showed epidural mass lesions and skull fractures less frequently, but more often had cervical fractures than those not wearing helmets.},

  abstract = {Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using a mixture of propofol and remifentanil in the same syringe has become an accepted technique in Pediatric Anesthesia. A survey by a group of respected UK anesthetists demonstrated a low incidence of serious complications, related to the pharmacology and dose of the drugs. However, a current guideline for the safe use of TIVA recommends against this practice. Pharmaceutical concerns include the physical stability of the emulsion when remifentanil is mixed with propofol; changes in drug concentration over time; nonuniform mixing of propofol and remifentanil; the risk of bacterial contamination; and the potential for drug administration errors. Propofol and remifentanil have markedly different pharmacokinetic profiles. When remifentanil is mixed with propofol and delivered as a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol, remifentanil delivery is not target-controlled but passively follows the variable infusion rates calculated by the syringe driver to deliver predicted plasma or effect-site concentrations of propofol. The pharmacokinetic consequences can be illustrated using pharmacokinetic modeling similar to that used in TCI pumps. The clinical consequences reflect the dose-dependent pharmacodynamics of remifentanil. Increasing the target propofol concentration produces a rapid increase and peak in remifentanil concentration that risks apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension, especially with higher concentrations of remifentanil. The faster decline in remifentanil concentration with falling propofol concentrations risks inadequate narcosis and unwanted responses to surgical stimuli. Remifentanil delivery is inflexible and dosing cannot be adjusted to the clinical need and responses of individual patients. The medicolegal considerations are stark. In UK and EU Law, mixing propofol and remifentanil creates a new, unlicensed drug and the person mixing takes on the responsibilities of manufacturer. If a patient receiving anesthesia in the form of a mixed propofol-remifentanil infusion suffered a critical incident or actual harm, the clinician's practice may come under scrutiny and criticism, potentially involving a legal challenge and the Medical Regulator.},

Patients receiving PCC had worse preoperative coagulopathy, model for end-stage liver disease scores, and comorbidities. Patients exposed to PCC had a comparable mean number of red blood cell (RBC), plasma, or platelet units transfused. Use of viscoelastic testing-based algorithms incorporating PCC compared with usual care was associated with reduced odds of RBC exposure (odds ratio [OR]: 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-0.86, I Although there are no randomised trials comparing use of PCC vs FP in LT, their efficacy and safety appear comparable.

Since she deteriorated under treatment with inotropes, she was referred to our centre, and veno-arterial extracorporeal life support was started. Subsequently, the aortic valve only opened sporadically, and spontaneous contrast appeared in the left ventricle (LV), pointing towards difficulties with unloading LV. Therefore, an Impella for venting the LV was implanted. After 6 days of mechanical circulatory support, her heart function recovered. All support could be weaned, and 2 months later, she had made a full recovery. We presented a patient with severe cardiogenic shock due to an acute virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the precise aetiology of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis remains to be elucidated and no virus could be detected in the heart, a causal relationship remains speculative.},

Recto-perineal and recto-vestibular fistulas were classified as mild CARMs, all others as severe. Significant patent foramen ovale, secundum atrial septal defect, and small ventricular septum defect were classified as minor CHDs, all others as major. Of 129 patients with CARM, 67% had mild CARM, 33% severe CARM, and 17% were additionally diagnosed with CHD. CHDs were distributed equally in patients with mild or severe CARMs. Patients with multiple congenital abnormalities were more frequently diagnosed with CHD (n = 16, 36%) than patients without multiple congenital malformations (n = 5, 9%, P = .001). Patients with CARM diagnosed with CHD using pediatric cardiac echo screening were younger than 3 months of age at diagnosis. Earlier general pediatric examinations missed 7 (50%) children with mild and 4 (50%) with severe CHDs. The severity of CARM could predict neither prevalence nor severity of CHD. More than one-half of CHDs were missed during the first physical examination. No new CHDs were found in patients older than 3 months of age at the time CARMs were diagnosed. We recommend screening all patients with CARM younger than 3 months of age for CHD at the time CARM is diagnosed. Preoperative echocardiography should be the rule in children younger than 3 months of age and with multiple congenital anomalies.},

Nevertheless, it is frequently prescribed to pediatric patients as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia or for procedural sedation. There is ample literature on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in this vulnerable patient population, but there is a general lack of consensus on dosing. In this project, we aimed to use the standardized workflow of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary to establish best evidence-based pediatric dosing guidelines for dexmedetomidine as premedication and for procedural sedation. The available literature on dexmedetomidine in pediatrics was reviewed in order to address the following three questions: (1) What is the right dose? (2) What is known about efficacy? (3) What is known about safety? Relevant literature was compiled into a risk-benefit analysis document. A team of clinical experts critically appraised the analysis and the proposed dosing recommendations. Dexmedetomidine is most commonly administered via the intravenous or intranasal route. Clearance is age dependent, warranting higher doses in infants to reach similar exposure as in adults. Dexmedetomidine use results in satisfactory sedation at parent separation, adequate sedation and a favorable recovery profile. The safety profile is good and comparable to adults, with dose-related hemodynamic effects. Following the structured approach of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary, best evidence-based dosing recommendations were proposed for dexmedetomidine, used as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia (intranasal dose) and for procedural sedation (intranasal and intravenous dose) in pediatric patients.},

In the paediatric cohort, there were 410 (2.9%) complications and 1675 (2.5%) in the adults. In both cohorts age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists classification and emergency treatment were independent risk factors for complications. With respect to age, infants less than 1 year were at the highest risk, whereas in the adult cohort, increased age was related to a greater number of complications. The incidences of the specific complications were different between both cohorts. Upper airway obstruction was more frequently observed in paediatric patients (26%), whereas in the adults, complications with the highest incidence concerned conversion of regional-to-general anaesthesia (25%) and hypotension (17%).

Knowledge on current pain assessment and treatment in BU is necessary to develop and implement a future guideline on pain management in BU. A mixed methods approach was used, consisting of information retrieved from medical records on prescribed pain medication from Ghana and Benin, and semi-structured interviews with health care personnel (HCP) from Ghana on pain perceptions, assessment and treatment. Medical records (n = 149) of patients treated between 2008 and 2012 were collected between November 2012 and August 2013. Interviews (n = 11) were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and qualitatively analyzed. In 113 (84%) of the 135 included records, pain medication, mostly simple analgesics, was prescribed. In 48% of the prescriptions, an indication was not documented. HCP reported that advanced BU could be painful, especially after wound care and after a skin graft. They reported not be trained in the assessment of mild pain. Pain recognition was perceived as difficult, as patients were said to suppress or to exaggerate pain, and to have different expectations regarding acceptable pain levels. HCP reported a fear of side effects of pain medication, shortage and irregularities in the supply of pain medication, and time constraints among medical doctors for pain management. Professionals perceived BU disease as potentially painful, and predominantly focused on severe pain. Our study suggests that pain in BU deserves attention and should be integrated in current treatment.},

We examined whether middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients show reduced white matter integrity in fiber tracts important for cognition and whether this abnormality is related to preestablished altered resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN). Diabetic and nondiabetic participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessment. Multiple diffusion measures were calculated using streamline tractography, and correlations with DMN functional connectivity were determined. Diabetic patients showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (a measure of white matter integrity) in the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus. Control subjects showed stronger functional connectivity than patients between the posterior cingulate and both left fusiform and medial frontal gyri. FA of the cingulum bundle was correlated with functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus for combined groups. Thus, middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes show white matter abnormalities that correlate with disrupted functional connectivity in the DMN, suggesting that common mechanisms may underlie structural and functional connectivity.

  abstract = {Multiple pregnancies are high risk pregnancies with higher chances of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. In the past decades the number of multiple pregnancies has increased. This trend is partly due to the fact that women start family planning at an increased age, but also due to the increased use of ART.Couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility generally receive intrauterine insemination IUI with controlled hormonal stimulation (IUI COH). The cumulative pregnancy rate is 40%, with a 10% multiple pregnancy rate.This study aims to reveal whether alternative treatments such as IVF elective Single Embryo Transfer (IVF e SET) or Modified Natural Cycle IVF (MNC IVF) can reduce the number of multiple pregnancy rates, but uphold similar pregnancy rates as IUI COH in couples with mild male or unexplained subfertility. Secondly, the aim is to perform a cost effective analyses and assess treatment preference of these couples. We plan a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of intra-uterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation or six cycles of Modified Natural Cycle (MNC) IVF or three cycles with IVF-elective Single Embryo Transfer (eSET) plus cryo-cycles within a time frame of 12 months.Couples with unexplained subfertility or mild male subfertility and a poor prognosis for treatment independent pregnancy will be included. Women with anovulatory cycles, severe endometriosis, double sided tubal pathology or serious endocrine illness will be excluded.Our primary outcome is the birth of a healthy singleton. Secondary outcomes are multiple pregnancy, treatment costs, and patient experiences in each treatment arm. The analysis will be performed according tot the intention to treat principle. We will test for non-inferiority of the three arms with respect to live birth. As we accept a 12.5% loss in pregnancy rate in one of the two IVF arms to prevent multiple pregnancies, we need 200 couples per arm (600 couples in total). Determining the safest and most cost-effective treatment will ensure optimal chances of pregnancy for subfertile couples with substantially diminished perinatal and maternal complications. Should patients find the most cost-effective treatment acceptable or even preferable, this could imply the need for a world wide shift in the primary treatment.

If women do not conceive, treatment can be continued with gonadotropins or intra-uterine insemination (IUI). At present, it is unclear for how many cycles ovulation induction with CC should be repeated, and when to switch to ovulation induction with gonadotropins and/or IUI. We started a multicenter randomised controlled trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of CC plus intercourse or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus intercourse or six cycles of CC plus IUI or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus IUI.Women with WHO type II anovulation who ovulate but did not conceive after six ovulatory cycles of CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days will be included.Our primary outcome is birth of a healthy child resulting from a pregnancy that was established in the first eight months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and treatment costs. The analysis will be performed according to the intention to treat principle. Two comparisons will be made, one in which CC is compared to gonadotrophins and one in which the addition of IUI is compared to ovulation induction only. Assuming a live birth rate of 40% after CC, 55% after addition of IUI and 55% after ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, with an alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, we need to recruit 200 women per arm (800 women in total).An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee has criticized the data of the first 150 women and concluded that a sample size re-estimation should be performed after including 320 patients (i.e. 80 per arm).

  abstract = {To evaluate the capacity of the postcoital test (PCT) to predict spontaneous pregnancy in a large cohort study of subfertile couples. Prospective study. Department of reproductive medicine of 38 hospitals in the Netherlands. Between January 2002 and February 2004, we prospectively included consecutive subfertile couples who had not been evaluated previously for subfertility. We estimated the contribution of the PCT result to the existing prediction model for spontaneous pregnancy by calculating the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of an abnormal PCT result. We constructed a second prediction model (PCT model) based on the reference model including the PCT. Primary endpoint in this study was ongoing pregnancy. We evaluated the performance of the PCT model in comparison with the reference model by calculating goodness of fit, discrimination, calibration, and the "net reclassification improvement". We included 3,021 couples of whom 537 (18%) had a spontaneous pregnancy and 55 (1.8%) a nonsuccessful pregnancy; 1,316 (44%) started treatment within 12 months, 824 (27%) neither started treatment nor became pregnant, and 289 (10%) became lost to follow-up within 12 months. The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62 to 0.94). The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.84) in case of no spermatozoa, 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57 to 1.2) in case of nonmotile spermatozoa, and 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.8) in case of motile, nonprogressive spermatozoa. Adding the PCT result to the reference model did not improve goodness of fit. Discrimination was equally poor for the PCT model and the reference model. The calibration plots of both models showed comparably good calibration. The net reclassification improvement of the predictions of the PCT model compared with the reference model was -1.1%. This study demonstrated that the PCT has prognostic value but does not add substantially to a prognostic model for spontaneous pregnancy.},

In women with clomiphene-citrate resistant WHO group II anovulation, one of the treatment options is ovulation induction with exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH or follitropin). FSH is derived from urine or is produced as recombinant FSH. Two forms of recombinant FSH are available - follitropin alpha and follitropin beta. To evaluate the efficacy, safety, costs and acceptability of recombinant FSH, we performed a review to compare recombinant FSH with urinary-derived FSH products. Follitropin alpha, beta and urinary FSH products appeared to be equally effective in terms of pregnancy rates. Patient safety was also found to be comparable, as the incidence of side effects including multiple pregnancies was similar for all FSH products. In practice follitropin alpha and beta may be more convenient to use due to the ease of self-administration, but they are also more expensive than the urinary products.},

In a retrospective study in four large teaching hospitals, all subfertile women who underwent a THL and a conventional laparoscopy as part of their fertility work-up in the period between 2000 and 2011 were studied. Findings at THL were compared with findings at diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopies. Tubal occlusion, endometriosis and adhesions were defined as abnormalities. Out of 1119 women, 1103 women underwent THL. A complete evaluation or incomplete but diagnostic procedure could be performed in 989 (89.7%) and 28 (2.5%), respectively. An incomplete non-diagnostic procedure was performed in 11 (1.0%) women. Failure of THL occurred in 75 women (6.8%) and 40 of these women (3.6%) subsequently underwent laparoscopy. Laparoscopy was performed in a total of 126 patients with a median time interval of 7 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 3-13 weeks). Of 64 patients who successfully underwent both THL and laparoscopy, concordant findings were found in 53 women and discordant results in 11 women, 6 of which were caused by tubal spasm. Sensitivity of THL in detecting abnormalities was 100% and specificity was 22.2%, with a likelihood ratio of 1.29. THL in an outpatient setting can detect anatomical abnormalities comparable to the more invasive reference standard diagnostic laparoscopy. If THL succeeds, there is no need to add a diagnostic laparoscopy in the work-up.},

The primary outcome measure was intrauterine pregnancy, either after natural conception or after treatment with intrauterine insemination or ovulation induction. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and fecundity rate ratios (FRR) were established. THL showed bilateral patent tubes in 83%, one-sided tubal occlusion in 12.4% and bilateral tubal occlusion in 4.6% of women. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates after 36 months were 52% for women with bilateral patent tubes, 44% for one-sided tubal occlusion (FRR 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.39) and 7% for bilateral tubal occlusion (FRR 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.43).

So, in order to minimize invasiveness while optimizing repeatability, we sought to create an easily reproducible single-access port operative strategy. Four patients suffering from intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis for >10 years (12.8 ± 5.9) underwent a single-port unilateral R5-R11 splanchnotomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. No operative complications were observed. All 4 patients experienced excellent pain relief with a significant improvement of Visual Analogue Scale pain scores (8.8 ± 1.0 preoperatively to 3.0 ± 1.2 postoperatively, P = 0.003). We report the first series of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) splanchnotomy for palliation of intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis. From this small study, single-port VATS splanchnotomy seems to be a safe and effective alternative to multiportal or open procedures.},

Plant-based production systems for terpenoids critically depend on the availability of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Currently, these systems show insufficient yields, due to the competition for FPP of newly introduced pathways with endogenous ones. In this study, for the first time an RNAi strategy aiming at silencing of endogenous pathways for increased (+)-valencene production was employed. Firstly, a transient production system for (+)-valencene in Nicotiana benthamiana was set up using agroinfiltration. Secondly, silencing of the endogenous 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS) and squalene synthase (SQS) that compete for the FPP pool was deployed. This resulted in a N. benthamiana plant that produces (+)-valencene as a prevalent volatile with a 2.8-fold increased yield. Finally, the size of the FPP pool was increased by overexpression of enzymes that are rate-limiting in FPP biosynthesis. Combined with silencing of EAS and SQS, no further increase of (+)-valencene production was observed, but emission of farnesol. Formation of farnesol, which is a breakdown product of FPP, indicates that overproducing sesquiterpenes is no longer limited by FPP availability in the cytosol. This study shows that metabolic engineering of plants can effectively be used for increased production of desired products in plants.},

Plant genomes often encode a number of related terpene synthases, which can produce very different terpenes. The relationship between TPS sequence and resulting terpene product is not completely understood. In this work we describe two TPSs from the Camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. One of these, CiCaMS, acts as a monoterpene synthase (monoTPS), and mediates the production of myrcene, while the other, CiCaSSy, acts as a sesquiterpene synthase (sesquiTPS), and catalyses the production of α-santalene, β-santalene and trans-α-bergamotene. Interestingly, these enzymes share 97% DNA sequence identity and differ only in 22 amino acid residues out of 553. To understand which residues are essential for the catalysis of monoterpenes resp. sesquiterpenes, a number of hybrid synthases were prepared, and supplemented by a set of single-residue variants. These were tested for their ability to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes by in vivo production of sesquiterpenes in E. coli, and by in vitro enzyme assays. This analysis pinpointed three residues in the sequence which could mediate the change in product specificity from a monoterpene synthase to a sesquiterpene synthase. Another set of three residues defined the sesquiterpene product profile, including the ratios between sesquiterpene products.},

  abstract = {Most secreted proteins in eukaryotes are modified on the amino acid consensus sequence NxS/T by an N-glycan through the process of N-glycosylation. The N-glycans on glycoproteins are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to different mannose-type N-glycans or, when the protein passes through the Golgi apparatus, to different complex glycan forms. Here we describe the capturing of N-glycopeptides from a trypsin digest of total protein extracts of Arabidopsis plants and release of these captured peptides following Peptide N-glycosidase (PNGase) treatment for analysis of N-glycan site-occupancy. The mixture of peptides released as a consequence of the PNGase treatment was analyzed by two dimensional nano-LC-MS. As the PNGase treatment of glycopeptides results in the deamidation of the asparagine (N) in the NxS/T site of the released peptide, this asparagine (N) to aspartic acid (D) conversion is used as a glycosylation 'signature'. The efficiency of PNGase F and PNGase A in peptide release is discussed. The identification of proteins with a single glycopeptide was limited by the used search algorithm but could be improved using a reference database including deamidated peptide sequences. Additional stringency settings were used for filtering results to minimize false discovery. This resulted in identification of 330 glycopeptides on 173 glycoproteins from Arabidopsis, of which 28 putative glycoproteins, that were previously not annotated as secreted protein in The Arabidopsis Information Resource database (TAIR). Furthermore, the identified glycosylation site occupancy helped to determine the correct topology for membrane proteins. A quantitative comparison of peptide signal was made between wild type and complex-glycan-less (cgl) mutant Arabidopsis from three replicate leaf samples using a label-free MS peak comparison. As an example, the identified membrane protein SKU5 (AT4G12420) showed differential glycopeptide intensity ratios between WT and cgl indicating heterogeneous glycan modification on single protein. Proteins that enter the secretory pathway are mostly modified by N-glycans. The function of N-glycosylation has been well studied in mammals. However, in plants the function of N-glycosylation is still unclear, because glycosylation mutants in plants often do not have a clear phenotype. Here we analyzed which proteins are modified by N-glycans in plants by developing a glycopeptide enrichment method for plant proteins. Subsequently, label free comparative proteomics was employed using protein fractions from wild type and from a mutant which is blocked in modification of the N-glycan into complex glycans. The results provide new information on N-glycosylation sites on numerous secreted proteins. Results allow for specific mapping of multiple glycosylation site occupancy on proteins, which provides information on which glycosylation sites are protected or non-used from downstream processing and thus presumably are buried into the protein structure. Glycoproteomics can therefore contribute to protein structure analysis. Indeed, mapping the glycosylation sites on membrane proteins gives information on the topology of protein folds over the membrane. We thus were able to correct the topology prediction of three membrane proteins. Besides, these studies also identified limitations in the software that is used to identify single modified peptide per protein.

Due to its characteristic scent, it is frequently used in dairy products, tea drinks and fine fragrances. The demand for natural indole by the flavor and fragrance industry is high, yet, its abundance in essential oils isolated from plants such as jasmine and narcissus is low. Thus, there is a strong demand for a sustainable method to produce food-grade indole. Here, we established the biotechnological production of indole upon L-tryptophan supplementation in the bacterial host Corynebacterium glutamicum. Heterologous expression of the tryptophanase gene from E. coli enabled the conversion of supplemented L-tryptophan to indole. Engineering of the substrate import by co-expression of the native aromatic amino acid permease gene aroP increased whole-cell biotransformation of L-tryptophan to indole by two-fold. Indole production to 0.2 g L The bioconversion production process established in this study provides an attractive route for sustainable indole production from tryptophan in C. glutamicum.

Besides, inulin chicory taproots also accumulate sesquiterpene lactones (STLs). These are bitter tasting compounds, which need to be removed during inulin extraction, resulting in additional costs. In this work, we describe chicory lines where STL accumulation is almost completely eliminated. Genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to inactivate four genes that encode the enzyme that performs the first dedicated step in STL synthesis, germacrene A synthase (CiGAS). Chicory lines were obtained that carried null mutations in all four CiGAS genes. Lines lacking functional CiGAS alleles showed a normal phenotype upon greenhouse cultivation and show nearly complete elimination of the STL synthesis in the roots. It was shown that the reduction in STLs could be attributed to mutations in genetically linked copies of the CiGAS-short gene and not the CiGAS-long gene, which is relevant for breeding the trait into other cultivars. The inactivation of the STL biosynthesis pathway led to increase in phenolic compounds as well as accumulation of squalene in the chicory taproot, presumably due to increased availability of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FFP). These results demonstrate that STLs are not essential for chicory growth and that the inhibition of the STL biosynthesis pathway reduced the STL levels chicory which will facilitate inulin extraction.},

  abstract = {The flavour and fragrance compound β-ionone, which naturally occurs in raspberry and many other fruits and flowers, is currently produced by synthetic chemistry. This study describes a synthetic biology approach for β-ionone production from glucose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is partially based on polycistronic expression. Experiments with model proteins showed that the T2A sequence of the Thosea asigna virus mediated efficient production of individual proteins from a single transcript in S. cerevisiae. Subsequently, three β-carotene biosynthesis genes from the carotenoid-producing ascomycete Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (crtI, crtE and crtYB) were expressed in S. cerevisiae from a single polycistronic construct. In this construct, the individual crt proteins were separated by T2A sequences. Production of the individual proteins from the polycistronic construct was confirmed by Western blot analysis and by measuring the production of β-carotene. To enable β-ionone production, a carotenoid-cleavage dioxygenase from raspberry (RiCCD1) was co-expressed in the β-carotene producing strain. In glucose-grown cultures with a second phase of dodecane, β-ionone and geranylacetone accumulated in the organic phase. Thus, by introducing a polycistronic construct encoding a fungal carotenoid pathway and an expression cassette encoding a plant dioxygenase, a novel microbial production system has been established for a fruit flavour compound.},

We here investigate the potential of the mushroom Schizophyllum commune for the production of sesquiterpenes. Genomic analysis of S. commune revealed that the mevalonate pathway required for the synthesis of the farnesyl diphosphate substrate for sesquiterpene production is operational. Introduction of a valencene synthase gene resulted in production of the sesquiterpene (+)-valencene, both in mycelium and in fruiting bodies. Levels of (+)-valencene in culture media of strains containing a mutated RGS regulatory protein gene (thn) were increased fourfold compared to those in wild-type transformants. Up to 16 mg L(-1) (+)-valencene was produced in these strains. In addition, the amount of (+)-valencene containing n-dodecane recovered from the culture medium increased sixfold to sevenfold in the thn mutant strains due to the absence of schizophyllan.},

The cultivation of BY-2 cells in disposable bioreactors is a useful alternative to conventional stainless steel stirred-tank reactors, and orbitally-shaken bioreactors could provide further advantages such as simple bag geometry, scalability and predictable process settings. We carried out a scale-up study, using a 200-L orbitally-shaken bioreactor holding disposable bags, and BY-2 cells producing the human monoclonal antibody M12. We found that cell growth and recombinant protein accumulation were comparable to standard shake flask cultivation, despite a 200-fold difference in cultivation volume. Final cell fresh weights of 300-387 g/L and M12 yields of ∼20 mg/L were achieved with both cultivation methods. Furthermore, we established an efficient downstream process for the recovery of M12 from the culture broth. The viscous spent medium prevented clarification using filtration devices, but we used expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography with SP Sepharose as an alternative for the efficient capture of the M12 antibody. EBA was introduced as an initial purification step prior to protein A affinity chromatography, resulting in an overall M12 recovery of 75-85% and a purity of >95%. Our results demonstrate the suitability of orbitally-shaken bioreactors for the scaled-up cultivation of plant cell suspension cultures and provide a strategy for the efficient purification of antibodies from the BY-2 culture medium.},

We produced IgA1κ and IgG1κ versions of three therapeutic antibodies directed against pro-inflammatory cytokines in Nicotiana benthamiana: Infliximab and Adalimumab, directed against TNF-α, and Ustekinumab, directed against the interleukin-12p40 subunit. We evaluated antibody yield, quality and N-glycosylation. All six antibodies had comparable levels of expression between 3.5 and 9% of total soluble protein content and were shown to have neutralizing activity in a cell-based assay. However, IgA1κ-based Adalimumab and Ustekinumab were poorly secreted compared to their IgG counterparts. Infliximab was poorly secreted regardless of isotype backbone. This corresponded with the observation that both IgA1κ- and IgG1κ-based Infliximab were enriched in oligomannose-type N-glycan structures. For IgG1κ-based Ustekinumab and Adalimumab, the major N-glycan type was the typical plant complex N-glycan, biantennary with terminal N-acetylglucosamine, β1,2-xylose and core α1,3-fucose. In contrast, the major N-glycan on the IgA-based antibodies was xylosylated, but lacked core α1,3-fucose and one terminal N-acetylglucosamine. This type of N-glycan occurs usually in marginal percentages in plants and was never shown to be the main fraction of a plant-produced recombinant protein. Our data demonstrate that the antibody isotype may have a profound influence on the type of N-glycan an antibody receives.},

These small molecules have shown several health benefits for various diseases, including brain disorders. However, it is unknown whether these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and which could be the effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. We show that six sesquiterpene lactones evaluated in an in vitro model of the BBB have different capacities to be transported through the barrier. Costunolide presented more than 20 % of transport while lactucin, 11β-13-dihydrolactucin, 11β-13-dihydrolactucopicrin, and parthenolide presented between 10 % and 20 %, whilst almost no transport was detected for lactucopicrin. Furthermore, costunolide and parthenolide reduced P-gp ABC transporter expression alongside an increase in caveolin-1, the main protein of caveolae. Remarkably, these two compounds improved barrier tightness by increasing the expression of both tight and adherens junctions. These findings open a new avenue to explore costunolide and parthenolide as promising compounds for brain therapies.},

In this study we introduced Rosea1 (ROS1, a MYB type) and Delila (DEL, a bHLH type), into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration. ROS1 and DEL form a pair of well-characterized TFs from Snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), which specifically induce anthocyanin accumulation when expressed in tomato fruit. In N. benthamiana, robust induction of a single anthocyanin, delphinidin-3-rutinoside (D3R) was observed after expression of both ROS1 and DEL. Surprisingly in addition to D3R, a range of additional metabolites were also strongly and specifically up-regulated upon expression of ROS1 and DEL. Except for the D3R, these induced compounds were not derived from the flavonoid pathway. Most notable among these are nornicotine conjugates with butanoyl, hexanoyl, and octanoyl hydrophobic moieties, and phenylpropanoid-polyamine conjugates such as caffeoyl putrescine. The defensive properties of the induced molecules were addressed in bioassays using the tobacco specialist lepidopteran insect Manduca sexta. Our study showed that the effect of ROS1 and DEL expression in N. benthamiana leaves extends beyond the flavonoid pathway. Apparently the same transcription factor may regulate different secondary metabolite pathways in different plant species.},

The antibody yield was enhanced 30-fold by the addition of 14 g/L KNO3 , 19 mg/L 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 1.5 g/L of the stabilizing agent polyvinylpyrrolidone. Analysis of hairy root cross sections revealed that the optimized medium induced lateral root formation and morphological changes in the inner cortex and pericycle cells, indicating that the improved productivity was at least partially based on the enhanced efficiency of antibody secretion. We found that 57% of the antibody was secreted, yielding 5.9 mg of product per liter of induction medium. Both the secreted and intracellular forms of the antibody could be isolated by protein A affinity chromatography and their functionality was confirmed using vitronectin-binding assays. Glycan analysis revealed three major plant complex-type glycans on both forms of the antibody, although the secreted form was more homogeneous due to the predominance of a specific glycoform. Tobacco hairy root cultures therefore offer a practical solution for the production of homogeneous pharmaceutical antibodies in containment.},

It is an oxidized sesquiterpene, which has been postulated to be derived from valencene. Both valencene and nootkatone are used for flavouring citrus beverages and are considered among the most valuable terpenes used at commercial scale. Functional evaluation of putative terpene synthase genes sourced by large-scale EST sequencing from Nootka cypress wood revealed a valencene synthase gene (CnVS). CnVS expression in different tissues from the tree correlates well with nootkatone content, suggesting that CnVS represents the first dedicated gene in the nootkatone biosynthetic pathway in C. nootkatensis The gene belongs to the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily of terpenes synthases and its protein sequence has low similarity to known citrus valencene synthases. In vitro, CnVS displays high robustness under different pH and temperature regimes, potentially beneficial properties for application in different host and physiological conditions. Biotechnological production of sesquiterpenes has been shown to be feasible, but productivity of microbial strains expressing valencene synthase from Citrus is low, indicating that optimization of valencene synthase activity is needed. Indeed, expression of CnVS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated potential for higher yields. In an optimized Rhodobacter sphaeroides strain, expression of CnVS increased valencene yields 14-fold to 352 mg/L, bringing production to levels with industrial potential.},

Here we show that these differences are associated with differences at its N-terminus: the natural short variant of human GalT results in hybrid type N-glycans, whereas the long form generates bi-antennary complex type N-glycans. Furthermore, expression of non-mammalian, chicken and zebrafish GalT homologues with N-termini resembling the short human GalT N-terminus also induce hybrid type N-glycans. Providing both non-mammalian GalTs with a 13 amino acid N-terminal extension that distinguishes the two naturally occurring forms of human GalT, acted to increase the levels of bi-antennary galactosylated N-glycans when expressed in tobacco leaves. Replacement of the cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain of chicken and zebrafish GalTs with the corresponding region of rat α2,6-sialyltransferase yielded a gene whose expression enhanced the level of bi-antennary galactosylation even further.},

  abstract = {Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome due to defective DNA inter-strand cross-link repair. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative for pancytopenia, but may not prevent the development of non-hematological malignancies. We describe a 26-year-old male patient with FA and Marfan syndrome who in 1994 underwent successful HSCT with bone marrow stem cells from his human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sister. In 2006, three lesions in the liver were detected and resected. The three lesions all showed activation of the β-catenin pathway and were histologically characterized by a highly differentiated steatotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with remnants of the underlying adenoma from which it arose, a hepatocellular adenoma with foci of well-differentiated HCC, and a cholestatic adenoma. Risk factors for the emergence of HCC included FA itself, the use of androgens for a period of 3 years preceding HSCT and toxicity of the conditioning regimen. Because of the danger of developing additional HCC, liver transplantation was proposed, taking into consideration that immunosuppression would increase the risk of other malignancies. By using part of the liver of the sister, who already acted as bone marrow donor 13 years earlier, immunosuppression could be avoided. Liver transplantation was performed in 2007 without complication. Five years after liver transplantation the patient is doing well. This case is twofold special being the first case reporting FA co-occurring with Marfan syndrome and being the first reported case of FA treated for HCC by liver transplantation from a HLA-identical sibling donor without the use of immunosuppression.},

  abstract = {Continuous administration of inhaled nitric oxide is now widely used as a potent and selective pulmonary vasodilator. We have evaluated the effects of IV dipyridamole, a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitor, on the magnitude and duration of action of inhaled nitric oxide (NO)-mediated pulmonary vasodilation. We hypothesized that inhibition of cGMP degradation could augment and prolong the pulmonary vasodilating effects of NO and allow for intermittent NO inhalation. In eight anesthetized and mechanically ventilated piglets, IV U-46619, a thromboxane A(2) analog, was used to induce pulmonary hypertension. The effects of 2, 5, and 10 ppm of NO, delivered during 4 min for each concentration and followed by a 10-min NO-free interval after each NO concentration, were evaluated without and with dipyridamole. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 825 +/- 49 dynes. s. cm(-5) (U-46619) to 533 +/- 48 dynes. s. cm(-5) (10 ppm NO) (P < 0.05 versus U-46619) and 396 +/- 42 dynes. s. cm(-5) (dipyridamole 10 microg kg-1x min-1 and 10 ppm NO) (P <0.05 versus NO), and cardiac output increased from 1.93 +/- 0.09 L/min to 2.03 +/- 0.13 L/min and 2.60 +/- 0.30 L/min (P < 0.05 versus NO). Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 90 +/- 5 mm Hg (10 ppm NO) to 75 +/- 3 mm Hg (dipyridamole plus 10 ppm NO) (P < 0.01). The pulmonary vasodilation obtained with NO alone could be prolonged from 12 to 42 min when inhaled NO was combined with IV dipyridamole, accounting for a time-weighted reduction in NO exposure by 72%. We conclude that dipyridamole augments the effects of NO on right ventricular afterload, allows for intermittent NO inhalation, and can significantly reduce exposure to NO. IV dipyridamole prolongs the action of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in a piglet model of acute pulmonary hypertension. Intermittent NO inhalation combined with IV dipyridamole decreases pulmonary artery pressure for a prolonged period of time and reduces exposure to NO.},

Although previous studies recommend aggressive parenteral prostacyclin therapy (epoprostenol), we describe the opportunity to treat cases of severe POPH with an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (sildenafil) and/or an endothelin receptor antagonist (bosentan/ambrisentan) as a bridge to successful LTx in selected patients.},

We investigated whether i.v. dipyridamole, a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, increased the effects of inhaled NO and prevented rebound pulmonary hypertension. In 14 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated piglets, pulmonary hypertension was induced with U-46619, a thromboxane A(2) analogue. Response to NO and rebound pulmonary hypertension were evaluated without and with i.v. dipyridamole. Low-dose dipyridamole (10 micro g/kg/min) increased cardiac output and augmented the effects of inhaled NO on pulmonary vascular resistance, with marginal additive effect on mean pulmonary artery pressure. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 904 to 511 (20 parts per million NO) (p < 0.0005) and 358 dyne s cm(-5) (20 parts per million NO + dipyridamole) (p < 0.001 versus NO alone), and mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 29.0 to 20.5 (p < 0.0001) and 19.3 mm Hg (NS versus NO), respectively. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 85 to 74 mm Hg (dipyridamole + NO) (p < 0.01). High-dose dipyridamole (100 micro g/kg/min) with inhaled NO reduced pulmonary vascular resistance to 334 dyne s cm(-5) but also decreased mean arterial pressure to 57 mm Hg. Eight piglets developed rebound pulmonary hypertension. Two died of acute right ventricular failure and, in five, rebound pulmonary hypertension was prevented by low-dose dipyridamole. In conclusion, low-dose i.v. dipyridamole augments the effects of inhaled NO on right ventricular afterload with moderate changes in systemic hemodynamics, and can prevent rebound pulmonary hypertension.},

  abstract = {Critically ill cirrhotic patients are increasingly transplanted, but there is no consensus about futile liver transplantation (LT). Therefore, the decision to delay or deny LT is often extensively debated. These debates arise from different opinions of futility among transplant team members. This study aims to achieve a multinational and multidisciplinary consensus on the definition of futility in LT and to develop well-articulated criteria for not proceeding with LT due to futility. Thirty-five international experts from anesthesiology/intensive care, hepatology, and transplant surgery were surveyed using the Delphi method. More than 70% of similar answers to a question were necessary to define agreement. The panel recommended patient and graft survival at 1 year after LT to define futility. Severe frailty and persistent fever or <72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy in case of ongoing sepsis were considered reasons to delay LT. A simple assessment of the number of organs failing was considered the most appropriate way to decide whether LT should be delayed or denied, with respiratory, circulatory and metabolic failures having the most influence in this decision. The thresholds of severity of organ failures contraindicating LT for which a consensus was achieved were a Pao2/FiO2 ratio<150 mm Hg, a norepinephrine dose >1 μg/kg per minute and a serum lactate level >9 mmol/L. Our expert panel provides a consensus on the definition of futile LT and on specific criteria for postponing or denying LT. A framework that may facilitate the decision if a patient is too sick for transplant is presented.},

An e-Delphi method was used with an extended interdisciplinary panel of experts to validate the final recommendations. Forty-three articles were included in the systematic review. A consensus was reached among experts after the second round. Patients should be screened for malnutrition and treated whenever possible. Prophylactic nasogastric intubation and prophylactic abdominal drainage may be omitted, and early extubation should be considered. Early oral intake, mobilization, and multimodal-balanced analgesia are recommended. The current ERAS recommendations were elaborated based on the best available evidence and endorsed by the e-Delphi method.

The Liver Intensive Care Group of Europe nominated a panel of recognized international experts who reviewed the available literature published from 1990 to January 2016 and produced clinical recommendations. The level of evidence and strength of recommendation were judged according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation system. Diagnosis of AKI should be based on the KDIGO criteria. The preoperative risk factors are more related to the patient's predisposing factors and post-operative risk factors tend to be difficult to control. Therefore, focusing on intra-operative risk factors it would be important to maintain an adequate hemodynamics and to keep inferior vena cava clamping as short as possible. Biomarkers to identify AKI at an early stage are available; however, there is a lack of robust data that indicates their true beneficial effect. Intraoperative renal replacement therapy may be beneficial in some selective cases whereas its postoperative timing is still under debate. Perioperative liver transplant risk factors for acute kidney injury are difficult to control. Therefore, the focus should be on intra-operative hemodynamics and nephrotoxic drugs avoidance. Prospective randomized trials are needed to show the beneficial effect of early replacement therapy. In this context, the new biomarkers would be helpful in identifying kidney injury earlier.},

The overall conversion rate was 17/265 (6.4%), equally distributed over the period of the study. Statistically significant factors for conversion were found to be LLR of the postero-superior (P-S) segments (SI, SIVa; SVII; SVIII) (12.7% converted versus 2.5% non-converted groups, P = 0.01) and a major compared with a minor hepatectomy (15.2% vs. 4.6%, P = 0.02 respectively). A R0 resection was achieved in 93.2% of cases. According to Dindo's classification, complications were recorded as grade I (n = 20); grade II (6); grade III (11) and grade IV(1) events (total morbidity rate of 14%). Univariate analysis identified a major hepatectomy and resection involving P-S segments as prognostic factors for conversion whereas multivariate analysis identified the latter as an independent risk factor [P = 0.003, odds ratio (OR) = 5.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-18.8]. LLR can be safely performed with low overall morbidity. According to this experience and irrespective of the learning curve, resections of P-S segments were identified as an independent risk factor for conversion in LLR.},

We demonstrated in the past that volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver resection. In this randomized study, we examined if volatile anesthetics have an effect on acute graft injury and clinical outcomes after liver transplantation. Cadaveric liver transplant recipients were enrolled from January 2009 to September 2012 at 3 University Centers (Zurich/Sao Paulo/Ghent). Recipients were randomly assigned to propofol (control group) or sevoflurane anesthesia. Postoperative peak of aspartate transaminase was defined as primary endpoint, secondary endpoints were early allograft dysfunction, in-hospital complications, intensive care unit, and hospital stay. Ninety-eight recipients were randomized to propofol (n = 48) or sevoflurane (n = 50). Median peak aspartate transaminase after transplantation was 925 (interquartile range, 512-3274) in the propofol and 1097 (interquartile range, 540-2633) in the sevoflurane group. In the propofol arm, 11 patients (23%) experienced early allograft dysfunction, 7 (14%) in the sevoflurane one (odds ratio, 0.64 (0.20 to 2.02, P = 0.45). There were 4 mortalities (8.3%) in the propofol and 2 (4.0%) in the sevoflurane group. Overall and major complication rates were not different. An effect on clinical outcomes was observed favoring the sevoflurane group (less severe complications), but without significance. This first multicenter trial comparing propofol with sevoflurane anesthesia in liver transplantation shows no difference in biochemical markers of acute organ injury and clinical outcomes between the 2 regimens. Sevoflurane has no significant added beneficial effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury compared to propofol.},

Because POPH is frequently asymptomatic, screening with echocardiography is recommended. The only reliable technique, however, for diagnosing POPH is right heart catheterization (RHC). The aims of this study were to evaluate the current estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) cutoff value of 30 mm Hg and to determine a better cutoff value. One hundred fifty-two patients underwent pretransplant echocardiography between January 2005 and December 2010. These echocardiographic results were compared with pulmonary artery pressures measured during the pretransplant workup or at the beginning of the transplantation procedure (both by catheterization). With a cutoff value of 30 mm Hg, 74 of the 152 patients met the criteria for POPH on echocardiography, although the diagnosis was confirmed in only 7 patients during catheterization; this resulted in a specificity of 54%. It would have been more accurate to use a cutoff value of 38 mm Hg, which had a maximal specificity of 82% and, at the same time, guaranteed a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%. With the incorporation of the presence or absence of right ventricular dilatation, the specificity even increased to 93% for this new cutoff value. In conclusion, the prevalence of POPH was 4.6% among LT candidates in this study. We can recommend that LT candidates with an sPAP > 38 mm Hg should be referred for RHC. With the cutoff value increased from 30 to 38 mm Hg, the number of patients undergoing invasive RHC during their evaluation could be safely reduced.},

During an 18-month period, all adult patients that needed treatment for a unilateral inguinal or femoral hernia were treated by the TIPP repair using the Polysoft mesh. This group was retrospectively compared with a historical cohort of patients treated by the Lichtenstein technique. Our policy concerning type of anaesthesia, post-operative pain management and visual analogue scale measurements did not change over the study period. For post-operative pain evaluation, the visual analogue scale was used (0-10) and scores were measured after 6 h, 24 h, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year and yearly thereafter. Recurrence rates were evaluated at time of clinical examinations. In total, 142 patients have been analysed with the TIPP technique (group I) versus 136 patients operated in the previous 2 years with a Lichtenstein repair (group II). In group I, 112 patients (78.9%) received a medium size patch of 14 x 7.5 cm and 30 patients (21.1%) had a large patch (16 x 9 cm). The mean operative time for a TIPP procedure was statistically shorter than for a Lichtenstein repair, 33 versus 44 min, respectively (p = 0.04). After 24 h, 1 week and 1 month post-surgery, there was significantly less post-operative pain observed in the TIPP group than in the Lichtenstein group. In total, four recurrences were observed in the TIPP group (2.8%), of which one laterally and three medially. In group II, seven recurrences were observed in total (5.1%), of which five were detected within 2 years of follow-up (3.7%). For surgeons performing the Lichtenstein repair but looking for modifications concerning pain relief and a quicker procedure, the TIPP approach is a feasible alternative that seems to be associated with less post-operative pain.},

Uniquely, three well-defined morphologies of the lipoplex were observed upon gradual acidification: a lamellar phase, a condensed lamellar phase, and an inverted hexagonal (H(II)) columnar phase. Using molecular modeling, we link the observed lipoplex morphologies and physical behavior to specific structural features in the individual surfactant, illuminating key factors in future surfactant design, viz., a spacer of six methylene groups, the presence of two nitrogens that can be protonated in the physiological pH range, two unsaturated alkyl tails, and hydrophilic sugar headgroups. Assuming that the mechanism of transfection by synthetic cationic surfactants involves endocytosis, we contend that the efficacy of gemini surfactant 1 as a gene delivery vehicle can be explained by the unprecedented observation of a pH-induced formation of the inverted hexagonal phase of the lipoplex in the endosomal pH range. This change in morphology leads to destabilization of the endosome through fusion of the lipoplex with the endosomal wall, resulting in release of DNA into the cytoplasm.},

  abstract = {There is generally limited but conflicting literature on the incidence, causes, and outcomes of pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This study was performed to determine the incidence and outcome of pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest reported by all helicopter emergency medical services in the Netherlands and to provide a description of causes and treatments and, in particular, a description of the specific interventions that can be performed by a physician-staffed helicopter emergency medical service. A retrospective analysis was performed of all documented pediatric (0 < 18 years of age) out-of-hospital cardiac arrests from July 2015 to July 2017, attended by all 4 Dutch helicopter emergency medical service teams. Two hundred two out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were identified. The overall incidence in the Netherlands is 3.5 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in children per 100,000 pediatric inhabitants. The overall survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was 11.4%. Eleven (52%) of the survivors were in the drowning group and between 12 and 96 months of age. Helicopter emergency medical services are frequently called to pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrests in the Netherlands. The survival rate is normal to high compared with other countries. The 12- to 96-month age group and drowning seem to have a relatively favorable outcome.},

  abstract = {Surgery for refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal hernia leads to recurrence or persisting dysphagia in a minority of patients. Redo antireflux surgery in GERD and hiatal hernia is known for higher morbidity and mortality. This study aims to evaluate conventional versus robot-assisted laparoscopic redo antireflux surgery, with the objective to detect possible advantages for the robot-assisted approach. A single institute cohort of 75 patients who underwent either conventional laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic redo surgery for recurrent GERD or severe dysphagia between 2008 and 2013 were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, medical history, procedural data, hospital stay, complications and outcome were prospectively gathered. The main indications for redo surgery were dysphagia, pyrosis or a combination of both in combination with a proven anatomic abnormality. The mean time to redo surgery was 1.9 and 2.0 years after primary surgery for the conventional and robot-assisted groups, respectively. The number of conversions was lower in the robot-assisted group compared to conventional laparoscopy (1/45 vs. 5/30, p = 0.035) despite a higher proportion of patients with previous surgery by laparotomy (9/45 vs. 1/30, p = 0.038). Median hospital stay was reduced by 1 day (3 vs. 4, p = 0.042). There were no differences in mortality, complications or outcome. Robotic support, when available, can be regarded beneficial in redo surgery for GERD and hiatal hernia. Results of this observational study suggest technical feasibility for minimal-invasive robot-assisted redo surgery after open primary antireflux surgery, a reduced number of conversions and shorter hospital stay.},

  abstract = {Microcirculatory alterations have been associated with morbidity and mortality in human sepsis. Such alterations occur despite pressure-guided resuscitation. Earlier data suggested that impaired microcirculatory blood flow could be corrected with intravenous nitroglycerin in these patients. We tested this concept after fulfillment of preset systemic hemodynamic resuscitation end points in the early phase of sepsis. Prospective, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Closed-format 22-bed mixed intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients > or =18 yrs with sepsis, according to international criteria, and at least one early sign of organ dysfunction, as the principal reason for intensive care unit admission, were eligible for enrollment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive nitroglycerin (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35) after fulfillment of protocol-driven resuscitation end points. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00493415. Primary outcome was sublingual microcirculatory blood flow of small vessels, as assessed by side-stream dark field imaging. After protocolized resuscitation, we observed recruitment of sublingual microcirculation in both groups, as indicated by a significant improvement in the microcirculatory flow index after 24 hrs, in comparison to baseline. However, no difference in the sublingual microvascular flow index was observed between groups. The median microvascular flow index in sublingual small-sized vessels was 2.71 (1.85-3) in the nitroglycerin group and 2.71 (1.27-3), p = .80, in the placebo group. In medium-sized vessels, the respective values were 3 (2.75-3) vs. 2.86 (2.19-3), p = .21, and in large-sized vessels, 3 (3-3) vs. 3 (2.89-3), p = .06. In-hospital mortality, as a secondary outcome, was 34.3% in the nitroglycerin group and 14.2% in the placebo group, p = .09. In the context of a strict resuscitation protocol, based upon fulfillment of systemic hemodynamic end points in patients with early-phase severe sepsis or septic shock, we conclude that intravenous nitroglycerin does not promote sublingual microcirculatory blood flow.},

  abstract = {The use of regional anaesthesia has increased and evolved over the past two decades but to what extent is unclear. Moreover, there is no clear standardisation of best practice in the current European landscape, which could result in inconsistencies in regional anaesthesia in practice. The objective of this survey was to explore regional anaesthesia practices across Europe, including the differences in procedures, use of ultrasound, reporting of complications, guidelines, training and patient safety implementation. A Faculty of European regional anaesthesia experts developed a survey of 27 questions focused on respondent and institution profile, anaesthesia services, patient and safety management, training, use of guidelines, and the implementation of NRFit The survey was disseminated across several European countries via professional networks. There were 794 respondents from 36 European countries. The survey demonstrated that use of regional anaesthesia is growing in Europe and is supported by new technologies. Although some results are consistent with expected trends and applications (e.g. procedures predominantly performed by anaesthesiologists), there are inconsistencies in practice across European countries, especially in the specific regional anaesthesia procedures utilised for different clinical applications and the recording and reporting of regional anaesthesia complications. These inconsistencies also extended to which guidelines are primarily followed and how training is implemented. There were also variations in the general awareness and uptake of the ISO standard for NRFit. The survey results highlight a clear need for standardisation and consistency in the use and management of regional anaesthesia across Europe. The faculty put forth several calls to action that could provide major steps in the right direction towards meeting that goal, including the establishment of European best practices, development of a complication reporting system and implementation of educational programmes to highlight the importance of NRFit.},

  abstract = {Ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is inevitable in kidney transplantation and negatively affects patient and graft outcomes. Anaesthetic conditioning (AC) refers to the use of anaesthetic agents to mitigate IRI. AC is particularly associated with volatile anaesthetic (VA) agents and to a lesser extent to intravenous agents like propofol. VA like sevoflurane interferes with many of the processes underlying IRI and exerts renal protective properties in various models of injury and inflammation. We hypothesise that a sevoflurane-based anaesthesia is able to induce AC and thereby reduce post-transplant renal injury, reflected in improved graft and patient outcome, compared with a propofol-based anaesthesia in transplant recipients of a deceased donor kidney. Investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomised, controlled and prospective clinical trial with two parallel groups. The study will include 488 kidney transplant recipients from donation after brain death (DBD) or donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors. Participants are randomised in a 1:1 design to a sevoflurane (intervention) or propofol (control) group. The primary endpoint is the incidence of delayed graft function in recipients of DCD and DBD donor kidneys and/or 1-year biopsy-proven and treated acute rejection. Secondary endpoints include functional delayed graft function defined as failure of serum creatinine levels to decrease by at least 10% per day for three consecutive days; primary non-function is defined as a permanent lack of function of the allograft; length of hospital stay and postoperative complications of all kinds, estimated glomerular filtration rate at 1 week and 3 and 12 months calculated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula; readmissions at 3 and 12 months, graft survival and all-cause mortality at 12 months. The study is approved by the local ethical committees and national data security agencies. Results are expected to be published in 2025. NCT02727296.},

Wearable sensors are an example of such technology that could decrease workload, enable early detection of patient deterioration, and support clinical decision making by healthcare professionals. These sensors unlock continuous monitoring of vital signs, such as heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen saturation, temperature, and physical activity. However, broad and successful application of wearable sensors on the surgical ward is currently lacking. This may be related to the complexity, especially when it comes to replacing manual measurements by healthcare professionals. This report provides practical guidance to support peers before starting with the clinical application of wearable sensors in the surgical ward. For this purpose, the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework of technology adoption and innovations in healthcare organizations is used, combining existing literature and our own experience in this field over the past years. Specifically, the relevant topics are discussed per domain, and key lessons are subsequently summarized.},

We included all consecutive patients with a confirmed pre- or postoperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive status (operated in 27 hospitals) and negative control patients (operated in 4 hospitals) undergoing emergency or elective operations. A propensity score-matched comparison of clinical outcomes was performed between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive and negative tested patients (control group). Primary outcome was overall 30-day mortality rate between both groups. Main secondary outcomes were overall, pulmonary, and thromboembolic complications. In total, 161 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive and 342 control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 negative patients were included in this study. The 30-day overall postoperative mortality rate was greater in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive cohort compared with the negative control group (16% vs 4% respectively; P = .007). After propensity score matching, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive group consisted of 123 patients (median 70 years of age [interquartile range 59-77] and 55% male) were compared with 196 patients in the matched control group (median 69 years (interquartile range 58-75] and 53% male). The 30-day mortality rate and risk were greater in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive group compared with the matched control group (12% vs 4%; P = .009 and odds ratio 3.4 [95% confidence interval 1.5-8.5]; P = .005, respectively). Overall, pulmonary and thromboembolic complications occurred more often in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients (P < .01). Patients diagnosed with perioperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have an increased risk of 30-day mortality, pulmonary complications, and thromboembolic events. These findings serve as an evidence-based argument to postpone elective surgery and selected emergency cases.},

  abstract = {Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models are used to predict and explore drug infusion schemes and their resulting concentration profiles for clinical application. Our aim was to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for remifentanil that is accurate in patients with a wide range of age and weight. Remifentanil pharmacokinetic data were obtained from three previously published studies of adults and children, one of which also contained pharmacodynamic data from adults. NONMEM was used to estimate allometrically scaled compartmental pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models. Weight, age, height, sex, and body mass index were explored as covariates. Predictive performance was measured across young children, children, young adults, middle-aged, and elderly. Overall, 2,634 remifentanil arterial concentration and 3,989 spectral-edge frequency observations from 131 individuals (55 male, 76 female) were analyzed. Age range was 5 days to 85 yr, weight range was 2.5 to 106 kg, and height range was 49 to 193 cm. The final pharmacokinetic model uses age, weight, and sex as covariates. Parameter estimates for a 35-yr-old, 70-kg male (reference individual) are: V1, 5.81 l; V2, 8.82 l; V3, 5.03 l; CL, 2.58 l/min; Q2, 1.72 l/min; and Q3, 0.124 l/min. Parameters mostly increased with fat-free mass and decreased with age. The pharmacodynamic model effect compartment rate constant (ke0) was 1.09 per minute (reference individual), which decreased with age. We developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to predict remifentanil concentration and effect for a wide range of patient ages and weights. Performance exceeded the Minto model over a wide age and weight range.},

This review gives an update of the actual status of target-controlled infusion (TCI) and closed-loop computer-controlled drug administration and the ongoing research in the field. TCI is becoming mature technology clinically used in many countries nowadays with proven safety. Nevertheless, changing populations might require adapting the established PK/PD models. As TCI requires accurate PK/PD models, new models have been developed which should now be incorporated into the pumps to allow more general use of this technology. Closed-loop administration of hypnotic drugs using an electro-encephalographic-derived-controlled variable has been well studied and has been shown to outperform manual administration. Computer administration for other drugs and fluids have been studied recently. Feasibility has been shown for systems controlling multiple components of anaesthesia, but more work is required to show clinical safety and efficiency. Evidence in the literature is increasing that TCI and closed-loop technology could assist the anaesthetists to optimize drug administration during anaesthesia.},

  abstract = {Induction of anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil often induces unwanted bradycardia and hypotension, raising concerns regarding tissue oxygenation. The electrophysiological cardiac effects of remifentanil can be reversed by atropine. To investigate if prophylactic administration of atropine can attenuate the negative haemodynamic effects of propofol and a high dose of remifentanil during induction of anaesthesia. A double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Single-centre, University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands. Sixty euvolaemic patients scheduled for surgery under general anaesthesia. Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with a target-controlled infusion of propofol with a target effect-site concentration (Ce) of 2.5 μg ml, remifentanil (target-controlled infusion), (Ce 8 ng ml) and cis-atracurium. Methylatropine (500 μg) or 0.9% saline was administered at immediately before induction of anaesthesia. The changes (Δ) in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), rate pressure product, cerebral tissue oxygenation and peripheral tissue oxygenation between induction of anaesthesia (T0) and 10 min later (T10). Atropine significantly attenuated the changes in the outcome measures between T0 and T10. Median (inter-quartile range) changes were MAP, Δ = -24 (-40 to -21) vs. Δ = -37 mmHg (-41 to -31) (P = 0.02); HR, Δ = 0 ± 13 vs. -19 ± 11 bpm (P < 0.01); CI, Δ = -0.4 ± 0.7 vs. -0.9 ± 0.6l min m (P < 0.01) and rate pressure product, Δ = -3241 (-5015 to -613) vs. Δ = -5712 mmHg min (-6715 to -3917) (P < 0.01). Cerebral tissue oxygenation and peripheral tissue oxygenation did not change in either group. Maximum HR after atropine was 102 (86 to 116) vs. 85 bpm (76 to 95). Administration of atropine, before induction of anaesthesia with propofol and high-dose remifentanil, can significantly reduce the decreases in HR, MAP and CI.

  abstract = {Neural mass model-based tracking of brain states from electroencephalographic signals holds the promise of simultaneously tracking brain states while inferring underlying physiological changes in various neuroscientific and clinical applications. Here, neural mass model-based tracking of brain states using the unscented Kalman filter applied to estimate parameters of the Jansen-Rit cortical population model is evaluated through the application of propofol-based anesthetic state monitoring. In particular, 15 subjects underwent propofol anesthesia induction from awake to anesthetised while behavioral responsiveness was monitored and frontal electroencephalographic signals were recorded. The unscented Kalman filter Jansen-Rit model approach applied to frontal electroencephalography achieved reasonable testing performance for classification of the anesthetic brain state (sensitivity: 0.51; chance sensitivity: 0.17; nearest neighbor sensitivity 0.75) when compared to approaches based on linear (autoregressive moving average) modeling (sensitivity 0.58; nearest neighbor sensitivity: 0.91) and a high performing standard depth of anesthesia monitoring measure, Higuchi Fractal Dimension (sensitivity: 0.50; nearest neighbor sensitivity: 0.88). Moreover, it was found that the unscented Kalman filter based parameter estimates of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential amplitude varied in the physiologically expected direction with increases in propofol concentration, while the estimates of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential rate constant did not. These results combined with analysis of monotonicity of parameter estimates, error analysis of parameter estimates, and observability analysis of the Jansen-Rit model, along with considerations of extensions of the Jansen-Rit model, suggests that the Jansen-Rit model combined with unscented Kalman filtering provides a valuable reference point for future real-time brain state tracking studies. This is especially true for studies of more complex, but still computationally efficient, neural models of anesthesia that can more accurately track the anesthetic brain state, while simultaneously inferring underlying physiological changes that can potentially provide useful clinical information.},

In 163 patients, propofol was administered using a CL system (BIS target [BISTARGET] between 40 and 50). Initial CeREMI targets between 2 and 7.5 ng/mL were selected as deemed clinically required. Performance parameters during induction were the time required to initially cross the target BIS, the time required to reach the maximal drug effect after induction (TPEAK, BIS) and the corresponding BIS at this moment, and the time required to regain the target BIS at the end of induction. Performance during maintenance was defined as the percentage of case time with target BIS ± 10 from target and the amount of performance error (PE) between the observed and target BIS values and its derived median PE (MDPE) as a measure of control bias, median absolute PE (MDAPE) as a measure of control inaccuracy, divergence as a measure of the time-related trend of the measured BIS values relative to the target BIS values, and wobble as a measure of intrasubject variability in prediction error. The secondary end point was the hemodynamic stability of the patient during CL control. The applied CL system induced and maintained anesthesia within clinically accepted ranges. The percentage of case time [mean (standard deviation [SD]) across all study participants] with BIS ± 10 from the target was 82% (14%). The mean (SD) population MDPE and MDAPE were -6.6% (5.5%) and 11.2% (5.5%), respectively. A negative divergence [-0.001 (0.004)] and acceptable wobble [9.7% (4.0%)] were found. The correlation between the system PE and CeREMI was low and only influenced by a CeREMI <2.8 ng/mL. Hemodynamic stability stayed within the clinically acceptable range. The applied CL system for propofol administration has an acceptable performance in the CeREMI range of 2.8-7.5 ng/mL during the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. There was no evidence of a strong association between CeREM and the CL performance. This study also shows that when the CeREMI is <2.8 ng/mL, it might be more challenging to prevent arousal during propofol anesthesia.},

Understanding the EMS care process' structure could help identify and address issues that interfere with clinical reasoning. The EMS care process is complex and only basically described. In this research, we aimed to define the different phases of the process and develop an overarching model that can help detect and correct potential error sources, improve clinical reasoning and optimize patient care. We conducted a focused ethnography study utilizing non-participant video observations of real-life EMS deployments combined with thematic analysis of peer interviews. After an initial qualitative analysis of 7 video observations, we formulated a tentative conceptual model of the EMS care process. To test and refine this model, we carried out a qualitative, thematic analysis of 28 video-recorded cases. We validated the resulting model by evaluating its recognizability with a peer content analysis utilizing semi-structured interviews. Based on real-life observations, we were able to define and validate a model covering the distinct phases of an EMS deployment. We have introduced the acronym "SPART" to describe ten different phases: Start, Situation, Prologue, Presentation, Anamnesis, Assessment, Reasoning, Resolution, Treatment, and Transfer. The "SPART" model describes the EMS care process and helps to understand it. We expect it to facilitate identifying and addressing factors that influence both the care process and the clinical reasoning task embedded in this process.},

This dual-centre, prospective, observational study assesses whether the availability of SmartPilot® View alters the behaviour of anaesthetic drug titration of anaesthetists and improves the Anaesthesia Quality Score (AQS; percentage of time spent with MAP 60-80 mm Hg and Bispectral Index [BIS] 40-60 [blinded]). We recruited 493 patients scheduled for elective surgery in two university centres. A control group (CONTROL; n=170) was enrolled to observe drug titration in current practice. Thereafter, an intervention group was enrolled, for which SmartPilot® View was made available to optimise drug titration (SPV; n=188). The AQS, haemodynamic and hypnotic effects, recovery times, pain scores, and other parameters were compared between groups. There were 358 patients eligible for analysis. Anaesthesia quality score was similar between CONTROL and SPV (median AQS [Q1-Q3]) 25.3% [7.4-41.5%] and 22.2% [8.0-44.4%], respectively; P=0.898). Compared with CONTROL, SPV patients had less severe hypotension and hypertension, less BIS <40, faster tracheal extubation, and lower early postoperative pain scores. Adding SmartPilot® View information did not affect average drug titration behaviour. However, small improvements in control of MAP and BIS and early recovery suggest improved titration for some patients without increasing the risk of overdosing or underdosing. NCT01467167.},

Observational trial. Tertiary Belgian hospital, from August 2020 up to September 2021. Seventy-four patients undergoing general anaesthesia for elective surgery requiring the administration of rocuronium and subject to continuous EMG neuromuscular monitoring were included. PK/PD-simulated TOF ratios were plotted and synchronised with their measured electromyographic counterparts and their differences analysed by means of Predictive Error derivatives (Varvel criteria). Published rocuronium PK/PD models overestimated clinically registered TOF ratios. The models of Wierda, Szenohradszky, Cooper, Alvarez-Gomez and McCoy showed significant predictive consistency between themselves, displaying Median Absolute Performance Errors between 38% and 41%, and intra-individual differences (Wobble) between 14 and 15%. The Kleijn model outperformed the former with a lower Median Absolute Performance Error (16%, 95%CI [0.01; 57]) and Wobble (11%, 95%CI [0.01; 34]). All models displayed considerably wide 95% confidence intervals for all performance metrics, suggesting a significantly variable performance. Simulated TOF ratios based on published PK/PD models do not accurately predict real intraoperative TOF ratio dynamics. NCT04518761 (clinicaltrials.gov), registered on 19 August 2020.},

  abstract = {The quality of care given by EMS staff is in part monitored by routine review of deployment reports that the providers must complete after each deployment. The assessment consists of determining whether a deployment was performed in a medically correct manner and thus whether the clinical reasoning process was appropriate. The time used during the deployment is also measured, as there are often time limits for performing different parts of the deployment and these must be adhered to. One might question whether measuring the time spent really gives insight into the quality of care, and if it might not be more useful to see how that time was spent. We therefore conceived a study to map the EMS care process and evaluate this process in relation to the time used. We used a focused ethnographic study design. Video recordings of EMS deployments in combination with semi-structured interviews of the EMS providers involved, were thematically analysed. This led to insights into the EMS care process and the embedded clinical reasoning. By categorising the professional activities we identified we were able to define a model that describes in general the EMS care process. We reported the first part of this study in which we developed this so called SPART model in a separate paper. In this second part of the study we determined the execution time within a deployment and measured the frequency of occurrence and the duration of the identified activities. We interpreted the operational content and the time variables both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also determined the distribution of activities over the three deployment operational periods (response, on-scene and transport period). Using the SPART model, we gained insight into the different activities' nature, order, and duration. We could qualitatively judge the effectiveness of the clinical reasoning process, i.e., the quality of care delivered. Generally, the studied cases were followable, and the clinical reasoning process was medically logical. The diagnostic process sometimes continued after the clinical decision, which was not medically logical. Remarkably, this never changed the clinical decision. Although this could negatively affect the quality of care, we found no clinical evidence that this was the case. Our findings demonstrated that the quality of care in EMS can be measured by using the SPART model to evaluate EMS deployments. We concluded that qualitative judgment was more important than quantitative evaluation. Interpreting the order of different activities led to the clearest understanding of the clinical reasoning process. It was concluded that knowledge of the exact time used per activity and, in total, had the least impact on understanding the clinical reasoning process.},

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models can increase the accuracy of intravenous drug titration, especially in populations that differ from the 'average.' However, with a growing number of PKPD models, and other technology available to date, it can be hard to see the wood for the trees. This review attempts to guide the reader through the PKPD jungle. General purpose PKPD models for propofol and remifentanil designed to apply to a broader population, including children, the elderly and the obese, reduce the need for population-specific models. PKPD models for drugs such as dexmedetomidine and antimicrobial agents may be useful for procedural sedation or in the ICU. Technological advances such as Bayesian model adjustment based on point-of-care plasma concentration measurements, closed-loop drug delivery and artificial intelligence may improve the ease of use of the anaesthetic drugs and increase the accuracy of titration. Newer and more complex modelling techniques and technological advancements can help to deliver anaesthetic drugs, sedatives and other drugs in a more stable and thereby safer way.},

  abstract = {Ambulatory procedural sedation is used to relieve anxiety, pain and discomfort in a broad spectrum of patients during many types of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. This review focuses on recent comparative studies of commonly used and new drugs for adult ambulatory sedation. Midazolam and propofol are commonly used for ambulatory sedation. Their pharmacological properties offer many advantages and there is much experience with their use. Ketamine can be a useful addition to hypnotic drugs but the advantage of the use of ketofol (a mixture of propofol and ketamine) is, although often practiced, difficult to assess. Dexmedetomidine is a relatively new sedative drug and many studies suggest advantages. New findings about its effects, however, show that the hemodynamic consequences of the use of dexmedetomidine may last for several hours. New sedative drugs for procedural sedation are still being developed: remimazolam has many properties that would make it an ideal sedative and has been studied in a phase 3 study. The properties that would constitute the ideal sedative have yet to be combined in one drug. The selection of the drugs used for ambulatory sedation depends on many factors such as procedure type, patient characteristics and the expectations of patients and the healthcare provider. Because of this, the literature cannot yet provide a definitive answer to the question which drug is best selected in a specific situation.},

  abstract = {To prevent renal graft thrombosis in kidney transplantation, centres use different perioperative anticoagulant strategies, based on various risk factors. In our centre, patients transplanted preemptively are considered at increased risk of renal graft thrombosis compared to patients who are dialysis-dependent at time of transplantation. Therefore these patients are given a single dose of 5000 IU unfractionated heparin intraoperatively before clamping of the vessels. We questioned whether there is a difference in haemostatic state between preemptively and non-preemptively transplanted patients and whether the distinction in intraoperative heparin administration used in our center is justified. For this analysis, citrate samples of patients participating in the VAPOR-1 trial were used and several haemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters were measured in 29 preemptively and 28 non-preemptively transplanted patients and compared to 37 living kidney donors. Sample points were: induction anaesthesia (T1), 5 minutes after reperfusion (T2) and 2 hours postoperative (T3). At T1, recipient groups showed comparable elevated levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4, indicating platelet activation), prothrombin fragment F1+2 and D-dimer (indicating coagulation activation) and Von Willebrand Factor (indicating endothelial activation) compared to the donors. The Clot Lysis Time (CLT, a measure of fibrinolytic potential) was prolonged in both recipient groups compared to the donors. At T3, F1+2, PF4 and CLT were higher in non-preemptively transplanted recipients compared to preemptively transplanted recipients. Compared to donors, non-preemptive recipients showed a prolonged CLT, but comparable levels of PF4 and D-dimer. In conclusion pre-transplantation, preemptively and non-preemptively transplanted patients show a comparable enhanced haemostatic state. A distinction in intraoperative heparin administration between preemptive and non-preemptive transplantation does not seem justified.},

We performed a multicentre randomised controlled trial in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands, the RAVEL trial. Costs were analysed from a health care perspective alongside the RAVEL trial. Pregnant women of intermediate to high risk beyond 32 weeks gestation who planned vaginal delivery. Women were randomised before the onset of labour, to receive either patient controlled remifentanil or epidural analgesia when pain relief was requested during labour. Primary outcome for effectiveness was satisfaction with pain relief, expressed as the area under the curve (AUC). A higher AUC represents higher satisfaction with pain relief. Here, we present an economic analysis from a health care perspective including costs from the start of labour to ten days postpartum. Health-care utilization was documented in the Case Report Forms and by administering an additional questionnaire. The costs in the patient controlled remifentanil group (n = 687) and in the epidural group (n = 671) were €2900 versus €3185 respectively (mean difference of -€282 (95% CI -€611 to €47)). The (non-significant) higher costs in the epidural analgesia group could be mainly attributed to higher costs of neonatal admission. From an economic perspective, there is no preferential pain treatment in labouring intermediate to high risk women. Since patient controlled remifentanil is not equivalent to epidural analgesia with respect to AUC for satisfaction with pain relief we recommend epidural analgesia as the method of choice. However, if appropriately counselled on effect and side effects there is, from an economic perspective, no reason to deny women patient controlled remifentanil.},

The literature search identified 1006 unique articles, of which 13 were ultimately included in the meta-analysis.

No significant differences in other endpoints were identified. Meta-analysis of 13 RCTs published between 2006 and 2016 showed a reduction in respiratory compromise (from respiratory insufficiency to failure) during PSA with the inclusion of capnography monitoring.

For anesthesia and sedation, most of these models are derived from narrow patient populations, which restricts applicability for the overall population, including (small) children, elderly, and obese patients. This forces clinicians to select specific models for specific populations. Recently, general purpose models have been developed for propofol and remifentanil using data from multiple studies and broad, diverse patient groups. General-purpose models might reduce the risks associated with extrapolation, incorrect usage, and unfamiliarity with a specific TCI-model, as they offer less restrictive boundaries (i.e., the patient "doesn't fit in the selected model") compared with the earlier, simpler models. Extrapolation of a model can lead to delayed recovery or inadequate anesthesia. If multiple models for the same drug are implemented in the pump, it is possible to select the wrong model for that specific case; this can be overcome with one general purpose model implemented in the pump. This article examines the usability of these general-purpose models in relation to the more traditional models.},

Data from two clinical trials in healthy volunteers were analysed using remifentanil-alone, propofol-alone, and combination groups. We evaluated remifentanil effects on haemodynamics using a previously developed mechanism-based haemodynamic model of propofol. The interaction between propofol and remifentanil was explored using the principles of the general pharmacodynamic interaction (GPDI) model. Remifentanil alone increased the dissipation rate of total peripheral resistance by 50% at 3.0 ng ml The structure of the previous mechanism-based haemodynamic model for propofol was able to describe the effects of remifentanil alone on haemodynamic variables. The GPDI model provided a good framework for characterising the pharmacodynamic interaction between remifentanil and propofol on haemodynamic properties. NCT02043938; NCT03143972.},

This article reports on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 yr and a subsequent model-based optimization of the used dosing regimen. Thirty-one patients were included in the trial and stratified across four treatment arms: bolus administration, infusion, bolus plus fentanyl, or infusion plus fentanyl. The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan) Sedation Scale (UMSS) was used to assess the depth of sedation. Blood samples were drawn to measure the concentrations of remimazolam and its metabolite CNS7054. Population pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling was performed in NONMEM (GloboMax LLC, USA). A population pharmacokinetic model was developed for remimazolam and CNS7054. The elimination clearance of remimazolam was 0.70 l · min -1 · 70 kg -1 . A proportional odds model combined with a simplified Minto model described the observed UMSS well. The EC50 of remimazolam for a UMSS score of 3 or greater was 777 ng · ml -1 in the absence of fentanyl, and decreased to 655, 533, and 287 ng/ml for concomitant fentanyl steady state concentrations of 1, 2, or 4 ng · ml -1 , respectively. Simulations confirmed that the studied dosing regimen resulted in 9.2 to 22.0% of patients not reaching a UMSS score of 3 or greater at the end of the induction. Model-based optimization resulted in higher per-kilogram dosages and the removal of the maximum allowable dose. Simulations indicated that the percentage of patients achieving a UMSS score of 3 or greater can be expected to be high (88 to 97%). This study has shown that the pharmacokinetics of remimazolam are likely different between children 6 yr or older and adults (after correcting for size). In addition, the exposure-response relationship shows that to effectively use remimazolam for procedural sedation in children 6 yr or older, the dosing regimen should be modified to allow for higher remimazolam exposures.},

This scoping review evaluates existing evidence on the use of TCI systems in ICU settings, focusing on sedation, analgesia, and antibiotic administration. A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline and the Cochrane Library up to August 2024. Studies involving adult ICU patients receiving TCI for any drug were included. Data were extracted on study design, PKPD models, performance metrics, and clinical endpoints. A total of 281 studies were identified; 14 focused on sedatives, particularly propofol and remifentanil, using the Marsh and Minto models. TCI was associated with more stable sedation, improved titration, and fewer adverse events. Evidence on dexmedetomidine and midazolam was limited. Only three studies explored antibiotic TCI, mainly for vancomycin and cefepime, showing potential but lacking robust clinical validation. In conclusion, while current findings are promising, the evidence base supporting TCI-especially in the context of newer, generalized pharmacokinetic models and antibiotics-remains insufficient, and its broader application requires further clinical research and model validation.},

The objective is to assess the hypotheses that this can be overcome by tracking distributions of linear models using anesthesia data, and that anesthetic brain state tracking performance of linear models is comparable to that of a high performing depth of anesthesia monitoring feature. Individuals' brain states are classified by comparing the distribution of linear (auto-regressive moving average-ARMA) model parameters estimated from electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained with a sliding window to distributions of linear model parameters for each brain state. The method is applied to frontal EEG data from 15 subjects undergoing propofol anesthesia and classified by the observers assessment of alertness/sedation (OAA/S) scale. Classification of the OAA/S score was performed using distributions of either ARMA parameters or the benchmark feature, Higuchi fractal dimension. The highest average testing sensitivity of 59% (chance sensitivity: 17%) was found for ARMA (2,1) models and Higuchi fractal dimension achieved 52%, however, no statistical difference was observed. For the same ARMA case, there was no statistical difference if medians are used instead of distributions (sensitivity: 56%). The model-based distribution approach is not necessarily more effective than a median/short-term average approach, however, it performs well compared with a distribution approach based on a high performing anesthesia monitoring measure. These techniques hold potential for anesthesia monitoring and may be generally applicable for tracking brain states.},

Relation between these sources should be time independent, that is, perfectly synchronized. In reality, various issues corrupt time independency, leading to asynchrony or, in other words, hysteresis. This asynchrony can lead to conflicting information, making effective drug dosing challenging. In this study, we tried to quantify and minimize the hysteresis between the Ceprop (calculated using the Schnider model for propofol) and EEG measured drug effect, using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM). Further, we measured the influence of EEG-based monitor choice, namely Bispectral index (BIS) versus qCON index (qCON) monitor, on propofol PD hysteresis. We analyzed the PD data from 165 patients undergoing propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for outpatient surgery. Drugs were administered using target-controlled infusion (TCI) pumps. Pumps were programmed with Schnider model for propofol and Minto model for remifentanil. We constructed 2 PD models (direct models) relating the Schnider Ceprop to the measured BIS and qCON monitor values. We quantified the models' misspecification due to hysteresis, on an individual level, using the root mean squared errors (RMSEs). Subsequently, we optimized the PD models' predictions by adding a lag term to both models (lag-time PD models) and quantified the optimization using the RMSE. There is a counterclockwise hysteresis between Ceprop and BIS/qCON values. Not accounting for this hysteresis results in a direct PD model with an effect-site concentration which produces 50% of the maximal drug effect (Ce50) of 6.24 and 8.62 µg/mL and RMSE (median and interquartile range [IQR]) of 9.38 (7.92-11.23) and 8.41(7.04-10.2) for BIS and qCON, respectively. Adding a modeled lag factor of 49 seconds to the BIS model and 53 seconds to the qCON model improved both models' prediction, resulting in similar Ce50 (3.66 and 3.62 µg/mL for BIS and qCON) and lower RMSE (median (IQR) of 7.87 (6.49-9.90) and 6.56 (5.28-8.57) for BIS and qCON. There is a significant "Ceprop versus EEG measured drug effect" hysteresis. Not accounting for it leads to conflicting PD information and false high Ce50 for propofol in both monitors. Adding a lag term improved the PD model performance, improved the "pump-monitor" synchrony, and made the estimates of Ce50 for propofol more realistic and less monitor dependent.},

One option is to use anaesthetic gas capturing technology at anaesthesia workstation exhausts to harvest and recycle volatile agents. However, the efficiency of such technology is mainly unverified in vivo. The efficiency of CONTRAfluran™ in capturing sevoflurane from an anaesthesia workstation exhaust (when set to minimal flow and end-tidal control mode) was evaluated in 70 adult patients scheduled for general or bariatric laparoscopic surgery. The weight of the sevoflurane vaporiser and CONTRAfluran canister was measured before and after each case, to calculate total sevoflurane consumption and retention. Retention was measured after the minimal flow maintenance phase and after the high flow washout phase. The total retention efficiency was the fraction of all consumed sevoflurane captured by the CONTRAfluran canister. The primary objective was to examine the retention efficiency of CONTRAfluran in a clinical surgical setting, where all feasible strategies to minimise sevoflurane consumption and optimise the efficacy of CONTRAfluran were utilised. The secondary objective was to analyse the correlation between mass transfer and the duration of the case. Mean (SD) volume of sevoflurane captured using CONTRAfluran was 4.82 (1.41) ml, representing 45% (95%CI 42-48%) of all sevoflurane administered. The highest amount of retention was found during the washout phase. Retention efficiency did not correlate with the duration of the case. Over half of the sevoflurane administered was not captured by the CONTRAfluran canister when minimal flow techniques were used, likely due to residual accumulation of sevoflurane in the patient after tracheal extubation or, to a lesser extent, due to ventilation system leakage. However, as every prevented emission is commendable, CONTRAfluran may be a potentially valuable tool for reducing the environmental footprint of sevoflurane-based anaesthesia.},

The Bayesian approach represents the mathematical formulation of the idea that we can update our initial belief about data with the evidence obtained from any kind of acquired data. It provides a theoretical framework and a statistical method to use pre-existing information within the context of new evidence. Several authors have described the Bayesian approach as capable of dealing with uncertainty in medical decision-making. This review describes the Bayes theorem and how it is used in clinical studies in anesthesia and critical care. It starts with a general introduction to the theorem and its related concepts of prior and posterior probabilities. Second, there is an explanation of the basic concepts of the Bayesian statistical inference. Last, a summary of the applicability of some of the Bayesian statistics in current literature is provided, such as Bayesian analysis of clinical trials and PKPD modeling.},

Patients treated with NCRT followed by transthoracic esophagectomy (n = 35) or transthoracic esophagectomy alone (n = 8) were included. Eight different cytokine concentrations were determined during NCRT, esophagectomy, and the first postoperative week. Platelet-activating factor before NCRT was associated with pR (P = .011) and remained elevated in patients with a better response. Concentrations of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein and angiopoietin 1 (Ang-1) were different between patients with and without NCRT. Decreased concentrations of Ang-1 on the third postoperative day were associated with postoperative complications (P = .046). In this observational study, elevated platelet-activating factor concentrations before NCRT were associated with pR. NCRT is associated with decreased Ang-1 concentrations, whereas reduced Ang-1 concentrations were associated with postoperative complications.},

  abstract = {Target controlled infusion (TCI) is a clinically-available and widely-used computer-controlled method of drug administration, adjusting the drug titration towards user selected plasma- or effect-site concentrations, calculated according to pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models. Although this technology is clinically available for several anaesthetic drugs, the contemporary commercialised PKPD models suffer from multiple limitations. First, PKPD models for anaesthetic drugs are developed using deliberately selected patient populations, often excluding the more challenging populations, such as children, obese or elderly patients, of whom the body composition or elimination mechanisms may be structurally different compared to the lean adult patient population. Separate PKPD models have been developed for some of these subcategories, but the availability of multiple PKPD models for a single drug increases the risk for invalid model selection by the user. Second, some models are restricted to the prediction of plasma-concentration without enabling effect-site controlled TCI or they identify the effect-site equilibration rate constant using methods other than PKPD modelling. Advances in computing and the emergence of globally collected databases has allowed the development of new "general purpose" PKPD models. These take on the challenging task of identifying the relationships between patient covariates (age, weight, sex, etc) and the volumes and clearances of multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic models applicable across broad populations from neonates to the elderly, from the underweight to the obese. These models address the issues of allometric scaling of body weight and size, body composition, sex differences, changes with advanced age, and for young children, changes with maturation and growth. General purpose models for propofol, remifentanil and dexmedetomidine have appeared and these greatly reduce the risk of invalid model selection. In this narrative review, we discuss the development, characteristics and validation of several described general purpose PKPD models for anaesthetic drugs.},

Because preceding studies have not been able to exclude the contribution of surgical trauma, perioperative stress, or both to circulating cytokine concentrations, the effects of anaesthesia remain unclear. The aim of this study was to quantify serum cytokines in healthy volunteers administered i.v. anaesthetic agents in the absence of surgical trauma and perioperative stress. Serum samples obtained during previous standardised studies from healthy volunteers were compared before and 6-8 h after induction of anaesthesia with propofol (n=31), propofol/remifentanil (n=30), dexmedetomidine (n=17) or dexmedetomidine/remifentanil (n=15). Anaesthetic regimens were standardised and volunteers did not undergo any surgical intervention. Serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)2, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL17, IL18, IL21, IL22, IL23, C-X-C motif ligand 8, interferon gamma, E-selectin, L-selectin, major histocompatibility complex class I chain-polypeptide-related sequence (MIC)A, MICB, Granzyme A, and Granzyme B were quantified using a multiplexed antibody-based assay (Luminex). Samples were obtained from volunteers of either sex aged 18-70 yr. After anaesthesia with propofol alone, concentrations of IL4 (P=0.012), IL6 (P=0.027), IL21 (P=0.035), IL22 (P=0.002), C-X-C motif ligand 8 (P=0.004), MICB (P=0.046), and Granzyme A (P=0.045) increased.

University hospital. 6 ASA physical status III and IV patients with end-stage liver disease, undergoing liver transplantation. Neuromuscular transmission was monitored electromyographically. After recovery of T1/T0 to 10%, cisatracurium was infused at an initial rate of 1.5 microg/kg/min. The infusion rate was adjusted to maintain T1/T0 at 10%. At the end of surgery, spontaneous recovery from the neuromuscular block was awaited. The infusion rate of cisatracurium was 1.6 +/- 0.4 microg/kg/min. Before the anhepatic phase, this rate was 1.5 +/- 0.4 microg/kg/min; during the anhepatic phase it was 1.7 +/- 0.5 microg/kg/min; and after reperfusion it was 1.9 +/- 0.4 microg/kg/min. There was a significant difference between the cisatracurium infusion rates before and after the anhepatic phase (p < 0.05). Following termination of the infusion, the time to 25% recovery of T1/T0 was 19.2 +/- 6.1 minutes, the recovery index (25% to 75%) was 28.8 +/- 7.0 minutes, and the time for the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to reach 0.7 was 50.2 +/- 7.1 minutes. The time for the TOF ratio to reach 0.9 was 61.4 +/- 6.6 minutes. There was no difference in body temperature or pH during the consecutive stages of transplantation. The infusion dose requirement for cisatracurium during liver transplantation tended to be higher than previously reported in healthy patients; recovery appeared prolonged. In continuous infusion of cisatracurium during liver transplantation, the tendency toward higher dose requirements, the protracted duration of infusion, the non-Hofmann elimination and/or other pharmacokinetic changes during transplantation might influence recovery from the neuromuscular block. Potential temperature or pH change during surgery seemed irrelevant in explaining the delayed recovery.},

  abstract = {: Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) has become a widespread practice given the increasing demand to relieve anxiety, discomfort and pain during invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The role of, and credentialing required by, anaesthesiologists and practitioners performing PSA has been debated for years in different guidelines. For this reason, the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) and the European Board of Anaesthesiology have created a taskforce of experts that has been assigned to create an evidence-based guideline and, whenever the evidence was weak, a consensus amongst experts on: the evaluation of adult patients undergoing PSA, the role and competences required for the clinicians to safely perform PSA, the commonly used drugs for PSA, the adverse events that PSA can lead to, the minimum monitoring requirements and post-procedure discharge criteria. A search of the literature from 2003 to 2016 was performed by a professional librarian and the retrieved articles were analysed to allow a critical appraisal according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. The Taskforce selected 2248 articles. Where there was insufficiently clear and concordant evidence on a topic, the Rand Appropriateness Method with three rounds of Delphi voting was used to obtain the highest level of consensus among the taskforce experts.These guidelines contain recommendations on PSA in the adult population. It does not address sedation performed in the ICU or in children and it does not aim to provide a legal statement on how PSA should be performed and by whom. The National Societies of Anaesthesiology and Ministries of Health should use this evidence-based document to help decision-making on how PSA should be performed in their countries. The final draft of the document was available to ESA members via the website for 4 weeks with the facility for them to upload their comments. Comments and suggestions of individual members and national Societies were considered and the guidelines were amended accordingly. The ESA guidelines Committee and ESA board finally approved and ratified it before publication.},

  abstract = {Remimazolam exhibits sedative properties by binding to γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors. Remimazolam is administered as a bolus dose or continuous infusion, but has not been studied using target-controlled infusion (TCI). The study quantified the relationship between the remimazolam concentration, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAAS) score, and bispectral index (BIS) using TCI. The authors performed a three-period, crossover, dose-ranging clinical trial in 24 healthy volunteers using age and sex stratification. Data collected in the first period, where remimazolam was administered alone using a step-up and step-down TCI protocol, were used for this analysis. Remimazolam concentrations, MOAAS scores, and BIS values were collected at each step at steady state. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methodology. The relationship between remimazolam, BIS, and MOAAS differed between step-up and step-down infusions at similar remimazolam target concentrations. Tolerance, driven by remimazolam or CNS7054, significantly improved overall model fit (P < 0.01) for both BIS and MOAAS models. After 30 min of repeated bolus dosing, mimicking the regimen in the label for procedural sedation, the BIS and probability of MOAAS 2/3 were predicted to be 54 (95% prediction interval, 44 to 67) and 2% (95% prediction interval, 0 to 32%) versus 58 (95% prediction interval, 48 to 70) and 8% (95% prediction interval, 0 to 36%) in a model without and with tolerance, respectively. After 60 min of continuous infusion, mimicking the regimen in the label for general anesthesia, the BIS and probability of MOAAS 0 were predicted to be 40 (95% prediction interval, 33 to 50) and 87% (95% prediction interval, 18 to 100%) versus 50 (95% prediction interval, 41 to 60) and 59% (95% prediction interval, 6 to 99%) in a model without and with tolerance, respectively. In this study, it was shown that remimazolam-induced sedation is prone to tolerance development, which is potentially mediated by the CNS7054 concentration. The clinical consequences are, however, limited in situations where remimazolam is titrated to effect.},

Simulations of remifentanil TCI were performed using three PK models (Minto, Eleveld, and Kim). We sought to identify models and target concentrations for remifentanil administration in children, adult, older people, and severely obese individuals, consistent with the remifentanil product label.

This approach did not necessarily identify target concentrations that achieve desired clinical effect, only those that are consistent with the product label recommended doses. We estimate that plasma target concentrations of 3.1-5.3 ng ml},

Using large-scale EEG recordings and machine learning techniques, we investigated whether dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation indeed mimics natural sleep patterns. We used EEG recordings from three sources in this study: 8,707 overnight sleep EEG and 30 dexmedetomidine clinical trial EEG. Dexmedetomidine-induced sedation levels were assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We extracted 22 spectral features from each EEG recording using a multitaper spectral estimation method. Elastic-net regularization method was used for feature selection. We compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest), trained on individual sleep stages, to predict different levels of the MOAA/S sedation state. The random forest algorithm trained on non-rapid eye movement stage 3 (N3) predicted dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation (MOAA/S = 0) with area under the receiver operator characteristics curve >0.8 outperforming other machine learning models. Power in the delta band (0-4 Hz) was selected as an important feature for prediction in addition to power in theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (16-30 Hz) bands. Using a large-scale EEG data-driven approach and machine learning framework, we show that dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation state mimics N3 sleep EEG patterns.

Sixty subjects were divided into 10 cohorts and received an increasing, single bolus of either ABP-700 or placebo. Safety was assessed by clinical laboratory evaluations, infusion-site reactions, continuous monitoring of vital signs, physical examination, adverse event monitoring, and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing. Clinical effects were assessed with modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation and Bispectral Index monitoring. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Stopping criteria were met at 1.00 mg/kg dose. No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events were dose-dependent and comprised involuntary muscle movement, tachycardia, and ventilatory effects. Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation evoked a physiologic cortisol response in all subjects, no different from placebo. Pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional. A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model described the data well. A rapid onset of anesthesia/sedation after bolus administration and also a rapid recovery were observed.

The pharmacodynamics of propofol and sevoflurane were described on both population and individual levels using a clinical score and the Patient State Index. Patient State Index-2 has an improved performance at higher sevoflurane concentrations, and the relationship to probability of responsiveness depends on the drug used but is unaffected for Patient State Index-1 and Patient State Index-2.},

  abstract = {Remimazolam is a benzodiazepine with a high affinity for the γ-aminobutyric acid type A-receptor thereby inducing sedation and amnesia. It is a short-acting drug, has a fast onset, short duration of action, and a predictable recovery profile. Remimazolam is metabolized mainly into CNS7054. In recent years, numerous population pharmacokinetic and combined pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies have been published. This narrative review aims to give an overview of and insight into pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models and related clinical effects. Body weight, age and American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, sex, hepatic function, and extracorporeal circulation have been shown to significantly impact remimazolam pharmacokinetics. Body mass index, race, concomitant opioid administration, and a CNS7054-induced tolerance effect may be covariates. The labeling of remimazolam is not consistent worldwide as it has been approved for general anesthesia and/or sedation in different countries. To date, remimazolam is only approved by the intravenous route. Remimazolam has been approved for general anesthesia and/or sedation. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting seems higher compared with propofol, yet pain on injection is less common. One study has published population pharmacokinetics in children. Reports on alternative methods to intravenous administration have been sparse.},

  abstract = {In the University Medical Center Groningen in Groningen, the Netherlands, moderate-to-deep sedation is provided by nursing staff trained and supervised by the anesthesia department using protocol-based target-controlled infusions (TCIs) of propofol and remifentanil. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the incidence of events with potential adverse health consequences within this service model and the risk factors for the occurrence of these events. We retrospectively interrogated a database containing the computerized anesthetic records of 2937 procedures where moderate-to-deep sedation was provided using TCI administration of propofol and remifentanil between May 2014 and October 2017. The primary outcome measures were the incidence of sedation-related events with potential adverse health consequences and risk factors for the occurrence of such events. The events under investigation were unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), death on the day of the procedure due to sedation-related events, cardiovascular events (arrhythmias, hypertension, and hypotension), pulmonary events (aspiration, desaturation, unplanned tracheal intubation), anaphylactic or allergic reactions, and the termination of the procedure due to sedation-related events. Cardiovascular and pulmonary events were classified as severe, significant, or moderate. Events were identified by using computer algorithms to search the computerized records from all included procedures. Data from 2937 procedures were analyzed. No patients suffered catastrophic events (death, need for CPR, or unplanned ICU admission). Thirty-two severe sedation-related events occurred in 32 procedures. Severe desaturation (0.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-0.9) and severe hypertension (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.04-0.37) were the most common severe events. Significant hypotension (8.8%; 95% CI, 7.73-9.77) and significant desaturation (1.6%; 95% CI, 1.12-2.02) were found to be the most common events with potential adverse health consequences. No patient suffered lasting health consequences. Average mean and maximum targeted effect-site concentrations (Cet) for propofol were 2.6 ± 0.83 and 3.3 ± 1.09 µg·mL, respectively, and for remifentanil 0.84 ± 0.18 and 0.99 ± 0.22 ng·mL, respectively. Maximum Cets of propofol were lower among patients with higher body mass index (BMI) and were higher among patients of younger age. Higher BMI was a risk factor for desaturation. Increased age and lower BMI were risk factors for hypotension. Longer procedure time was a risk factor for both desaturation and hypotension. Moderate-to-deep sedation by propofol and remifentanil TCI has a low incidence of catastrophic and severe events.},

Synergy is often observed when sedative-hypnotics are combined with opioid analgesics in anesthetic practice. A three-phase crossover trial was conducted to study the pharmacodynamic interaction between remifentanil and dexmedetomidine. After institutional review board approval, 30 age- and sex- stratified healthy volunteers were studied. The subjects received consecutive stepwise increasing target-controlled infusions of dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, and remifentanil with a fixed dexmedetomidine background concentration. Drug effects were measured using binary (yes or no) endpoints: no response to calling the subject by name, tolerance of shaking the patient while shouting the name ("shake and shout"), tolerance of deep trapezius squeeze, and tolerance of laryngoscopy. The drug effect was measured using the electroencephalogram-derived "Patient State Index." Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling related the administered dexmedetomidine and remifentanil concentration to these observed effects. The binary endpoints were correlated with dexmedetomidine concentrations, with increasing concentrations required for increasing stimulus intensity. Estimated model parameters for the dexmedetomidine EC50 were 2.1 [90% CI, 1.6 to 2.8], 9.2 [6.8 to 13], 24 [16 to 35], and 35 [23 to 56] ng/ml, respectively. Age was inversely correlated with dexmedetomidine EC50 for all four stimuli. Adding remifentanil did not increase the probability of tolerance of any of the stimuli. The cerebral drug effect as measured by the Patient State Index was best described by the Hierarchical interaction model with an estimated dexmedetomidine EC50 of 0.49 [0.20 to 0.99] ng/ml and remifentanil EC50 of 1.6 [0.87 to 2.7] ng/ml. Low dexmedetomidine concentrations (EC50 of 0.49 ng/ml) are required to induce sedation as measured by the Patient State Index. Sensitivity to dexmedetomidine increases with age. Despite falling asleep, the majority of subjects remained arousable by calling the subject's name, "shake and shout," or a trapezius squeeze, even when reaching supraclinical concentrations. Adding remifentanil does not alter the likelihood of response to graded stimuli.},

  abstract = {In anaesthetic practice the risk of cerebral ischemic/hypoxic damage is thought to be attenuated by deep anaesthesia. The rationale is that deeper anaesthesia reduces cerebral oxygen demand more than light anaesthesia, thereby increasing the tolerance to ischemia or hypoxia. However, evidence to support this is scarce. We thus investigated the influence of light versus deep anaesthesia on the responses of rat brains to a period of hypoxia. In the first experiment we exposed adult male Wistar rats to deep or light propofol anaesthesia and then performed [18F]- Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans to verify the extent of cerebral metabolic suppression. In subsequent experiments, rats were subjected to light/deep propofol anaesthesia and then exposed to a period of hypoxia or ongoing normoxia (n = 9-11 per group). A further 5 rats, not exposed to anaesthesia or hypoxia, served as controls. Four days later a Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test was performed to assess mood and cognition. After another 4 days, the animals were sacrificed for later immunohistochemical analyses of neurogenesis/neuroplasticity (Doublecortin; DCX), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression and neuroinflammation (Ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein-1; Iba-1) in hippocampal and piriform cortex slices. The hippocampi of rats subjected to hypoxia during light anaesthesia showed lower DCX positivity, and therefore lower neurogenesis, but higher BDNF levels and microglia hyper-ramification. Exploration was reduced, but no significant effect on NOR was observed. In the piriform cortex, higher DCX positivity was observed, associated with neuroplasticity. All these effects were attenuated by deep anaesthesia. Deepening anaesthesia attenuated the brain changes associated with hypoxia. Hypoxia during light anaesthesia had a prolonged effect on the brain, but no impairment in cognitive function was observed. Although reduced hippocampal neurogenesis may be considered unfavourable, higher BDNF expression, associated with microglia hyper-ramification may suggest activation of repair mechanisms. Increased neuroplasticity observed in the piriform cortex supports this, and might reflect a prolonged state of alertness rather than damage.},

  abstract = {Maintaining brain function and integrity is a pivotal part of anesthesiological practice. The present overview aims to describe the current role of the 2 most frequently used monitoring methods for evaluation brain function in the perioperative period, ie, electroencephalography (EEG) and brain oxygenation monitoring. Available evidence suggests that EEG-derived parameters give additional information about depth of anesthesia for optimizing anesthetic titration. The effects on reduction of drug consumption or recovery time are heterogeneous, but most studies show a reduction of recovery times if anesthesia is titrated along processed EEG. It has been hypothesized that future EEG-derived indices will allow a better understanding of the neurophysiological principles of anesthetic-induced alteration of consciousness instead of the probabilistic approach most often used nowadays.Brain oxygenation can be either measured directly in brain parenchyma via a surgical burr hole, estimated from the venous outflow of the brain via a catheter in the jugular bulb, or assessed noninvasively by near-infrared spectroscopy. The latter method has increasingly been accepted clinically due to its ease of use and increasing evidence that near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oxygen saturation levels are associated with neurological and/or general perioperative complications and increased mortality. Furthermore, a goal-directed strategy aiming to avoid cerebral desaturations might help to reduce these complications. Recent evidence points out that this technology may additionally be used to assess autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and thereby help to titrate arterial blood pressure to the individual needs and for bedside diagnosis of disturbed autoregulation.},

Expensive clinical trials are required to validate any newly developed processed EEG monitor for every drug and combinations of drugs due to drug-specific EEG patterns. There is a need for an alternative, efficient, and economical method. Using deep learning algorithms, we developed a novel data-repurposing framework to predict hypnotic levels from sleep brain rhythms. We used an online large sleep data set (5723 clinical EEGs) for training the deep learning algorithm and a clinical trial hypnotic data set (30 EEGs) for testing during dexmedetomidine infusion. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). The deep learning model (a combination of a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory units) trained on sleep EEG predicted deep hypnotic level with an accuracy (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 81 (79.2-88.3)%, AUC (95% CI) = 0.89 (0.82-0.94) using dexmedetomidine as a prototype drug. We also demonstrate that EEG patterns during dexmedetomidine-induced deep hypnotic level are homologous to nonrapid eye movement stage 3 EEG sleep. We propose a novel method to develop hypnotic level monitors using large sleep EEG data, deep learning, and a data-repurposing approach, and for optimizing such a system for monitoring any given individual. We provide a novel data-repurposing framework to predict hypnosis levels using sleep EEG, eliminating the need for new clinical trials to develop hypnosis level monitors.},

The Patient Safety and Quality Committee (PSQC) of ESA invited experts in their fields to contribute, and these experts addressed their topic in different ways; there are classical, narrative reviews, more systematic reviews, political statements, personal opinions and also original data presentation.

Twenty-one patients treated with cefepime according to the standard of care were included. Cefepime was administered through continuous infusion using TCI for a median duration of 4.5 days. TCI was based on a previously developed population PK model incorporating the estimated creatinine clearance based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula as the input variable to calculate cefepime clearance. A cefepime blood concentration of 16 mg/liter was targeted. To evaluate the measured versus predicted plasma concentrations, blood samples were taken (median of 10 samples per patient), and total cefepime concentrations were measured using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The performance of the TCI system was evaluated using Varvel criteria. Half (50.3%) of the measured cefepime concentrations were within ±30% around the target value of 16 mg liter},

  abstract = {Etomidate is a hypnotic agent that is used for the induction of anesthesia. It produces its effect by acting as a positive allosteric modulator on the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor and thus enhancing the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid. Etomidate stands out among other anesthetic agents by having a remarkably stable cardiorespiratory profile, producing no cardiovascular or respiratory depression. However, etomidate suppresses the adrenocortical axis by the inhibition of the enzyme 11β-hydroxylase. This makes the drug unsuitable for administration by a prolonged infusion. It also makes the drug unsuitable for administration to critically ill patients. Etomidate has relatively large volumes of distributions and is rapidly metabolized by hepatic esterases into an inactive carboxylic acid through hydrolyzation. Because of the decrease in popularity of etomidate, few modern extensive pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies exist. Over the last decade, several analogs of etomidate have been developed, with the aim of retaining its stable cardiorespiratory profile, whilst eliminating its suppressive effect on the adrenocortical axis. One of these molecules, ABP-700, was studied in extensive phase I clinical trials. These found that ABP-700 is characterized by small volumes of distribution and rapid clearance. ABP-700 is metabolized similarly to etomidate, by hydrolyzation into an inactive carboxylic acid. Furthermore, ABP-700 showed a rapid onset and offset of clinical effect. One side effect observed with both etomidate and ABP-700 is the occurrence of involuntary muscle movements. The origin of these movements is unclear and warrants further research.},

This infusion mode uses pharmacokinetic models to calculate infusion rates necessary to reach and maintain the desired drug concentration. TCI is computationally more complex than traditional modes of drug administration. The primary difference between TCI and conventional infusions is that TCI decreases the infusion rate at regular intervals to account for the uptake of drug into saturable compartments. Although the calculated infusion rates are consistent with manually controlled infusion rates, there are concerns that TCI administration of IV anesthetics could introduce unique safety concerns. After approximately 2 decades of clinical use, it is appropriate to assess the safety of TCI. Our aim in this article was to describe safety-relevant issues related to TCI, which should have emerged after its use in millions of patients. We collected information from published medical literature, TCI manufacturers, and publicly available governmental Web sites to find evidence of safety issues with the clinical use of TCI. Although many case reports emphasize that IV anesthesia is technically more demanding than inhaled anesthesia, including human errors associated with setting up IV infusions, no data suggest that a TCI mode of drug delivery introduces unique safety issues other than selecting the wrong pharmacokinetic model. This is analogous to the risk of selecting the wrong drug with current infusion pumps. We found no evidence that TCI is not at least as safe as anesthetic administration using constant rate infusions.},

  abstract = {Target-controlled infusion (TCI) systems incorporating pharmacokinetic (PK) or PK-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models can be used to facilitate drug administration. Existing models were developed using data from select populations, the use of which is, strictly speaking, limited to these populations. Recently a propofol PK-PD model was developed for a broad population range. The aim of the study was to prospectively validate this model in children, adults, older subjects, and obese adults undergoing general anaesthesia. The 25 subjects included in each of four groups were stratified by age and weight. Subjects received propofol through TCI with the Eleveld model, titrated to a bispectral index (BIS) of 40-60. Arterial blood samples were collected at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 60 min after the start of propofol infusion, and every 30 min thereafter, to a maximum of 10 samples. BIS was recorded continuously. Predictive performance was assessed using the Varvel criteria. For PK, the Eleveld model showed a bias < ±20% in children, adults, and obese adults, but a greater bias (-27%) in older subjects. Precision was <30% in all groups. For PD, the bias and wobble were <5 BIS units and the precision was close to 10 BIS units in all groups. Anaesthetists were able to achieve intraoperative BIS values of 40-60 using effect-site target concentrations about 85-140% of the age-adjusted Ce The Eleveld propofol PK-PD model showed predictive precision <30% for arterial plasma concentrations and BIS predictions with a low (population) bias when used in TCI in clinical anaesthesia practice.},

The new Oxygen Reserve Index (ORi), a relative indicator of the partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood (PaO2) in the range of 100-200 mm Hg, may allow additional monitoring of oxygen status. In this prospective validation intervention study, 20 healthy volunteers were breathing standardized oxygen concentrations ranging from mild hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.14) to hyperoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 1.0) via a tight-fitting face mask. ORi was measured noninvasively by multiwavelength pulse co-oximetry using 2 finger sensors. These ORi values (unitless scale, 0.00-1.00) were compared with measured PaO2 values. Repeated-measurements correlation analysis was performed to assess the ORi/PaO2 relationship. ORi trending ability was assessed using a 4-quadrant plot. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to assess the prediction of hypoxia (low-ranged PaO2, <100 mm Hg). Within the ORi-sensitive range, a strong positive correlation was found between ORi and PaO2 for both sensors (R = 0.78 and 0.83; P < .0001). ORi trending of PaO2 was good within this range (concordance rate = 94%). The prediction of PaO2 <100 mm Hg was also good, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.91 and 99% sensitivity and 82% specificity. In this prospective volunteer validation study, a strong and positive correlation between PaO2 and ORi was found, together with a good trending ability. Based on these data, the future use of ORi as a continuous noninvasive monitoring tool for assessing oxygenation status in patients receiving supplemental oxygen might be supported.},

A clinical trial simulation was conducted. This simulation was based on a comprehensive database of clinical records of intensive care unit patients and a systematic review of currently available population-pharmacokinetic models for vancomycin in intensive care unit patients. Dosing strategies were compared in terms of the probability of achieving efficacious concentrations as well as the potential for inducing toxicity. Adaptive target-controlled infusion outperforms rule-based dosing guidelines for vancomycin. In the first 48 h of treatment, the probability of target attainment is significantly higher for adaptive target-controlled infusion than for the second-best method (Cristallini). Probability of target attainments of 54 and 72% and 47 and 59% for both methods after 24 and 48 h, respectively. Compared to the Cristallini method, which is characterized by a probability of attaining concentrations above 30 mg.L Our study shows that adaptive target-controlled infusion has the potential to become a practical tool for patient-tailored antibiotic dosing in the intensive care unit.},

Fifty-six donor-recipient couples from the Volatile Anesthetic Protection of Renal Transplants-1 (VAPOR-1) trial were included. Systemic venous, systemic arterial, and renal venous samples were taken at multiple timepoints during and after LDKT. Levels of mtDNA genes changed over time and between vascular compartments. Several donor, recipient, and transplantation-related variables significantly explained the course of mtDNA genes over time. mtDNA genes predicted 1-month and 24-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and acute rejection episodes in the two-year follow-up period. To conclude, mtDNA is released in plasma during the process of LDKT, either from the kidney or from the whole body in response to transplantation. While circulating mtDNA levels positively and negatively predict post-transplantation outcomes, the exact mechanisms and difference between mtDNA genes are not yet understood and need further exploration.},

Sevoflurane, a volatile anesthetic known to protect against IRI in other organ systems, has not previously been explored in the context of kidney NMP. This study aimed to establish a stable and reproducible porcine kidney NMP model incorporating sevoflurane delivery. Different administration techniques and oxygenator setups were evaluated to identify the most effective method of sevoflurane application. Administering sevoflurane directly as a liquid into the perfusate resulted in excessive gas formation and unstable drug concentrations. In contrast, using a vaporizer connected to an Inspire 8F M oxygenator allowed for stable and reproducible sevoflurane levels over a 90-min perfusion period, while maintaining sufficient oxygenation. This method proved to be a reliable approach for sevoflurane delivery in kidney NMP. However, oxygenators exposed to sevoflurane should not be reused due to the risk of membrane damage. These findings support the feasibility of using sevoflurane in kidney NMP and provide a platform for further investigation into its potential to improve renal graft outcomes.},

Data were pooled using a random-effects model, while outcomes from non-eligible studies for meta-analysis were reported separately. Risk of bias was assessed through the cochrane risk of bias (ROB) 2 tool. Twenty-three studies were included. Only studies using growth hormone, nandrolone, and oxandrolone were found. Growth hormone improved nitrogen balance (standardized mean difference = 1.4 g, 95% confidence interval 0.47-2.32). While mortality was unaffected, it caused increased ICU and hospital stay. A substantial heterogeneity and a concerning risk of bias were present among the studies. PEDs showed no survival benefit but may improve nitrogen balance. A possible subgroup that could benefit from growth hormone or anabolic steroids are critically ill patients who have surpassed the acute inflammatory phase of critical illness.

The vast majority of the developed models underpredict the measured plasma concentrations with respect to the target concentration, especially at plasma concentrations higher than those used in the original studies. The aim of this article was to develop a dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic model in healthy adults emphasizing linear versus nonlinear kinetics. The data of two previously published clinical trials with stepwise increasing dexmedetomidine target-controlled infusion were pooled to build a pharmacokinetic model using the NONMEM software package (ICON Development Solutions, USA). Data from 48 healthy subjects, included in a stratified manner, were utilized to build the model. A three-compartment mamillary model with nonlinear elimination from the central compartment was superior to a model assuming linear pharmacokinetics. Covariates included in the final model were age, sex, and total body weight. Cardiac output did not explain between-subject or within-subject variability in dexmedetomidine clearance. The results of a simulation study based on the final model showed that at concentrations up to 2 ng · ml-1, the predicted dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations were similar between the currently available Hannivoort model assuming linear pharmacokinetics and the nonlinear model developed in this study. At higher simulated plasma concentrations, exposure increased nonlinearly with target concentration due to the decreasing dexmedetomidine clearance with increasing plasma concentrations. Simulations also show that currently approved dosing regimens in the intensive care unit may potentially lead to higher-than-expected dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations. This study developed a nonlinear three-compartment pharmacokinetic model that accurately described dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations. Dexmedetomidine may be safely administered up to target-controlled infusion targets under 2 ng · ml-1 using the Hannivoort model, which assumed linear pharmacokinetics. Consideration should be taken during long-term administration and during an initial loading dose when following the dosing strategies of the current guidelines.},

Patients were assigned to either the normal-low potassium target (nLP group, 4.0 mmol/L) or the normal-high potassium target (nHP group, 4.5 mmol/L) in alternating blocks of 50 patients. Potassium levels were regulated using a validated computer-assisted potassium replacement protocol (GRIP-II). The primary end point was the incidence of AF/AFL on a 12-lead electrocardiogram during the first postoperative week. Of the 910 patients, 447 were assigned to the nLP group; and 463, to the nHP group, with no baseline differences between the 2 groups. The mean daily administered dose of potassium was 30 ± 23 mmol (nLP) versus 52 ± 27 mmol (nHP) (P < .001), which resulted in mean intensive care unit potassium concentration of 4.22 ± 0.36 mmol/L and 4.33 ± 0.34 mmol/L, respectively (P < .001). The incidence of AF/AFL after cardiac surgery did not differ: 38% in the nLP group and 41% in the nHP group. Also in several subgroups (eg, patients not known with prior AF/AFL or with valve surgery), there were no differences. There were no differences in incidence of AF/AFL with 2 potassium regulation strategies with different potassium targets and different amounts of potassium administered in patients after cardiac surgery.},

We have explored the effect of involuntary muscle movement on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for the GABAA receptor agonist ABP-700 and its effects on the Bispectral Index (BIS) as well as the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores. Observations from 350 individuals (220 men, 130 women) were analyzed, comprising 6,312 ABP-700 concentrations, 5,658 ABP-700 metabolite (CPM-acid) concentrations, 25,745 filtered BIS values, and 6,249 MOAA/S scores, and a recirculatory model developed. Various subject covariates and pretreatment with an opioid or a benzodiazepine were explored as covariates. Relationships between BIS and MOAA/S models and involuntary muscle movements were examined. The final model shows that the pharmacokinetics of ABP-700 are characterized by small compartmental volumes and rapid clearance. The BIS model incorporates an effect-site for BIS suppression and a secondary excitatory/disinhibitory effect-site associated with a risk of involuntary muscle movements. The secondary effect-site has a threshold that decreases with age. The MOAA/S model did not show excitatory effects. The GABAA receptor agonist ABP-700 shows the expected suppressive effects for BIS and MOAA/S, but also disinhibitory effects for BIS associated with involuntary muscle movements and reduced by pretreatment. Our model provides information about involuntary muscle movements that may be useful to improve depth of anesthesia monitoring for GABAA receptor agonists.},

The purpose of this investigation was to develop a PK-PD model for remimazolam and perform covariate analysis to maximise its utility across broad, diverse populations and to evaluate its consistency with clinical observations of drug dosing. Arterial and venous concentrations of remimazolam and its metabolite, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score and bispectral index were determined in 20 studies. Final population models were developed with covariate analysis. Simulations of drug administration for sedation and anaesthesia for this and previously published models were compared with the results of clinical studies. Model development proceeded from 933 individuals aged 6-93 yr and weight 21-171 kg. PK data from studies with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and treatment in ICU were considered in a post hoc analysis. Simulations of target-controlled infusion with the final model targeting sedation (Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score 2 or 3) or anaesthesia (bispectral index 50) showed drug administration declining with age consistent with clinical observations. A PK-PD model for remimazolam was developed for a broad, diverse population.

  abstract = {Monitoring of drug concentrations in breathing gas is routinely being used to individualize drug dosing for the inhalation anesthetics. For intravenous anesthetics however, no decisive evidence in favor of breath concentration monitoring has been presented up until now. At the same time, questions remain with respect to the performance of currently used plasma pharmacokinetic models implemented in target-controlled infusion systems. In this study, we investigate whether breath monitoring of propofol could improve the predictive performance of currently applied, target-controlled infusion models. Based on data from a healthy volunteer study, we developed an addition to the current state-of-the-art pharmacokinetic model for propofol, to accommodate breath concentration measurements. The potential of using this pharmacokinetic (PK) model in a Bayesian forecasting setting was studied using a simulation study. Finally, by introducing bispectral index monitor (BIS) measurements and the accompanying BIS models into our PK model, we investigated the relationship between BIS and predicted breath concentrations. We show that the current state-of-the-art pharmacokinetic model is easily extended to reliably describe propofol kinetics in exhaled breath. Furthermore, we show that the predictive performance of the a priori model is improved by Bayesian adaptation based on the measured breath concentrations, thereby allowing further treatment individualization and a more stringent control on the targeted plasma concentrations during general anesthesia. Finally, we demonstrated concordance between currently advocated BIS models, relying on predicted effect-site concentrations, and our new approach in which BIS measurements are derived from predicted breath concentrations.},

This study aimed to characterize the influence of remifentanil on the sedative properties of remimazolam as measured by MOAAS, BIS, and tolerance to laryngoscopy or tetanic stimulation (TOL or TOTS) and to determine target concentrations that maximize MOAAS 2 or 3. A three-period, crossover, dose-ranging clinical trial was performed in 24 healthy volunteers. In all periods, remimazolam was administered using a step-up and step-down target controlled infusion protocol (50 to 2,000 ng/ml). Stable remifentanil target concentrations of 0.5 ng/ml and 0.1 to 4.0 ng/ml were maintained in periods 2 and 3, respectively. Remifentanil, remimazolam, and CNS7054 (metabolite) concentrations and MOAAS, BIS, TOL, and TOTS were collected in each step of the target controlled infusion protocol. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects models, where P ≤ 0.01 was considered significant. Remifentanil reduced the apparent clearance of CNS7054 with a half-maximum inhibition at 8.0 ng/ml (95% CI, 5.5 to 13.4 ng/ml). A pharmacodynamic interaction was detected on all endpoints. Simulations indicate that the probability of observing a MOAAS 2 or 3 is highest at remimazolam target concentration of 275, 250, or 200 ng/ml combined with 0, 0.1, or 0.5 ng/ml remifentanil resulting in probabilities of 45%, 45%, and 44%, respectively. Additionally, simulations indicate that the highest probability of observing TOTS and TOL was 93.3% and 85.5%, respectively, at the highest studied target concentrations. A pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction between remimazolam and remifentanil was quantified in this clinical trial. Appropriate target concentrations for MOAAS and BIS could be estimated, but for TOL and TOTS, the trial design did not allow to fully characterize the exposure-response relationship.},

Multichannel EEG datasets from two different sources were used in this study: (1) sedation dataset consisting of 102 healthy volunteers receiving propofol (N = 36), sevoflurane (N = 36), or dexmedetomidine (N = 30), and (2) publicly available sleep EEG dataset (N = 994). Forty-four quantitative time, frequency and entropy features were extracted from EEG recordings and were used to train the machine learning algorithms on sleep dataset to predict sleep stages in the sedation dataset. The predicted sleep states were then compared with the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation (MOAA/S) scores. The performance of the model was poor (AUC = 0.55-0.58) in differentiating sleep stages during propofol and sevoflurane sedation. In the case of dexmedetomidine, the AUC of the model increased in a sedation-dependent manner with NREM stages 2 and 3 highly correlating with deep sedation state reaching an AUC of 0.80. We addressed an important clinical question to identify biological sleep promoting sedatives using EEG signals. We demonstrate that propofol and sevoflurane do not promote EEG patterns resembling natural sleep while dexmedetomidine promotes states resembling NREM stages 2 and 3 sleep, based on current sleep staging standards.},

Technological advancement has made autonomous systems, also known as robots, an integral part of our life in several fields, including medicine. The application of robots in anesthesia could be classified into 3 types of robots. The first ones are pharmacological robots. These robots are based on closed-loop systems that allow better-individualized anesthetic drug titration for optimal homeostasis during general anesthesia and sedation. Recent evidence also demonstrates that autonomous systems could control hemodynamic parameters proficiently outperforming manual control in the operating room. The second type of robot is mechanical. They enable automated motorized reproduction of tasks requiring high manual dexterity level. Such robots have been advocated to be more accurate than humans and, thus, could be safer for the patient. The third type is a cognitive robot also known as decision support system. This type of robot is able to recognize crucial clinical situation that requires human intervention. When these events occur, the system notifies the attending clinician, describes relevant related clinical observations, proposes pertinent therapeutic options and, when allowed by the attending clinician, may even administer treatment. It seems that cognitive robots could increase patients' safety. Robots in anesthesia offer not only the possibility to free the attending clinicians from repetitive tasks but can also reduce mental workload allowing them to focus on tasks that require human intelligence such as analytical and clinical approach, lifesaving decision-making capacity, and interpersonal interaction. Nevertheless, further studies have yet to be done to test the combination of these 3 types of robots to maintain simultaneously the homeostasis of multiple biological variables and to test the safety of such combination on a large-scale population.},

In total, 102 subjects receiving propofol (N=36; 16 male/20 female), sevoflurane (N=36; 16 male/20 female), or dexmedetomidine (N=30; 15 male/15 female) were included in this study of healthy volunteers. Sedation level was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We used 44 QEEG features estimated from the EEG data in a logistic regression algorithm, and an elastic-net regularisation method was used for feature selection. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the logistic regression model. The performances obtained when the system was trained and tested as drug-dependent mode to distinguish between awake and sedated states (mean AUC [standard deviation]) were propofol=0.97 (0.03), sevoflurane=0.74 (0.25), and dexmedetomidine=0.77 (0.10). The drug-independent system resulted in mean AUC=0.83 (0.17) to discriminate between the awake and sedated states. The incorporation of large numbers of QEEG features and machine learning algorithms is feasible for next-generation monitors of sedation level. Different QEEG features were selected for propofol, sevoflurane, and dexmedetomidine groups, but the sedation-level estimator maintained a high performance for predicting MOAA/S independent of the drug used.

Data from the Simple Intensive Care Studies-II prospective cohort study of acutely admitted critically ill adults, including data collected during the first 7 days of admission such as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score-related measurements, were used to fit a mixed-effects logistic regression model for next-day deterioration. Deterioration was defined as a decline in the total (≥2) and organ-specific (≥1) SOFA scores. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. A total of 1009 patients were included. The final predictive model for overall next-day deterioration included six predictors (the total SOFA score on the current day, the minimum value of arterial pH, Glasgow Coma Scale score, mean arterial blood pressure, mechanical ventilation, and its effect differing between the first and subsequent ICU days). The model achieved an AUC of 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.78). In the decision curve analysis, within probability thresholds of 0.2-0.5, the model showed a higher net benefit than did strategies of treating all patients or treating no patients. Organ-specific prediction models for next-day deterioration in respiration, cardiovascular, and renal function showed slightly better performance than the overall model (AUCs: 0.79, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively). Daily prediction models can predict next-day disease severity in overall, respiration, cardiovascular, and renal function amongst ICU patients. They offer clinical benefits within a range of probability thresholds and could support decision-making for ICU physicians.},

Regarding regional and local anesthesia, 13 (31%) centers regularly practice regional anesthesia blocks, and 11 (26.2%) centers use wound infiltration by the surgical team. This European survey revealed that implementation of ERAS concepts in pediatric cardiac surgery is generally low, with considerable heterogeneity in clinical practice regarding the timing of extubation, the choice of surgical procedures triggering on-table extubation, the choice of anesthetic drugs and the use of regional anesthesia. More coordinated efforts are needed to implement ERAS concepts in pediatric cardiac surgery and harvest the benefits of ERAS concepts for the pediatric cardiac population.},

The results are compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) (P<.05). Awake, there was no difference between mouse strains (Bb, 0.3+/-0.7 P min(-1), C3, 0.4+/-0.7 P min(-1) and F1, 0.4+/-0.5 P min(-1)). In contrast, during anesthesia C3 mice showed a significantly higher incidence of pauses and apneas. There was no increase for B6 and F1 mice. There was no difference depending on the volatile agent. These results indicate an inheritance of a susceptibility to pauses and apneas under the influence of volatile anesthetics, albeit independent of the agent used. This response seems to be independent from the inherited response to hypercapnia.},

This study aimed to compare Omniplasma and FFP used for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) priming regarding the incidence of postoperative thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications and outcomes in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery. A retrospective observational cohort study SETTING: This single-center study was performed at the University Medical Center Groningen. All pediatric patients up to 10 kg undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Procedures in which FFP was used for CPB priming were compared with those in which Omniplasma was used. The primary outcome parameter was a composite endpoint consisting of the following: (1) pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) mortality, (2) thromboembolic complications, and (3) hemorrhagic complications during PICU stay. The authors included 143 procedures in the analyses, 90 (63%) in the FFP group and 53 (37%) in the Omniplasma group. The occurrence of the combined primary endpoint (FFP 20% v Omniplasma 11%, p = 0.18) and its components did not differ between the used CPB priming agent). Omniplasma for CPB priming was associated with decreased unfractionated heparin administration per kg bodyweight (585 IU v 510 IU, p = 0.03), higher preoperative and postoperative activated clotting times (ACT) discrepancy (90% v 94%, p = 0.03), a lower postoperative ACT value (125 v 118 seconds, p = 0.01), and less red blood cell transfusion per kilogram bodyweight (78 v 55 mL, p = 0.02). However, none of the variables differed statistically significantly in the multivariate logistic regression analyses. The authors did not find an association between the plasma used for CPB priming and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications and death in neonates and infants undergoing cardiac surgery. Omniplasma seems to be safe to use in this population.},

Previous isolated forearm technique data suggest that the incidence of connected consciousness may approach 37% after a noxious stimulus. The authors conducted an international, multicenter, pragmatic study to establish the incidence of isolated forearm technique responsiveness after intubation in routine practice. Two hundred sixty adult patients were recruited at six sites into a prospective cohort study of the isolated forearm technique after intubation. Demographic, anesthetic, and intubation data, plus postoperative questionnaires, were collected. Univariate statistics, followed by bivariate logistic regression models for age plus variable, were conducted. The incidence of isolated forearm technique responsiveness after intubation was 4.6% (12/260); 5 of 12 responders reported pain through a second hand squeeze. Responders were younger than nonresponders (39 ± 17 vs. 51 ± 16 yr old; P = 0.01) with more frequent signs of sympathetic activation (50% vs. 2.4%; P = 0.03). No participant had explicit recall of intraoperative events when questioned after surgery (n = 253). Across groups, depth of anesthesia monitoring values showed a wide range; however, values were higher for responders before (54 ± 20 vs. 42 ± 14; P = 0.02) and after (52 ± 16 vs. 43 ± 16; P = 0.02) intubation. In patients not receiving total intravenous anesthesia, exposure to volatile anesthetics before intubation reduced the odds of responding (odds ratio, 0.2 [0.1 to 0.8]; P = 0.02) after adjustment for age. Intraoperative connected consciousness occurred frequently, although the rate is up to 10-times lower than anticipated. This should be considered a conservative estimate of intraoperative connected consciousness.},

A survey was conducted to explore the degree of implementation of ERACS in pediatric cardiac surgery across Europe. The results of the intraoperative phase have been reported previously. The present study examined implementation of ERACS preoperatively and postoperatively. Prospective, 79-item, web-based cross-sectional survey. Survey endorsed by the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology and Intensive Care. Lead anesthesiologists of active European pediatric cardiac surgical centers. None. Responses were received and analyzed from 42 of 89 centers (43%), with 16 centers (38.1%) reporting implemented ERACS protocols for pediatric cardiac surgery. Preoperative anemia assessment is common (73.8%), but anemia treatment and preoperative transfusion practices vary. In centers following ERACS protocols fasting times are reduced particularly for clear fluids (<1 hour: 50% v 26.9%) and light meals (<4 hours: 62.5% v 26.9%). However, preoperative assessment of nutritional status is performed only rarely (42.9% overall; 18.8% in ERACS centers). Drain removal tends to occur earlier in centers following ERACS protocols (within 12 hours: 33.3% v 4.8%). ERACS implementation for children undergoing cardiac surgery varies substantially among the responding centers and is overall low, particularly during the preoperative period. ERACS centers show a higher implementation of measures such as a liberal approach to preoperative fasting and early drain removal but lack in other measures, such as preoperative treatment of anemia and assessment of nutritional status. Overall, these data demonstrate a large potential for improvement in the preoperative and postoperative management of children undergoing cardiac surgery.},

We compared the ability of APW-based variations in stroke volume (SVV) and pulse pressure (PPV) and of PW-based plethysmographic variability index (PVI) to predict fluid responsiveness and to track fluid changes in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Furthermore, we assessed whether the PPV/SVV ratio, as a measure of dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn), could predict a reduction in norepinephrine requirement after fluid administration. Thirty patients received i.v. fluid (15 ml kg(-1) in 30 min) after hepatic resection and were considered responders when stroke volume index (SVI) increased ≥20% after fluid administration. SVV and SVI were measured by the FloTrac-Vigileo(®) device, and PVI was measured by the Masimo Radical 7 pulse co-oximeter(®). The areas under a receiver operating characteristic curve for SVV, PPV, and PVI were 0.81, 0.77, and 0.78, respectively. In responders, all dynamic variables, except PVI, decreased after fluid administration. Eadyn predicted a reduced norepinephrine requirement (AUC = 0.81). In patients undergoing major hepatic resection, both APW- and PW-based dynamic preload variables predict fluid responsiveness (preload) to a similar extent. Most variables (except PVI) also tracked fluid changes. Eadyn, as a measure of arterial elastance (afterload), might be helpful to distinguish the origin of hypotension.

We aimed to assess agreement of somatic and renal near-infrared spectroscopy with reference blood samples. O3 sensors were placed bilaterally on the quadriceps and flank of 26 healthy volunteers. A stepped, controlled hypoxia sequence was performed by adding a mixture of nitrogen and room air to the breathing circuit. O3-derived oxygen saturation values were obtained at baseline and at six decremental saturation levels (5% steps). Blood samples (radial artery, iliac vein (somatic reference) and renal vein) were obtained at each step. Reference values were calculated as: 0.7 × venous saturation + 0.3 × arterial saturation. The agreement between O3-derived values with blood reference values was assessed by calculating root-mean-square error accuracy and Bland-Altman plots. The root-mean-square error accuracy was 6.0% between quadriceps oxygen saturation and somatic reference values. The mean bias was 0.8%, with limits of agreement from -7.7 to 9.3%. These were 5.1% and 0.6% (-8.3 to 9.5%) for flank oxygen saturation and somatic reference values, respectively, and 7.7% and -4.9% (-15.0 to 5.2%) for flank oxygen saturation and renal reference values. The kidney depth was 3.1 ± 0.9 cm below the skin. O3 regional oximetry can be used on the quadriceps and flank to monitor somatic saturation, yet has a saturation-level dependent bias. O3-derived values obtained at the flank underestimated renal reference values. Additionally, it is unlikely that the flank sensors did directly measure renal tissue.

Correlation was significant between SpHb and Hb(satlab) (R(2)=0.50, n=543). The modified Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements showed a bias (precision) of -0.27 (1.06) and -0.02 (1.07) g dl(-1) for the steady-state and dynamic phases, respectively. SpHb accuracy increased when Hb(satlab) was <10 g dl(-1), with a bias (precision) of 0.41 (0.47) vs -0.26 (1.12) g dl(-1) for values >10 g dl(-1), but accuracy decreased after colloid administration (R(2)=0.25). SpHb correlated moderately with Hb(satlab) with a slight underestimation in both phases in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Accuracy increased for lower Hb(satlab) values but decreased in the presence of colloid solution. Further improvements are necessary to improve device accuracy under these conditions, so that SpHb might become a sensitive screening device for clinically significant anaemia.},

  abstract = {1. Many poultry houses are illuminated by fluorescent lamps which produce discontinuous illumination with a frequency of either 100 or 120 Hz. 2. This study investigated whether domestic fowls perceive this discontinuity as flicker by training two Leghorn hens to choose between a continuous and a discontinuous light, all other variables being identical. 3. The light-stimulus was either monochromatic with 100% sinusoidal modulation or a fluorescent lamp whose modulation frequency could be electrically adjusted. 4. Each (correct) choice for the discontinuous light was followed by a 5 Hz higher frequency, whereas an incorrect choice was followed by a 10 Hz lower frequency. 5. On the basis of this principle the animals themselves established the highest perceivable frequency of the discontinuous light, called the Critical Fusion Frequency (CFF), that they could discriminate from continuous light. 6. These frequencies typically depend on the stimulus intensity increasing with increasing intensities, until a maximum value is reached. 7. Two factors limited the magnitudes of the CFF's that were recorded: the maximum stimulus intensities produced and variability in the chicken's response ("behavioural noise"). In spite of these constraints 105 Hz was established as the maximum CFF. 8. On the basis of extrapolation it is concluded that the direct light from fluorescent lamps driven by 50 Hz alternating current is seen by the chicken as flickering. 9. The results justify large-scale comparison of behaviour and production in poultry houses that are illuminated either by low-frequency or by high-frequency fluorescent lamps.},

The interest in using minimally invasive cardiac output monitors is growing. The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available devices to provide an overview of their validation studies in order to answer the question whether these devices are ready for implementation in clinical practice. Current evidence shows that minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring devices are not yet interchangeable with (trans)pulmonary thermodilution in measuring cardiac output. However, validation studies are generally single centre, are based on small sample sizes in heterogeneous groups, and differ in the statistical methods used. Minimally and noninvasive monitoring devices may not be sufficiently accurate to replace (trans)pulmonary thermodilution in estimating cardiac output. The current paradigm shift to explore trending ability rather than investigating agreement of absolute values alone is to be applauded. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of these devices in the context of (functional) haemodynamic monitoring before adoption into clinical practice can be recommended.},

We explored the agreement of MAPcNIAP and MAPiNIAP with the gold standard: continuous invasive MAP measurement by placement of a radial artery catheter (MAPinvasive). In a total of 120 patients undergoing elective general surgery and clinically requiring MAPinvasive measurement, MAPiNIAP and MAPcNIAP were measured in a 30 min time period at an arbitrary moment during surgery with stable haemodynamics. MAPiNIAP was measured every 5 min. Data from 112 patients were analysed. Compared with MAPinvasive, modified Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias (sd) of 2 (9) mm Hg for MAPcNIAP and -2 (12) mm Hg for MAPiNIAP. Percentage errors for MAPcNIAP and MAPiNIAP were 22% and 32%, respectively. In a haemodynamically stable phase in patients undergoing general anaesthesia, the agreement with invasive MAP of continuous non-invasive measurement using a finger cuff was not inferior to the agreement of intermittent arm cuff oscillometry. Continuous measurements using a finger cuff can interchangeably be used as an alternative for intermittent arm cuff oscillometry in haemodynamically stable patients, with the advantage of beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring.

The relative luminous efficiency as a function of pupil position (Stiles-Crawford effect) was determined for the same seven subjects on the same apparatus in the 1960s and in 1995. The pupil opening was traversed nine times, at 20 degrees azimuth intervals. Data were fit with a revolution paraboloid yielding a peak position (x0, y0) and a peakedness (rho). Two of seven subjects showed a significant, but small, decrease in rho, and the other five showed, no change. No clear outcome in x0, y0 changes could be reported because of differences in pupil dilation then and now. Although exceptions are found on the stability of the Stiles-Crawford effect with age, the authors can still conclude that it is stable.},

The platelet- and granulocyte-bound immunoglobulins could be eluted in 93% and 67% of the cases, respectively. This indicates that specific autoantibodies, rather than circulating immune complexes, which were frequently increased, accounted for the findings.

Experimental work, mainly on rabbits, was reviewed and complemented with the results of calculations on the thermal changes in the ocular media. Safe exposure limits were derived over the optical spectrum from the near ultraviolet to the far infrared. Lasers may be a cause of thermal cataract only in the near ultraviolet.

A retrospective analysis of intraoperative transesophageal 3-dimensionalechocardiographic MV datasets was performed. A mathematical model was created to assess the mitral CRI for each leaflet segment (A1-P1, A2-P2, A3-P3). Mitral CRI was defined as the ratio between the coaptation reserve (measured coaptation length along the closure line) and an individualized correction factor. Indexing was chosen to correct for MV sphericity and area of largest valve opening. Mathematical models were created to simulate progressive mitral annular dilatation and to predict the effect on the individual mitral CRI. At a single-center academic hospital. Twenty-five patients with normally functioning MVs undergoing cardiac surgery. None. Direct measurement of leaflet coaptation along the closure line showed the lowest amount of coaptation (reserve) near the commissures (A1-P1 0.21 ± 0.05 cm and A3-P3 0.22 ± 0.06 cm), and the highest amount of coaptation (reserve) at region A2 to P2 0.25 ± 0.06 cm. After indexing, the A2-to-P2 region was the area with the lowest CRI in the majority of patients, and also the area with the least resistance to mitral regurgitation (MR) occurrence after simulation of progressive annular dilation. Quantification and indexing of mitral coaptation reserve along the closure line are feasible. Indexing and mathematical simulation of progressive annular dilatation consistently showed that indexed coaptation reserve was lowest in the A2-to-P2 region. These results may explain why this area is prone to lose coaptation and is often affected in MR.},

A randomised controlled study. Single-centre, University Medical Center Groningen, The Netherlands. Sixty normovolaemic patients under balanced propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia. If the mean arterial pressure (MAP) dropped below 80% of the awake state value, phenylephrine (100 μg + 0.5 μg kg(-1) min(-1)) or norepinephrine (10 μg + 0.05 μg kg(-1) min(-1)) was administered in a randomised fashion. MAP, HR, SV, CI, SctO2, SptO2 and rate-pressure product (RPP) analysed from 30 s before drug administration until 240 s thereafter. Phenylephrine and norepinephrine caused an equivalent increase in MAP [Δ = 13 (8 to 22) and Δ = 13 (9 to 19) mmHg, respectively] and SV [Δ = 6 ± 6 and Δ = 5 ± 7 ml, respectively], combined with a significant equivalent decrease in HR (both Δ = -8 ± 6 bpm), CI (both Δ = -0.2 ± 0.3 l min(-1) m(-2)) and SctO2 and an unchanged RPP (Δ = 345 ± 876 and Δ = 537 ± 1076 mmHg min(-1)). However, SptO2 was slightly but statistically significantly (P < 0.05) decreased after norepinephrine [Δ  = -3 (-6 to 0)%] but not after phenylephrine administration [Δ = 0 (-1 to 1)%]. In both groups, SptO2 after vasopressor was still higher than the awake value. In normovolaemic patients under balanced propofol/remifentanil anaesthesia, phenylephrine and norepinephrine produced similar clinical effects when used to counteract anaesthesia-induced hypotension. After norepinephrine, a fall in peripheral tissue oxygenation was statistically significant, but its magnitude was not clinically relevant.},

  abstract = {In the 1920s and 1930s, disability glare was a topic of great interest in the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE). The Second World War prevented agreement being reached on a standard to quantify disability glare but the Stiles-Holladay formula was widely accepted as such. In 1983, CIE started a new effort to develop a CIE standard making use of research data published in the post-war years. A committee was formed that agreed that new data and insights justified an extension of the angular domain of a disability glare formula and allowed introduction of an age factor and allowance for ocular pigmentation. Three disability glare equations were formulated, each for an appropriately restricted angular domain. The most general, the CIE General Disability Glare equation, covers the full angular range between 0.1 degrees and 100 degrees but for optometrists the CIE Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay Disability Glare equation, with validity domain between one degree and 30 degrees, will often suffice. Disability glare is due to intraocular scatter and obeys, in the one-degree to 30-degree angular domain, albeit with great individual spread, the Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay equation: (L(veil) /E(glare))(Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay) = 10 (1 + [Age/70](4)).1/theta(2). Quantitative examples are given of the manifestation of disability glare, particularly in traffic.},

Though any verification of these psychological attributes seems to be absent, this depth effect in colour still seems to be taken for granted in art history. In visual science, the completely different and far better documented colour stereoscopic effect, known as chromostereopsis, prevails. A historical account is given of the development of ideas about this chromostereopsis, often by amusing trials and errors. The original explanation by Bruecke in terms of chromatic aberration (in present-day literature usually indicated as transverse chromatic aberration) and a temporal off-axis position of the fovea still forms the basis of present-day understanding, even though Bruecke rejected his own explanation. It had to be complemented by an additional off-axis effect of the pupil, not in an anatomical sense, as Einthoven presumed but failed to find but in a functional sense by a non-centric Stiles-Crawford effect. Although a comprehensive individual experimental proof is still missing, the evidence available indicates that a satisfactory quantitative explanation has been reached.},

  abstract = {Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) very commonly accompanies general anaesthesia in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. The development of IOH is unwanted, since it is associated with adverse outcomes such as acute kidney injury and myocardial injury, stroke and mortality. Although the definition of IOH is variable, harm starts to occur below a mean arterial pressure (MAP) threshold of 65 mmHg. The odds of adverse outcome increase for increasing duration and/or magnitude of IOH below this threshold, and even short periods of IOH seem to be associated with adverse outcomes. Therefore, reducing the hypotensive burden by predicting and preventing IOH through proactive appropriate treatment may potentially improve patient outcome. In this review article, we summarise the current state of the prediction of IOH by the use of so-called machine-learning algorithms. Machine-learning algorithms that use high-fidelity data from the arterial pressure waveform, may be used to reveal 'traits' that are unseen by the human eye and are associated with the later development of IOH. These algorithms can use large datasets for 'training', and can subsequently be used by clinicians for haemodynamic monitoring and guiding therapy. A first clinically available application, the hypotension prediction index (HPI), is aimed to predict an impending hypotensive event, and additionally, to guide appropriate treatment by calculated secondary variables to asses preload (dynamic preload variables), contractility (dP/dt},

  abstract = {The dye indocyanine green is familiar to anaesthetists, and has been studied for more than half a century for cardiovascular and hepatic function monitoring. It is still, however, not yet in routine clinical use in anaesthesia and critical care, at least in Europe. This review is intended to provide a critical analysis of the available evidence concerning the indications for clinical measurement of indocyanine green elimination as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in two areas: its role in peri-operative liver function monitoring during major hepatic resection and liver transplantation; and its role in critically ill patients on the intensive care unit, where it is used for prediction of mortality, and for assessment of the severity of acute liver failure or that of intra-abdominal hypertension. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that indocyanine green elimination measurements in these patient populations can provide diagnostic or prognostic information to the clinician, 'hard' evidence - i.e. high-quality prospective randomised controlled trials - is lacking, and therefore it is not yet time to give a green light for use of indocyanine green in routine clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Several variables that may affect accurate measurement of platelet-associated IgG (PA-IgG) were studied using a radioimmunoassay of the consumption type. The amount of PA-IgG of washed, unfixed normal donor platelets was 1.0 +/- 0.9 fg IgG/platelet (mean +/- 2 SD). Upon storage of washed platelets in a buffer containing EDTA, the amount decreased significantly to 0.2 +/- 0.2 fg IgG/platelet. Simultaneously, an increase in modal platelet volume was observed. Similar results were obtained when platelets were fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA). We postulate that this decrease in PA-IgG is caused by the release of plasma IgG entrapped by the surface-connected canicular system of the platelet, when the platelets swell during storage in EDTA or fixation with PFA. This presence of varying amounts of entrapped plasma IgG may cause the wide discrepancies in PA-IgG found in normal donor platelets as well as platelets from ITP patients by other investigators. A good quantification of platelet-bound alloantibodies was possible with our assay when platelets were routinely fixed to diminish the amount of nonspecific PA-IgG. This was demonstrated with different anti-Zwa (= anti-PlA1), anti-Baka and anti-HLA sera. We also observed that fragments of platelets as well as fragments of cells of other types can cause aspecifically increased Pa-IgG values and can thus interfere with the proper measurement of platelet-bound antibodies in all kinds of immunoassays in general.},

The association of compliance with perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols and postoperative outcomes is unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of protocol compliance on postoperative outcomes following high-risk surgery, after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol. Through a before-after study design, patients undergoing elective high-risk surgery before (before-group) and after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol (after-group) were included. Perioperative goal-directed therapy in the after-group consisted of optimized stroke volume variation or stroke volume index and optimized cardiac index. Additionally, the association of protocol compliance with postoperative complications when using perioperative goal-directed therapy was assessed. High protocol compliance was defined as ≥ 85% of the procedure time spent within the individual targets. The difference in complications during the first 30 postoperative days before and after implementation of the protocol was assessed. In the before-group, 214 patients were included and 193 patients in the after-group. The number of complications was higher in the before-group compared to the after-group (n = 414 vs. 282; p = 0.031). In the after-group, patients with high protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index had less complications compared to patients with low protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index (n = 187 vs. 90; p = 0.01). Protocol compliance by the attending clinicians is essential and should be monitored to facilitate an improvement in postoperative outcomes desired by the implementation of perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols.},

  abstract = {A brief review of retinal light damage is presented. Thermal damage requires a local rise in temperature of at least 10 °C, causing an instant denaturation of proteins. The primary absorber is melanin. Photochemical damage occurs at body temperature and involves cellular damage by reactive forms of oxygen. The photosensitizers are photoproducts of the visual pigments. First indications that non-thermal damage might exist, in particular in the case of eclipse blindness, was presented by Vos in 1962. Attribution thereof to photochemical action was presented in 1966 by Noell et al who also measured the first action spectrum, in rat. It turned out to be identical to the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin. However, in 1976 and 1982 Ham et al found a quite different spectrum in monkeys, peaking at short wavelengths. The latter spectrum, but not the former, was confirmed since in numerous publications with animal models including rat. In ophthalmological practice a 'sunburn' was at first the only complaint caused by light damage. To avoid this, patients with dilated pupils should always be advised to wear sunglasses. Since the invention of the laser accidents have been reported, the most recent development is youth playfully pointing a strong laser pen in their eyes with marked consequences. The operation microscope and endoilluminators should always be used as brief as possible to avoid photochemical damage. Arguments for implant lenses that block not only the UV but also part of the visible spectrum seem too weak to justify extra costs.},

Patients with critical limb ischemia are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events and subsequent cardiovascular death. Little is known about the incidence and consequences of these adverse events. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adverse cardiac events on mortality in patients with critical limb ischemia undergoing surgical or endovascular treatment. A retrospective cohort study including all patients with critical limb ischemia aged ≥65 undergoing surgical or endovascular treatment for critical limb ischemia between January 2013 and June 2018 was conducted. Data on adverse cardiac events were collected from medical records. The effect of an adverse cardiac event on mortality during 6 months follow-up was analyzed with a multivariable cox proportional hazards model to adjust for confounders. Effects are displayed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total number of 449 patients were included. Median age was 76 years, 52.8% of patients were male. In total, 51 patients (11%) developed an adverse cardiac event, 31 patients (10%) in the surgical group and 20 patients (14%) in the endovascular group. After adjustment for confounders, adverse cardiac events were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 3.5 95% CI 2.1-5.9). This study showed that adverse cardiac events commonly occur in elderly patients with critical limb ischemia. Adverse cardiac events continue to occur even months after treatment and are associated with an increased mortality risk. These findings justify routine cardiac evaluation in both surgical and endovascular treatment. Additionally, frequent postdischarge cardiac follow-up in the outpatient clinic may be helpful in limiting the occurrence of adverse cardiac events.},

The AUROC of serum bilirubin and PT at postoperative day 5 were 0.68 and 0.49, respectively.

Most patients (94.1%) with a positive direct test had a positive indirect test on the eluate. Thus, platelet-bound antibodies but not platelet-bound immune complexes were present in most, if not all, patients. Positive immunofluorescence tests were obtained for many patients with a diagnosis other than ITP. This resulted in a low specificity of the test for the diagnosis of ITP, evidently because autoimmune thrombocytopenia occurred together with many other diseases and also because antibodies against platelet cryptantigens (expressed by the action of EDTA or by platelet fixation) were present in many patients.},

Few studies have examined the effectiveness of predicting FR according to the definition of FR, and assessment of inconclusive values of PPV and SVV around the cut-off value (the "grey zone") might improve individual FR prediction. We explored the ability of noninvasive volume clamp derived measurements of PPV and SVV to predict FR using the grey zone approach, and we assessed the influence of multiple thresholds on the predictive ability of the numerical definition of FR. Ninety patients undergoing general surgery were included in this prospective observational study and received a 500 mL fluid bolus as deemed clinically required by the attending anesthesiologist. A minimal relative increase in stroke volume index (↑SVI) was used to define FR with different thresholds from 10-25%. The PPV, SVV, and SVI were measured using the Nexfin® device that employs noninvasive volume clamp plethysmography. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve gradually increased for PPV / SVV with higher threshold values (from 0.818 / 0.760 at 10% ↑SVI to 0.928 / 0.944 at 25% ↑SVI). The grey zone limits of both PPV and SVV changed from 9-16% (PPV) and 5-13% (SVV) at the 10% ↑SVI threshold to 18-21% (PPV) and 14-16% (SVV) at the 25% ↑SVI threshold. Noninvasive PPV and SVV measurements allow an acceptable FR prediction, although the reliability of both variables is dependent on the intended increase in SVI, which improves substantially with concomitant smaller grey zones at higher ↑SVI thresholds.},

In addition, optimal surgical conditions and safe and fast emergence are pivotal parts of anesthetic management. In high-antinociceptive propofol/remifentanil anesthesia with bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 60, norepinephrine was administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 80% of individual baseline. Fluid was administered if the ∆ plethysmographic waveform amplitude exceeded 10%. Surgical and recovery conditions, hemodynamic responses, and tissue oxygenation were investigated. Mean (SD) StO2 at the left thenar eminence increased from 83 (6)% before to 86 (4)% 20 min after induction of anesthesia (p <0.05).

Thirteen out of 40 patients received a fluid bolus. The median (range) norepinephrine administration rate was 0.05 (0.0-0.10) μg kg(-1) min(-1). After complete akinesia in all patients during surgery, a median (IQR) extubation time of 311 (253-386) s was observed. This high-antinociceptive balanced anesthesia with goal-directed fluid and vasopressor therapy adequately preserved StO2 and hemodynamic homeostasis. ISRCTN20153044.},

Secondarily, we assessed if an educational intervention and mandated mean arterial pressure (MAP), or the implementation of the Hypotension Prediction Index-software (HPI) were associated with a reduction in IOH. Structured interviews (n = 27) and questionnaires (n = 84) were conducted to explore clinicians' beliefs and barriers to IOH treatment, in addition to usefulness of HPI questionnaires (n = 14). 150 elective major surgical patients who required invasive blood pressure monitoring were included in three cohorts to assess incidence and time-weighted average (TWA) of hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg). Cohort one received standard care (baseline), the clinicians of cohort two had a training on hypotension and a mandated MAP > 65 mmHg, and patients of the third cohort received protocolized care using the HPI. Clinicians felt challenged to manage IOH in some patients, yet they reported sufficient knowledge and skills. HPI-software was considered useful and beneficial. No difference was found in incidence of IOH between cohorts. TWA was comparable between baseline and education cohort (0.15 mmHg [0.05-0.41] vs. 0.11 mmHg [0.02-0.37]), but was significantly lower in the HPI cohort (0.04 mmHg [0.00 to 0.11], p < 0.05 compared to both). Clinicians believed they had sufficient knowledge and skills, which could explain why no difference was found after the educational intervention. In the HPI cohort, IOH was significantly reduced compared to baseline, therefore HPI-software may help prevent IOH. ISRCTN 17,085,700 on May 9th, 2019.},

We recommend basing intra-operative arterial pressure management on mean arterial pressure and keeping intra-operative mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg. We further recommend identifying the underlying causes of intra-operative hypotension and addressing them appropriately. We suggest pragmatically treating bradycardia or tachycardia when it leads to profound hypotension or likely results in reduced cardiac output, oxygen delivery or organ perfusion. We suggest monitoring stroke volume or cardiac output in patients with high baseline risk for complications or in patients having high-risk surgery to assess the haemodynamic status and the haemodynamic response to therapeutic interventions. However, we recommend not routinely maximising stroke volume or cardiac output in patients having noncardiac surgery. Instead, we suggest defining stroke volume and cardiac output targets individually for each patient considering the clinical situation and clinical and metabolic signs of tissue perfusion and oxygenation. We recommend not giving fluids simply because a patient is fluid responsive but only if there are clinical or metabolic signs of hypovolaemia or tissue hypoperfusion. We suggest monitoring and optimising the depth of anaesthesia to titrate doses of anaesthetic drugs and reduce their side effects.},

  abstract = {Tissue hypoperfusion occurs frequently during surgery and may contribute to postoperative organ dysfunction. There is a need for perioperative treatment protocols aiming at improving tissue oxygenation (StO2). We hypothesised that intra-operative optimisation of StO2 improves tissue perfusion and thus reduces postoperative complications. Furthermore, we evaluated the feasibility of the optimisation algorithm used. We randomized 50 high-risk patients, all >65 years with ASA physical status III, who underwent major abdominal surgery under standardized balanced general anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia. Throughout surgery StO2 was monitored at the thenar eminence using near-infrared spectroscopy. All patients were treated according to a standard care algorithm. In addition, patients in the intervention group were treated with dobutamine if necessary to keep or raise StO2 ≥ 80%. Data were recorded continuously and complications were recorded during hospital stay with a maximum of 28 days. The number of complications was not significantly different between groups (11 vs 20; p = 0.23). Eleven patients in the intervention group had no complication, versus 7 in the control group. There was no significant difference between groups in length of stay in ICU or in hospital. Only ten patients in the intervention group received dobutamine. Administration of dobutamine resulted in a moderate 6 [-3 to 10] % increase of StO2. The overall protocol adherence was 94%. No statistically significant difference in outcome was realized through intraoperative optimization of StO2 values in this pilot study. The protocol used may be considered feasible for clinical practice. Further research is obligatory to define both the optimal StO2 threshold and intervention to treat tissue hypoperfusion.

The majority of these papers investigated the use of either cerebral or peripheral tissue oxygen saturation, derived non-invasively using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In some of these studies, the microcirculation was "provocated" by inducing short-term tissue hypoxia, allowing the assessment of functional microvascular reserve. Additionally, studies on technical differences between NIRS monitors are summarized, as well as studies investigating the feasibility of NIRS monitoring, mainly in the pediatric patient population. Last but not least, novel monitoring tools allow assessing oxygenation at a (sub)cellular level, and those papers incorporating these techniques are also reviewed here.},

Other macro-hemodynamic variables like pulse pressure or stroke volume variation are additionally used as markers of fluid responsiveness. In recent years, an increasing number of technological devices assessing tissue oxygenation or microcirculatory blood flow have been developed and validated, and some of them have already been incorporated into clinical practice. In this review, we will summarize recent research findings on this topic as published in the last 2 years in the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing (JCMC). While some techniques are already currently used as routine monitoring (e.g. cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)), others still have to find their way into clinical practice. Therefore, further research is needed, particularly regarding outcome measures and cost-effectiveness, since introducing new technology is always expensive and should be balanced by downstream savings. The JCMC is glad to provide a platform for such research.},

Therefore, we evaluated whether induced hypo- and hypervolaemia result in changes in central blood volumes (pulmonary blood volume (PBV), intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV)) and we explored the effects on the distribution between these central blood volumes and circulating blood volume (Vd circ). Six anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing Foxhound dogs underwent random blood volume alterations in steps of 150 ml (mild) to 450 ml (moderate), either by haemorrhage, retransfusion of blood, or colloid infusion. PBV, ITBV and Vd circ were measured using (transpulmonary) dye dilution. The PBV/Vd circ ratio and the ITBV/Vd circ ratio were used as an assessment of blood volume distribution. 68 blood volume alterations resulted in changes in Vdcirc ranging from -33 to +31%. PBV and ITBV decreased during mild and moderate haemorrhage, while during retransfusion, PBV and ITBV increased during moderate hypervolaemia only. The PBV/Vd circ ratio remained constant during all stages of hypo- and hypervolaemia (mean values between 0.20-0.22). This was also true for the ITBV/Vd circ ratio, which remained between 0.31 and 0.32, except for moderate hypervolaemia, where it increased slightly to 0.33 (0.02), P<0.05. Mild to moderate blood volume alterations result in changes of Vd circ, PBV and ITBV. The ratio between the central blood volumes and Vd circ generally remained unaltered. Therefore, it could be suggested that in anaesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs, the cardiovascular system maintains the distribution of blood between central and circulating blood volume.},

Thereafter the patient is assessed by a multidisciplinary team (psychologist, physical therapist, anesthesiologist-pain specialist, physiatrist and vascular surgeon). During a multidisciplinary meeting professionals summarize their assessment. Pros and cons of an amputation are discussed, taking into account level of amputation and expectations about post amputation functioning of patient and team. Based on assessments and discussion a consensus based decision is formulated and the patient is informed. If it is decided that an amputation is to be performed, the amputation will follow shortly. If it is decided not to amputate, the decision is extensively explained to the patient. Incidence of patients suffering from therapy resistant CRPS-I referred for amputation is low and because referred patients are strongly in favor of an amputation, a randomized controlled trial will be difficult to perform. Hence level of evidence in favor or against an amputation will remain low. We therefore report our decision making process to facilitate discussion about this difficult and delicate matter.},

Because central sensitisation is not directly assessable in humans, the term 'human assumed central sensitisation' (HACS) is suggested. The objectives were to investigate what definitions for HACS have been used, to evaluate the methods to assess HACS, to assess the validity of those methods, and to estimate the prevalence of HACS. Database search resulted in 34 included studies. Forty different definition references were used to define HACS. This review uncovered twenty quantitative methods to assess HACS, including four questionnaires and sixteen quantitative sensory testing measures. The prevalence of HACS in patients with chronic low back pain was estimated in three studies. The current systematic review highlights that multiple definitions, assessment methods, and prevalence estimates are stated in the literature regarding HACS in patients with chronic low back pain. Most of the assessment methods of HACS are not validated but have been tested for reliability and repeatability. Given the lack of a gold standard to assess HACS, an initial grading system is proposed to standardize clinical and research assessments of HACS in patients with a chronic low back.},

  abstract = {Selective spinal nerve infiltration blocks are used diagnostically in patients with chronic low back pain radiating into the leg. Generally, a segmental nerve block is considered successful if the pain is reduced substantially. Hypesthesia and elicited paresthesias coinciding with the presumed segmental level are used as controls. The interpretation depends on a standard dermatomal map. However, it is not clear if this interpretation is reliable enough, because standard dermatomal maps do not show the overlap of neighboring dermatomes. The goal of the present study is to establish if dissimilarities exist between areas of hypesthesia, spontaneous pain reported by the patient, pain reduction by local anesthetics, and paresthesias elicited by sensory electrostimulation. A secondary goal is to determine to what extent the interpretation is improved when the overlaps of neighboring dermatomes are taken into account. Patients suffering from chronic low back pain with pain radiating into the leg underwent lumbosacral segmental nerve root blocks at subsequent levels on separate days. Lidocaine (2%, 0.5 mL) mixed with radiopaque fluid (0.25 mL) was injected after verifying the target location using sensory and motor electrostimulation. Sensory changes (pinprick method), paresthesias (reported by the patient), and pain reduction (Numeric Rating Scale) were reported. Hypesthesia and paresthesias were registered in a standard dermatomal map and in an adapted map which included overlap of neighboring dermatomes. The relationships between spinal level of injection, extent of hypesthesia, location of paresthesias, and corresponding dermatome were assessed quantitatively. Comparison of the results between both dermatomal maps was done by paired t-tests. After inclusion, data were processed for 40 segmental nerve blocks (L2-S1) performed in 29 patients. Pain reduction was achieved in 43%. Hypesthetic areas showed a large variability in size and location, and also in comparison to paresthesias. Mean hypesthetic area amounted 2.7 +/- 1.4 (+/- SD: range, 0 to 6; standard map) and 3.6 +/- 1.8 (0 to 6; adapted map; P <.001) dermatomes. In these cases, hypesthesia in the corresponding dermatome was found in 80% (standard map) and 88% of the cases (adapted map, not significant). Paresthesias occurring in the corresponding dermatome were found in 80% (standard map) compared with 98% (adapted map, P <.001). In 85% (standard map) and 88% (adapted map), spontaneous pain was present in the dermatome corresponding to the level of local anesthetic injection. In 55% (standard map) versus 75% (adapted map, P <.005), a combination of spontaneous pain, hypesthesia, and paresthesias was found in the corresponding dermatome. Hypesthetic areas determined after lumbosacral segmental nerve blocks show a large variability in size and location compared with elicited paresthesias. Confirmation of an adequately performed segmental nerve block, determined by coexistence of hypesthesia, elicited paresthesias and pain in the presumed dermatome, is more reliable when the overlap of neighboring dermatomes is taken into account.},

This information can influence their treatment expectation and should align with contemporary biopsychosocial (BPS) understanding of pain. It is unclear whether Dutch websites in the fields of rehabilitation and anaesthesiology align with the BPS model. The aim of this study is to assess the BPS content about non-specific neck, back, and chronic pain in Dutch rehabilitation and anaesthesiology websites. All Dutch rehabilitation and anaesthesiology webpages were potentially eligible for inclusion. All webpages focusing on the topics of neck, back, and chronic pain were included. BPS content analyses were performed according to a standardised rating method with criteria for biomedical, limited-, and reasonably BPS. Analyses were performed separately for specialisms, and for the three topics. Additionally, frequency of nocebo words usage on the websites is explored. A total of 71 webpages were included, of which 42 (59.2%) were rehabilitation, 28 (39.4%) were anaesthesiology webpages, and 1 webpage described both. Across all webpages, 7 (9.7%) were rated as biomedical, 54 (75.0%) limited BPS, and 11 (15.3%) reasonably BPS. Differences between specialisms were not significantly different ( Majority of the anaesthesiology and rehabilitation webpages (84.7%) did not achieve a "reasonable biopsychosocial" rate. Improvements are particularly needed in describing pain as a universal and/or normal phenomenon experienced by most individuals, as well as in explaining how an individual's environment influences their thoughts, emotions, and behaviours regarding pain perception.},

  abstract = {Patients with the genetic blistering skin condition epidermolysis bullosa (EB) report severe pain as a consequence of skin and mucous membrane lesions including blisters, wounds, and scars. Adequate symptom alleviation is not often achieved using conventional pharmacologic interventions. Finding novel approaches to pain care in EB is imperative to improve the quality of life of patients living with EB. There are several anecdotal reports on the use of cannabinoid-based medicines (CBMs) by EB patients to reduce the burden of symptoms. However, controlled clinical investigations assessing these reported effects are lacking. As the pain quality "unpleasantness" delineates EB pain, we hypothesize the modulation of affective pain processing in the brain by way of intervention with CBMs comprising the cannabinoids Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol-objectified by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The C4EB study is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover trial. Adult patients with the diagnosis epidermolysis bullosa, reporting chronic pain will be eligible to participate. Following baseline measurements, participants will be randomized to receive the sublingually administered interventions placebo and Transvamix® in forward or reversed orders, each for two weeks and separated by a washout. The primary outcome is the difference in numeric rating scale pain scores between grouped interventions, using affective descriptors within the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2. Secondary outcomes include pain self-efficacy, concomitant analgesic medication-use and adverse events. Additionally, fMRI will be employed to assess brain connectivity related to neuroanatomic pain circuits at baseline, placebo and Transvamix® interventions. The study was approved by the ethical committee at the University Medical Center of Groningen in the Netherlands. Results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

These data can then be evaluated by the anaesthesiologist; this is called the 'paper-based' preoperative evaluation. This method does require the conscientious cooperation between anaesthesiologists and surgeons; it should be clear which patients are eligible, what type of anaesthetic technique should be used, how the patient should be informed and how the informed consent is obtained. In our opinion, this paper-based evaluation combines safety and efficiency with patient-friendliness. It should be anchored in current guidelines to ensure quality.},

Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify possible predictors for the CSI score in 2890 patients with chronic pain. The CSI score is associated with all independent factors and has a low association with pain severity in women and a low association with pain severity, age, and body mass index in men.

Possible interventions are therapeutic selective nerve root block or pulsed radiofrequency. Central pain sensitisation is not directly assessable in humans and therefore the term 'human assumed central sensitisation' (HACS) is proposed. The possible existence and degree of sensitisation associated with pain mechanisms assumed present in the human central nervous system, its role in the chronification of pain and its interaction with diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are largely unknown in patients with CLBPr. The aim of quantitative sensory testing (QST) is to estimate quantitatively the presence of HACS and accumulating evidence suggest that a subset of patients with CLBPr have facilitated responses to a range of QST tests.The aims of this study are to identify HACS in patients with CLBPr, to determine associations with the effect of selective nerve root blocks and compare outcomes of HACS in patients to healthy volunteers. A prospective observational study including 50 patients with CLBPr. Measurements are performed before diagnostic and therapeutic nerve root block interventions and at 4 weeks follow-up. Data from patients will be compared with those of 50 sex-matched and age-matched healthy volunteers. The primary study parameters are the outcomes of QST and the Central Sensitisation Inventory. Statistical analyses to be performed will be analysis of variance.

Most of the input provided to train these systems is based on patient-reported outcome measures. However, with the appearance of electronic health records (EHRs), additional qualitative data on reasons for referrals and patients' goals become available for DSSs. Currently, no decision support tools cover a wide range of biopsychosocial factors, including referral letter information to help clinicians triage patients to the optimal LBP treatment. The objective of this study was to investigate the added value of including qualitative data from EHRs and referral letters to the accuracy of a quantitative DSS for patients with LBP. A retrospective study was conducted in a clinical cohort of Dutch patients with LBP. Patients filled out a baseline questionnaire about demographics, pain, disability, work status, quality of life, medication, psychosocial functioning, comorbidity, history, and duration of pain. Referral reasons and patient requests for help (patient goals) were extracted via natural language processing (NLP) and enriched in the data set. For decision support, these data were considered independent factors for triage to neurosurgery, anesthesiology, rehabilitation, or minimal intervention. Support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and multilayer perceptron models were trained for 2 conditions: with and without consideration of the referral letter content. The models' accuracies were evaluated via F1-scores, and confusion matrices were used to predict the treatment path (out of 4 paths) with and without additional referral parameters. Data from 1608 patients were evaluated. The evaluation indicated that 2 referral reasons from the referral letters (for anesthesiology and rehabilitation intervention) increased the F1-score accuracy by up to 19.5% for triaging. The confusion matrices confirmed the results. This study indicates that data enriching by adding NLP-based extraction of the content of referral letters increases the model accuracy of DSSs in suggesting optimal treatments for individual patients with LBP. Overall model accuracies were considered low and insufficient for clinical application.},

A current literature review is warranted, however, given the complexity of LM morphology and the inconsistency of anatomical descriptions in the literature. Scoping review of studies on LM morphology including major anatomy atlases. All relevant studies were searched in PubMed (Medline) and EMBASE until June 2019. Anatomy atlases were retrieved from multiple university libraries and online. All studies and atlases were screened for the following LM parameters: location, imaging methods, spine levels, muscle trajectory, muscle thickness, cross-sectional area, and diameter. The quality of the studies and atlases was also assessed using a five-item evaluation system. In all, 303 studies and 19 anatomy atlases were included in this review. In most studies, LM morphology was determined by MRI, ultrasound imaging, or drawings - particularly for levels L4-S1. In 153 studies, LM is described as a superficial muscle only, in 72 studies as a deep muscle only, and in 35 studies as both superficial and deep. Anatomy atlases predominantly depict LM as a deep muscle covered by the erector spinae and thoracolumbar fascia. About 42% of the studies had high quality scores, with 39% having moderate scores and 19% having low scores. The quality of figures in anatomy atlases was ranked as high in one atlas, moderate in 15 atlases, and low in 3 atlases. Anatomical studies of LM exhibit inconsistent findings, describing its location as superficial (50%), deep (25%), or both (12%). This is in sharp contrast to anatomy atlases, which depict LM predominantly as deep muscle. Within the limitations of the self-developed quality-assessment tool, high-quality scores were identified in a majority of studies (42%), but in only one anatomy atlas. We identified a lack of standardization in the depiction and description of LM morphology. This could affect the precise understanding of its role in background and therapy in LBP patients. Standardization of research methodology on LM morphology is recommended. Anatomy atlases should be updated on LM morphology.},

Based on current knowledge, expert opinions and expertise of the project team, a multifaceted implementation strategy has been developed. This is a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial including nine representative hospitals across The Netherlands. Hospitals are stratified into three groups according to hospital type and geographical location and randomized in terms of the period for receipt of the intervention. All adult surgical patients meeting the inclusion criteria are assessed for patient outcomes. The implementation strategy includes education, audit and feedback, organizational interventions (e.g., local embedding of the guidelines), team-directed interventions (e.g., multi-professional team training), reminders, as well as patient-mediated interventions (e.g., patient safety cards). To tailor the implementation activities, we developed a questionnaire to identify barriers for effective guideline adherence, based on (a) a theoretical framework for classifying barriers and facilitators, (b) an instrument for measuring determinants of innovations, and (c) 19 semi-structured interviews with perioperative key professionals. Primary outcome is guideline adherence measured at the hospital (i.e., cluster) and patient levels by a set of perioperative Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), which was developed parallel to the perioperative guidelines. Secondary outcomes at the patient level are in-hospital complications, postoperative wound infections and mortality, length of hospital stay, and unscheduled transfer to the intensive care unit, non-elective readmission to the hospital and unplanned reoperation, all within 30 days after the initial surgery. Also, patient safety culture and team climate will be studied as potential determinants. Finally, a process evaluation is conducted to identify the compliance with the implementation strategy, as well as an economic evaluation to assess the costs. Data sources are registered clinical data and surveys. There is no form of blinding. The perioperative setting is an unexplored area with respect to implementation issues. This study is expected to yield important new evidence about the effects of a multifaceted approach on guideline adherence in the perioperative care setting. Dutch trial registry: NTR3568.},

We investigated whether muscle loading in chronic CRPS-1 patients is associated with impairments in muscle circulation of the forearm of the affected limb. Thirty patients with chronic CRPS-1 unilaterally affecting their upper limbs, and 30 age-matched and sex-matched control participants were included in this study. Local muscle blood flow and hemoglobin oxygenation were measured by near infrared spectroscopy within the muscles of the forearm at rest, after 1-minute isometric handgrip exercises, and after arterial occlusion. Main outcome parameters were: local muscle blood flow, O2 consumption (mVO2), and postischemic reoxygenation (ReOx). We found no differences in baseline muscle blood flow, mVO2, and ReOx between the affected CRPS-1, unaffected CRPS-1, and control arms. After exercise, mVO2 of the affected CRPS-1 arms was not different from the clinically unaffected CRPS-1 arms. Furthermore, in comparison with the control arms, unaffected CRPS-1 arms showed no difference in mVO2 or ReOx. Muscle loading does not seems to be related to impairments in muscle oxygen uptake in forearm muscles of upper limbs affected by chronic CRPS-1. Our results suggest that exercise therapy can be safely used in physiotherapeutic training programs for chronic CRPS-1 of the upper limb.},

Duration and quality of analgesia and motor block increased with the concentration of ropivacaine. Ropivacaine 1.0% provided a longer duration of analgesia and motor block, more intense motor block and more patients with satisfactory analgesia than 0.5% bupivacaine. More patients treated with the higher concentrations of ropivacaine required treatment for hypotension and bradycardia.},

In a prospective, observer-blind study, 60 patients scheduled for thoracic surgery received a thoracic epidural catheter for 3 days. The patients were randomly assigned by lot to one of two groups: a low-volume (LV) group (bupivacaine 0.75% with sufentanil 4 micrograms/mL, 1.0-1.3 mL/h), or a high-volume (HV) group (bupivacaine 0.125% with sufentanil 0.7 microgram/mL, 6-8 mL/h). On the first postoperative day significantly more patients in the LV group needed one or more epidural bolus injections because they experienced pain at rest (P < 0.05). On the second and third postoperative days there were no differences in bolus injections. Significantly more patients in the HV group did not require an extra epidural bolus injection (P < 0.05). There were no differences in the number of patients experiencing pain at exercise or in the incidence of side effects. A difference was found between both groups in the mean preoperative PaCO2 value (P < 0.05) and also for the PaCO2 values on Day 1 versus the preoperative values within the group (P < 0.05). On the first postoperative day the analgesic effects of a sufentanil/bupivacaine mixture at a high thoracic epidural level can be improved when injected at a continuous high-volume rate compared with a dose-equivalent continuous low-volume rate. This is true for pain at rest; for pain at exercise, there were no differences.},

This study aimed to examine whether pre-operative olanzapine, as a prophylactic anti-emetic added to intra-operative dexamethasone, ondansetron and total intravenous anaesthesia, reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting. We performed a multiply-blinded randomised controlled trial in patients aged 18-60 years with cancer at high risk of postoperative nausea or vomiting (three or four risk factors according to the Apfel criteria) plus a previous history of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Patients were allocated at random to receive 10 mg olanzapine or placebo orally 1 h before surgery in addition to a two-drug regimen (dexamethasone and ondansetron) and propofol anaesthesia to prevent postoperative nausea or vomiting. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting in the first 24 h after surgery. In total, 100 patients were enrolled; 47 in the olanzapine group and 49 in the control group completed the study. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. The incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting in the first 24 h after surgery was lower in the olanzapine group (12/47, 26%) than in the control group (31/49, 63%) (p = 0.008, RR 0.40 (95%CI 0.21-0.79)). Adding pre-operative oral olanzapine to intra-operative dexamethasone and ondansetron was highly effective in reducing the risk of postoperative nausea or vomiting in the first 24 hours after surgery in patients with a previous history of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and at least three Apfel risk factors for postoperative nausea or vomiting.},

The tool enables monitoring and benchmarking perioperative safety performance across departments and hospitals, covering international patient safety goals. Nineteen perioperative patient safety observation topics were selected from Dutch perioperative patient safety guidelines, which also cover international patient safety goals. All items that measured these selected topics were then extracted from available local observation checklists of the participating hospitals. Experts individually prioritized the best measurement items per topic in an initial written Delphi round. The second (face to face) Delphi round resulted in consensus on the content of SPOT, after which the measurable elements (MEs) per topic were defined. Finally, the tool was piloted in eight hospitals for measurability, applicability, improvement potential, discriminatory capacity and feasibility. The pilot test showed good measurability for all 19 patient safety topics (range of 8-291 MEs among topics), with good applicability (median 97 (range 11·8-100) per cent). The overall improvement potential appeared to be good (median 89 (range 72·5-100) per cent), and at topic level the tool showed good discriminatory capacity (variation 27·5 per cent, range in compliance 72·5-100 per cent). Overall scores showed relatively little variation between the participating hospitals (variation 13 per cent, range in compliance 83-96 per cent). All eight auditors considered SPOT a straightforward and easy-to-use tracer tool. A comprehensive tool to measure safety of care was developed and validated using a systematic, stepwise method, enabling hospitals to monitor, benchmark and improve perioperative safety performance.},

Patients in whom a bupivacaine dose of 8 mg or smaller was administered had significantly higher conversion rate (3/61 (4.9%) patients and 12/1191 (1.0%) patients, respectively; p < 0.05.). The relative risk of conversion with a 8 mg dose or lower is 4.88 (95% CI 1.41 - 16.85).

The socioeconomic burden of LBP is very high. A minority of patients visit secondary or tertiary care because of severe and long-lasting complaints. This subgroup may account for a major part of disability and costs, yet could potentially gain most from treatment. Currently, little is known about the personal and societal burden in patients with chronic complex LBP visiting secondary/tertiary care. Baseline data were acquired through patient-reported questionnaires and health insurance claims. Primary outcomes were LBP impact (Impact Stratification, range 8-50), functioning (Pain Disability Index, PDI; 0-70), quality of life (EuroQol-5D, EQ5D; -0.33 to 1.00), work ability (Work Ability Score, WAS; 0-10), work participation, productivity costs (Productivity Cost Questionnaire), and healthcare costs 1 year before baseline. Healthcare costs were compared with matched primary and secondary care LBP samples. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. In total, 1502 patients (age 46.3 ± 12.8 years, 57% female) were included. Impact Stratification was 35.2 ± 7.5 with severe impact (≥35) for 58% of patients. PDI was 38.2 ± 14.1, EQ5D 0.39 (interquartile range, IQR: 0.17-0.72); WAS 4.0 (IQR: 1.0-6.0) and 17% were permanently work-disabled.

Productivity loss was estimated at &OV0556;4315 per patient (95% CI: 3898-4688) during 6 months. In patients seeking multidisciplinary spine care, the personal and societal impact of LBP is very high. Specifically, quality of life and work ability are poor and health care costs are twice as high compared to patients seeking primary LBP care. 3.},

Nine hospitals participated in this unblinded, superiority, stepped-wedge, cluster RCT in patients with major noncardiac surgery (mortality risk ≥1%). IMPROVE consisted of educational activities, audit and feedback, reminders, organisational, team-directed, and patient-mediated activities. The primary outcome of the study was guideline adherence measured by nine patient safety indicators on the process (stop moments from the composite STOP bundle, and timely administration of antibiotics) and on the structure of perioperative care. Secondary safety outcomes included in-hospital complications, postoperative wound infections, mortality, length of hospital stay, and unplanned care. Data were analysed for 1934 patients. The IMPROVE programme improved one stop moment: 'discharge from recovery room' (+16%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9-23%). This stop moment was related to decreased mortality (-3%; 95% CI, -4% to -1%), fewer complications (-8%; 95% CI, -13% to -3%), and fewer unscheduled transfers to the ICU (-6%; 95% CI, -9% to -3%). IMPROVE negatively affected one other stop moment - 'discharge from the hospital' - possibly because of the limited resources of hospitals to improve all stop moments together. Mixed implementation effects of IMPROVE were found. We found some positive associations between guideline adherence and patient safety (i.e. mortality, complications, and unscheduled transfers to the ICU) except for the timely administration of antibiotics.

Pain (absence or presence of neuro-pathic pain) was assessed independently by two physicians and compared with BSE (measurements of touch [finger, brush], heat, cold, pricking [safety pin, von Frey hair], and vibration). The NASQ paradigm (pressure algometry, electrical pain thresholds, and conditioned pain modulation) was assessed in 58 patients to generate new insights. BSE revealed a low association of differences between patients with either absent or present NePC: heat, cold, and pricking sensations with a von Frey hair were statistically significantly less common in patients with present NePC. NASQ did not reveal any differences between patients with and without an NePC. Currently, a standardized BSE appears to be more useful than the NASQ paradigm when distinguishing between patients with and without an NePC.},

Patients with CLBP have limited functioning and participation. Theoretically, physical functioning in patients with CLBP can plausibly be linked to CS; however, evidence to explain such association is scarce. Moreover, there is no gold standard for CS diagnosis. The objectives of the study are: (1) to analyse the association between instruments assessing reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS; (2) to analyse whether reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS are associated with functioning measurement outcomes; and (3) to analyse whether changes (between baseline and discharge) in reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS are related to changes in each of the functioning measurement outcomes. A cross-sectional and longitudinal observational study is performed with measurements taken at baseline and discharge of an interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme. A sample size of 110 adult patients with CLBP has been calculated for the study. CS measurements are: Central Sensitisation Inventory, quantitative sensory testing and heart rate variability. Functioning measurements are: lifting capacity, maximal aerobic capacity, accelerometry and reported functioning. Statistical analyses to be performed are: (1) correlation between CS measurements, (2) multiple regression between functioning (dependent variable) and CS measurements (independent variable), and (3) multiple regression between changes in scores of functioning (dependent variable) and CS measurements (independent variable), and corrected for sex and age. The study obtained the clearance to its implementation from the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen in July 2017.

  abstract = {A 98-year-old woman presented for a hemiarthroplasty of the left hip. Because of her age and cardiac and pulmonary co-existing diseases we decided to provide adequate regional anesthesia by continuous spinal anesthesia. Fragmented doses of isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% were administered through a system consisting of a spinal catheter connected to an antimicrobial filter. After an uneventful surgical procedure, prior to removal of the catheter, this system was flushed with 10 mL of normal saline in order to try to prevent post-dural-puncture headache. After arrival at the postanesthesia care unit and fifteen minutes after removal of the catheter the patient suffered an unexpected high thoracic sensory blockade and hypotension requiring treatment. The continuous spinal anesthesia technique can be used in selected cases to be able to administer local anesthetic agents in a slow and controlled manner to reach the desired effect. The risk of post-dural-puncture headache using this technique in elderly patients is very low and therefore precludes the need to try to prevent it. We have described a potentially dangerous complication of flushing a bupivacaine-filled system into the spinal canal of an elderly patient resulting in an undesirable high sensory blockade.},

  abstract = {To improve perioperative patient safety, hospitals are implementing evidence-based perioperative safety guidelines. To facilitate this process, it is important to provide insight into current practice. For this purpose, we aimed to develop patient safety indicators. The RAND-modified Delphi method was used to develop a set of patient safety indicators based on the perioperative guidelines. First, a core group of experts systematically selected recommendations from the guidelines. Then, an expert panel of representative professionals appraised the recommendations against safety criteria, prioritized them and reached consensus about 11 patient safety indicators. Measurability, applicability, improvement potential (based on current practice) and discriminatory capacity of each indicator were pilot tested in eight hospitals. Seven structure, two process and two outcome indicators were developed covering the entire perioperative care process. Most indicators showed good applicability (N=11), improvement potential (N=6) and discriminatory capacity (N=7). Four indicators were difficult to measure. Improvement opportunities concerned the use of perioperative stops, timely administration of antibiotics, availability of protocols on perioperative anticoagulants and on prospective risk analysis of medical equipment, presence of a surveillance system for postoperative wound infections, and a morbidity and mortality registration. Using a systematic, stepwise method 11 patient safety indicators were developed for internal assessment, monitoring and improvement of the perioperative care process. There was large variation in guideline adherence between and within hospitals, identifying opportunities for improvement in the quality of perioperative care.},

The aim of this study was to review the literature on safety differences between patients from minority ethnic groups and those from the ethnic majority undergoing surgery. PubMed, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library and Embase were searched using predefined inclusion criteria for available studies from January 1990 to January 2013. After quality assessment, the study data were organized on the basis of outcome, statistical significance and the direction of the observed effects. Relative risks for mortality were calculated. After screening 3105 studies, 26 studies were identified. Nine of these 26 studies showed statistically significant higher mortality rates for patients from minority ethnic groups. Meta-analysis demonstrated a greater risk of mortality for these patients compared with patients from the Caucasian majority in studies performed both in North America (risk ratio 1·22, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·05 to 1·42) and outside (risk ratio 2·25, 1·40 to 3·62). For patients from minority groups, the length of hospital or intensive care unit stay was significantly longer in five studies, and complication rates were significantly higher in ten. Methods used to identify patient ethnicity were not described in 14 studies. Patients from minority ethnic groups, in North America and elsewhere, have an increased risk of perioperative death and complications. More insight is needed into the causes of ethnic disparities to pursue safer perioperative care for patients of minority ethnicity.},

  abstract = {Continuous sedation, contrary to euthanasia, has been increasingly accepted among medical professionals worldwide. In the Netherlands, a national guideline for continuous palliative sedation has been developed to contribute to the quality of palliative sedation practice. The present follow-up study investigated whether the practice of continuous sedation has changed after the introduction of this guideline. This study compared the practice of continuous sedation before and after the introduction of the guideline on December 7, 2005. A baseline measurement was performed between February 1, 2003, and May 1, 2005, with an enrollment of 492 physicians (medical specialists, general practitioners, and nursing home physicians). From January 1 to June 30, 2007, after the introduction of a national guideline for palliative sedation, a follow-up study was performed with the respondents of the baseline study. Physicians were asked to report on their last case of deep and continuous sedation in the past 12 months. This study reports the results of the follow-up study and compares them to the results of the baseline study. The response rate was 69.3% (n = 341). Of these physicians, 160 reported a last case of continuous sedation in both the baseline and the follow-up studies. Physicians reported a significant increase in patient involvement in decision making, from 72.3% to 82.2%. Pain remained the most often reported reason to start sedation, whereas exhaustion as a reason for sedation increased. The use of benzodiazepines increased from 69.9% to 90.4%. In the first and second measurements, symptom-directed treatment during sedation was applied in 56% to 58% of the cases. In the second period, there was more often an explicit decision to not give artificial hydration during sedation (78.8% vs 56.3%). Of the physicians, 34.2% were convinced that sedation shortened the life of the patient because of dehydration. After the introduction of the guideline, physicians reported that changes in palliative sedation practice conform to the recommendations of this guideline. For example, benzodiazepines were used for sedation more frequently than before and patient involvement in the decision-making process improved. Possible effects of dehydration and the large variation in symptom-directed treatment during sedation deserve careful attention.},

Systematic fluoroscopic analysis of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle tip location has not been published to date. Study aims include assessment of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle position during fluoroscopy-assisted blocks. Patients scheduled for L4, L5, and S1 blocks were included in this prospective observational study. Under fluoroscopy and electrostimulation, they received 0.5 mL of a mixture containing lidocaine 5 mg and iohexol 75 mg. X-rays with needle tip and contrast were scored for no epidural spread (grade 0), local spread epidurally (grade 1), or to adjacent nerve roots (grade 2). Sixty-five patients were analyzed for epidural spread, 62 for needle position. Grade 1 epidural spread occurred in 47% of L4 and 28% of L5 blocks and grade 2 spread in 3 blocks (5%; L5 n = 1, S1 n = 2). For lumbar blocks, the needle was most frequently found in the lateral upper half of the intervertebral foramen. Epidural spread occurred more frequently with medial needle positions (P = .06). The findings suggest (P = .06) that the risk of grade 1 and 2 lumbar epidural spread, which results in decreased SNRB selectivity, is greater with medial needle positions in the intervertebral foramen. The variability in anatomic position of the dorsal root ganglion necessitates electrostimulation to guide SNRB in addition to fluoroscopy.},

Patients' pain was classified by two independent (pain-)physicians as the gold standard. The analysis was initially performed on the outcomes of those patients (n = 228 out of 291) in whom both physicians agreed in their pain classification. Compared to the gold standard the DN4 had a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 76%. The DN4-symptoms (seven interview items) solely resulted in a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 67%. For the DN4-signs (three examination items) it was respectively 75% and 75%. In conclusion, because it seems that the DN4 helps to identify a neuropathic pain component in a consecutive population of patients with chronic pain in a moderate way, a comprehensive (physical-) examination by the physician is still obligate.},

Previous studies indicate preoperative anxiety as a risk factor for developing CPSP, yet no high-quality review exists. This study aims to systematically review the relationship between increased preoperative anxiety and the incidence of new CPSP. Four databases were used to identify relevant studies for a systematic review and meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria included adult patients undergoing surgical procedures under general anaesthesia, measuring preoperative anxiety with validated tools, and postoperative pain at least 3 months after surgery. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and a risk of bias analysis was performed. Of the 233 studies retrieved, 26 studies were included in the systematic review. Following risk of bias analysis, 23 papers were included in the meta-analysis. A correlation was found between preoperative anxiety and CPSP, with a standardised mean difference of 0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.20-0.41). High heterogeneity was observed, which was attributed to several possible confounding factors. Subgroup analysis did not alter this outcome. When translating the outcome to a relevant scale, we observed an increase in numeric rating scale pain of 0.34 for patients experiencing preoperative anxiety. There is moderate-quality evidence indicating a positive association between preoperative anxiety and CPSP, where an increase in preoperative anxiety correlates with an increased incidence of CPSP. More research is needed to identify specific patients that would benefit from treating preoperative anxiety and thus potentially preventing CPSP. PROSPERO (CRD42024513479).},

Asymptomatic hypoaesthesia, variable in extent and non-dermatomal in distribution, was present in seven patients at baseline. It appeared to be more extensive and distal with longer duration of pre-existing pain. SNB produced no consistent changes in extent and distribution of hypoaesthetic areas. Change in VNRS did not correlate with the extent of pre-block or post-block hypoaesthesia. No differences in effects were found between lidocaine and ropivacaine. Pre-block assessment of sensory function is essential to assess the net effect of SNBs. In this small study group, SNBs failed to demonstrate uniform or distinct effects on sensory function.},

Inclusion criteria were: participants between 18 and 65 years old with non-specific sub-acute or chronic LBP, minimum average follow-up of > 2 years, and studies had to report at least one of the following outcome measures: disability, quality of life, work participation, or health care utilization. Methodological quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment. Data were extracted, tabulated, and reported thematically. Ninety studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies examined invasive treatments (72%), conservative (21%), or a comparison of both (7%). No natural cohorts were included. Methodological quality was weak (16% of studies), moderate (63%), or strong (21%) and generally improved after 2010. Disability (92%) and pain (86%) outcomes were most commonly reported, followed by work (25%), quality of life (15%), and health care utilization (4%). Most studies reported significant improvement at long-term follow-up (median 51 months, range 26 months-18 years). Only 10 (11%) studies took more than one measurement > 2 year after baseline. Patients with persistent non-specific LBP seem to experience improvement in pain, disability and quality of life years after seeking treatment. However, it remains unclear what factors might have influenced these improvements, and whether they are treatment-related. Studies varied greatly in design, patient population, and methods of data collection. There is still little insight into the long-term natural course of LBP. Additionally, few studies perform repeated measurements during long-term follow-up or report on patient-centered outcomes other than pain or disability.},

We explored the number, nature and causes of voluntarily reported perioperative incidents in order to highlight the areas where further efforts are required to improve patient safety. Data from the Hospital Incident Management System (HIMS), entered in the period from July 2009 to July 2012, were analyzed in a Dutch university hospital. Employees in the perioperatve field filled out a semi-structured digital form of the reporting system. The risk classification of the reported adverse events and 'near misses' was based on the estimated patient consequences and the risk of recurrence, according to national guidelines. Predefined reported incident causes were categorized as human, organizational, technical and patient related. In total, 2,563 incidents (1,300 adverse events and 1,263 'near-miss' events) were reported during 67,360 operations. Reporters were anesthesia, operating room and recovery nurses (37%), ward nurses (31%), physicians (17%), administrative personnel (5%), others (6%) and unmentioned (3%). A total of 414 (16%) adverse events had patient consequences (which affected 0,6% of all surgery patients), estimated as catastrophic in 2, very serious in 34, serious in 105, and marginally serious in 273 cases. Shortcomings in communication was the most frequent reported type of incidents. Non-compliance with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs: instructions, regulations, protocols and guidelines) was reported with 877 (34%) of incident reports. In total, 1,194 (27%) voluntarily reported causes were SOP-related, mainly human-based (79%) and partially organization-based (21%). SOP-related incidents were not associated with more patient consequences than other voluntarily reported incidents. Furthermore 'mistake or forgotten' (15%) and 'communication problems' (11%) were frequently reported causes of incidents. The analysis of voluntarily reported perioperative incidents identified an association between perioperative patient safety problems and human failure, such as SOP non-compliance, mistakes, forgetting, and shortcomings in communication. The data suggest that professionals themselves indicate that SOP compliance in combination with other human failures provide room for improvement.},

The aim of this study was to examine changes in health care costs after multidisciplinary spine care in patients with complex chronic back pain (CBP), to analyze the predictive value of patient and disease characteristics on health care costs, and to study the potential impact of biases concerning the use of real world data. Due to high direct and indirect societal costs of back pain there is a need for interventions that can assist in reducing the economic burden on patients and society. All patients referred to a university-based spine center insured at a major health care insurer in the Netherlands were invited. Personal and disease-related data were collected at baseline. Health care costs were retrieved from the health care insurer from 2 years before to 2 years after intervention. Repeated measures analysis of variances were calculated to study changes in health care costs after intervention. Multivariable regression analyses and cluster robust fixed effect models were applied to predict characteristics on health care costs. To study regression to the mean, a fixed effect model was calculated comparing 2 years before and 2 years post-intervention. In total 428,158 declarations during 4.6 years were filed by 997 participants (128,666 considered CBP-related). CBP-related costs significantly increased during the intervention period and reduced 2 years after the intervention. Total health care costs kept rising. The intervention was associated with a 21% to 34% (P < 0.01) reduction in costs depending on the model used. Reduction in costs was related to being male and lower body mass index. This study suggests that reduction in CBP-related health care utilization in patients with complex CBP can be achieved after a multidisciplinary spine intervention. The results are robust to controlling for background characteristics and are unlikely to be fully driven by regression to the mean. 4.},

Therefore, 20 patients, of which 19 finished the complete protocol, with chronic lumbosacral radicular pain without neurological deficits underwent segmental nerve blocks at L4 with both lidocaine and ropivacaine. Pain intensity scores (verbal numeric rating scale; VNRS) and the maximum voluntary muscle force (MVMF; using a dynamometer expressed in newtons) of the tibialis anterior and quadriceps femoris muscles were measured on the painful side and on the control side. The median VNRS decrease was 4.0 (P < 0.00001; Wilcoxon's signed rank test), without significant differences between ropivacaine and lidocaine (Mann-Whitney U-test). A difference in effect on MVMF was found for affected versus control side (P = 0.016; Tukey test). Multiple regression revealed a significant negative correlation for change in VNRS score versus change in median MVMF (Spearman R = -0.48: P = 0.00001). This study demonstrates that in patients with unilateral chronic low back pain radiating to the leg, pain reduction induced by local anesthetic segmental nerve (L4) block is associated with increased quadriceps femoris and tibialis anterior MVMF, without differences for lidocaine and ropivacaine.},

The aim of this study is to determine the LM-sonoanatomy by comparing high-resolution reconstructions from a 3-D digital spine compared to standard LM-ultrasonography. An observational study was carried out. From three deeply frozen human tissue blocks of the lumbosacral spine, a large series of consecutive photographs at 78 μm interval were acquired and reformatted into 3-D blocks. This enabled the reconstruction of (semi-)oblique cross-sections that could match US-images obtained from a healthy volunteer. Transverse and oblique short-axis views were compared from the most caudal insertion of LM to L1. Based on the anatomical reconstructions, we could distinguish the LM from the adjacent erector spinae (ES) in the standard US imaging of the lower spine. At the lumbosacral junction, LM is the only dorsal muscle facing the surface. From L5 upwards, the ES progresses from lateral to medial. A clear distinction between deep and superficial LM could not be discerned. We were only able to identify five separate bands between every lumbar spinous processes and the dorsal part of the sacrum in the caudal anatomical cross-sections, but not in the standard US images. The detailed cross-sectional LM-sonoanatomy and reconstructions facilitate the interpretations of standard LM US-imaging, the position of the separate LM-bands, the details of deep interspinal muscles, and demarcation of the LM versus the ES. Guidelines for electrode positioning in EMG studies should be refined to establish reliable and verifiable findings. For clinical practice, this study can serve as a guide for a better characterisation of LM compared to ES and for a more reliable placement of US-probe in biofeedback.},

The aim of this study was to identify treatment response trajectories in patients with low back pain (LBP) during and after multidisciplinary care in a tertiary spine center, and to examine baseline patient characteristics that can distinguish trajectories. Treatment response is often heterogeneous between patients with LBP. Knowledge on key characteristics that are associated with courses of disability could identify patients at risk for less favorable outcome. This knowledge will help improve shared decision-making. Adult patients with LBP completed questionnaires on disability (Pain Disability Index) and LBP impact (Impact Stratification of the National Institutes of Health minimal dataset) at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months' follow-up. Latent class analyses were applied to identify trajectories of disability and LBP impact. Baseline sociodemographic and clinical patient characteristics were compared between trajectory subgroups. Follow-up was available for 996 patients on disability and 707 patients on LBP impact. Six trajectories were identified for both outcome measures. Three disability trajectories remained stable at distinct levels of severity (68% of patients) and three trajectories showed patterns of recovery (32%). For LBP impact there was one stable trajectory (17%), two slightly improving (59%), two recovering (15%), and one with a pattern of recovery and relapse (15%). Significant differences between trajectories were observed for almost all baseline patient characteristics. On average, patients show moderate improvements in disability and LBP impact 2 years after visiting a multidisciplinary tertiary spine center. However, latent class analyses revealed that most patients belong to subgroups experiencing stable levels of disability and LBP impact. Differences in baseline patient characteristics were mostly associated with baseline levels of functioning, instead of (un)favorable outcome during follow-up. 2.},

The aims of this systematic review were to identify non-invasive objective markers of HACS and the instruments to assess these markers in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). A systematic review was conducted with the following inclusion criteria: (1) adults, (2) diagnosed with FM, and (3) markers and instruments for HACS had to be non-invasive. Data were subsequently extracted, and studies were assessed for risk of bias using the quality assessment tools developed by the National Institute of Health. 78 studies (n= 5234 participants) were included and the findings were categorized in markers identified to assess peripheral and central manifestations of HACS. The identified markers for peripheral manifestations of HACS, with at least moderate evidence, were pain after-sensation decline rates, mechanical pain thresholds, pressure pain threshold, sound 'pressure' pain threshold, cutaneous silent period, slowly repeated evoked pain sensitization and nociceptive flexion reflex threshold. The identified markers for central manifestations of HACS were efficacy of conditioned pain modulation with pressure pain conditioning and brain perfusion analysis. Instruments to assess these markers are: pin-prick stimulators, cuff-algometry, repetitive pressure stimulation using a pressure algometer, sound, electrodes and neuroimaging techniques. This review provides an overview of non-invasive markers and instruments for the assessment of HACS in patients with FM. Implementing these findings into clinical settings may help to identify HACS in patients with FM.},

Longitudinal validity of the total minimal dataset and the subscale Impact Stratification are unknown. Total outcome scores on the NIH minimal dataset, Dutch Language Version, were calculated ranging from 0 to 100 points with higher scores representing worse functioning. Responsiveness and MCIC were determined with an anchor-based method, calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) and by determining the optimal cut-off point. Smallest detectable change (SDC) was calculated as a parameter of measurement error. In total 223 patients with CLBP were included. Mean total score on the NIH minimal dataset was 44 ± 14 points at baseline. The total outcome score was responsive to change with an AUC of 0.84. MCIC was 14 points with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity 82%, and SDC was 23 points. Mean total score on Impact Stratification (scale 8-50) was 34.4 ± 7.4 points at baseline, with an AUC of 0.91, an MCIC of 7.5 with a sensitivity 96% of and specificity of 78%, and an SDC of 14 points. The longitudinal validity of the NIH minimal dataset is adequate. An improvement of 14 points in total outcome score and 7.5 points in Impact Stratification can be interpreted as clinically important in individual patients. However, MCIC depends on baseline values and the method that is chosen to determine the optimal cut-off point. Furthermore, measurement error is larger than the MCIC. This means that individual change scores should be interpreted with caution. 2.},

English-speaking EB patients or caregivers completed an online international, anonymous, cross-sectional survey regarding CBM use. Respondents reported the types of CBMs, subsequent effects including perceived EB symptom alteration, changes in medication use, and side effects. Seventy-one EB patients from five continents reported using or having used CBMs to treat their EB. Missing question responses ranged between 0 (0%) and 33 (46%). Most used more than one CBM preparation (mean: 2.4 ± 1.5) and route of administration (mean: 2.1 ± 1.1). Topical and ingested were the most common routes. Pain and pruritus were reported retrospectively to decrease by 3 points (scale: 0-10; p < 0.001 for both) after CBM use. Most reported that CBM use improved their overall EB symptoms (95%), pain (94%), pruritus (91%) and wound healing (81%). Most participants (79%) reported decreased use of pain medications. The most common side-effect was dry mouth (44%). CBMs improve the perception of pain, pruritus, wound healing, and well-being in EB patients and reduced concomitant medication use. Nevertheless, a direct relation between the use of CBMs and reduction of the above-mentioned symptoms cannot be proven by these data. Therefore, future controlled studies using pharmaceutically standardised CBM preparations in EB are warranted to delineate the risks and benefits of CBMs.},

In addition to rating the statements on a five-point Likert scale (which were classified into the seven categories of the framework: factors relating to the intervention, society, implementation, organization, professional, patients, and social factors), respondents were invited to rank their three most important barriers in a separate, extra open-ended question. Ninety-five professionals (41%) completed the questionnaire. Fifteen statements (26%) were considered to be barriers, relating to social factors ( We identified a wide range of barriers that are believed to hinder the use of the perioperative safety guidelines, while an integrated information system and local data collection and feedback will also be necessary to engage perioperative teams.

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the methods used to identify perioperative patient safety risks prospectively, and to describe the risk areas targeted, the quality characteristics and feasibility of methods. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were searched, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. All studies describing the development and results of prospective methods to identify perioperative patient safety risks were included and assessed on methodological quality. Exclusion criteria were interventional studies, studies targeting one specific issue, studies reporting on structural factors relating to fundamental hospital items, and non-original or case studies. The electronic search resulted in 16 708 publications, but only 20 were included for final analysis, describing five prospective risk-assessment methods. Direct observation was used in most studies, often in combination. Direct (16 studies) and indirect (4 studies) observations identified (potential) adverse events (P)AEs, process flow disruptions, poor protocol compliance and poor practice performance. (Modified) Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA™) (5 studies) targeted potential process flow disruption failures, and direct (P)AE surveillance (3 studies) identified (P)AEs prospectively. Questionnaires (3 studies) identified poor protocol compliance, surgical flow disturbances and patients' willingness to ask questions about their care. Overall, quality characteristics and feasibility of the methods were poorly reported. The direct (in-person) observation appears to be the primary prospective risk-assessment method that currently may best help to target perioperative hazards. This is a reliable method and covers a broad spectrum of perioperative risk areas.},

  abstract = {The antiemetic effectiveness of olanzapine, as a prophylactic off-label antiemetic drug, for Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) is unknown. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, the authors evaluate the efficacy and side effects of olanzapine as a prophylactic antiemetic in adult patients who undergo general anesthesia and assess adverse effects. A systematic search was done on electronic bibliographic databases in July 2023. Randomized controlled trials of olanzapine as a prophylactic antiemetic for PONV in adults who underwent general anesthesia were included. The authors excluded non-RCTs and retracted studies. The authors set no date of publication or language limits. The outcomes were the incidence of PONV within 24 h postoperatively and the safety of olanzapine. The risk of bias was assessed according to the tool suggested by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Meta-analysis included 446 adult patients. Olanzapine reduced on average 38 % the incidence of PONV. The estimated risk ratio (95 % CI) of olanzapine versus control was 0.62 (0.42-0.90), p = 0.010, I This systematic review with meta-analysis indicated that olanzapine as a prophylactic antiemetic alone or combined with other antiemetic agents reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, this conclusion must be presented with some degree of uncertainty due to the small number of studies included. There was a lack of any evidence to draw conclusions on side effects.},

The objective was to study the safety and effect of a combination of music and abdominally administered low-frequency vibrations on pain intensity in elderly patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. This trial was an international multicenter, randomized controlled pilot study. Patients at age ≥ 65 years with musculoskeletal pain for ≥ 3 months and a daily pain score ≥ 4 out of 10 were recruited at three centers. They were randomized to receive either a combination of music and low-frequency (20-100 Hz) vibrations administered to the abdomen, or a combination with the same music but with higher frequency (200-300 Hz) vibrations administered to the abdomen. Low-frequency vibrations were expected to result in pain reduction measured with a numeric pain rating scale (NRS). Patients in both groups received eight treatments of the music combined with the vibrations in three weeks. Primary outcomes were safety (Serious Adverse Events) and pain intensity measured at baseline, after the last treatment and at six weeks follow-up. Multilevel linear model analyses were performed to study group and time effects. A total of 45 patients were analyzed according to intention-to-treat principle. After 344 treatments, 1 Adverse Event was found related to the intervention, while 13 Adverse Events were possibly related. A multilevel linear model showed that the interaction effect of group by time did not predict pain intensity (F[1, 45.93] = 0.002, p = 0.97) when comparing pain intensity at baseline, after the last treatment and at follow-up. The combination of music and abdominally administered vibrations was found to be safe and well tolerated by the elderly patients. However, over time, neither the low-frequency treatment group nor the high-frequency treatment group provided clinically meaningful pain relief. There is no evidence that the low-frequency treatment elicited vagal nerve stimulation. The trial was prospectively registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR: NL7606) on 21-03-2019.},

A Self-assessment Instrument for Perioperative Patient Safety (SIPPS) monitoring and benchmarking compliance to safety standards was validated in a multicentre pilot study. A preliminary questionnaire, based on the Dutch perioperative patient safety guidelines and covering international patient safety goals, was evaluated in a first digital RAND Delphi round. The results were used to optimize the questionnaire and design the SIPPS. For measurement and benchmarking purposes, SIPPS was categorized into seven main patient safety domains concerning all care episode phases of the perioperative trajectory. After consensus was reached in a face-to-face Delphi round, SIPPS was pilot-tested in five hospitals for five characteristics: measurability, applicability, improvement potential, discriminatory capacity and feasibility. The results of the first Delphi round showed moderate feasibility for the preliminary questionnaire (81·6 per cent). The pilot test showed good measurability for SIPPS: 99·8 per cent of requested information was assessable. Some 99·9 per cent of SIPPS questions were applicable to the selected respondents. With SIPPS, room for improvement in perioperative patient safety compliance was demonstrated for all hospitals, concerning all safety domains and all care episode phases of the perioperative trajectory (compliance 76·1 per cent). SIPPS showed mixed results for discriminatory capacity. SIPPS showed good feasibility for all items (range 91·9-95·7 per cent). A self-assessment instrument for measuring perioperative patient safety (SIPPS) compliance meeting international standards was validated. With SIPPS, improvement areas for perioperative patient safety and best practices across hospitals could be identified.},

Covert brain infarctions are more frequent than overt strokes and are associated with postoperative delirium, cognitive decline, and cerebrovascular events at 1 year after surgery. Evidence shows that traditional stroke risk factors including older age, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation are also associated with perioperative stroke; previous stroke is the strongest risk factor for perioperative stroke. Increasing evidence also suggests the pathogenic role of perioperative events, such as hypotension, new atrial fibrillation, paradoxical embolism, and bleeding.

Inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL10 and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured in plasma samples pre- and post-operatively. Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOS) was used as screening instrument for POD in the first week after surgery. In case of positive screening, diagnosis of POD was assessed by a clinician. Between 2010 and 2016, plasma samples of 311 patients with median age of 72 years (range 65-89) were collected. A total of 38 (12%) patients developed POD in the first week after surgery. The perioperative increase in plasma levels of IL-10 and NGAL were associated with POD in multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 1.33 [1.09-1.63] P = 0.005 and OR 1.30 [1.03-1.64], P = 0.026, respectively). The biomarkers CRP, IL-1β and IL-6 were not significantly associated with POD. Increased surgery-evoked inflammatory responses of IL-10 and NGAL are associated with the development of POD in older oncological patients.

The aim of this study was to explore inflammatory biomarkers as potential prognostic factors for postoperative complications within 30 days in older patients with cancer. Patients 65 years and older undergoing surgery for removal of a solid malignant tumour were included in an observational cohort study. All complications occurring up to 30 days postoperatively were documented prospectively. Inflammatory markers were measured in plasma samples pre- and postoperatively: C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Associations between inflammatory markers and postoperative complications were explored using logistic regression analysis. Between July 2010 and April 2014, plasma samples of 224 patients were collected. Median age was 72 (65-89) years and 116 (51.8%) patients were female. Approximately half of the patients developed postoperative complications (49.6%) of whom 62 patients (55.9%) developed >1 complication. An independent prognostic effect was observed for the inflammatory biomarkers IL-6 and IL-10 for the occurrence of postoperative complications. The perioperative inflammatory response is associated with complications, independently from patient and surgical factors which are also associated with outcome. Research is warranted towards further exploration of the perioperative inflammatory response with the aim to improve perioperative care and outcome, and might help to improve surgical planning and decision making for older patients with cancer.},

  abstract = {For high-risk spinal surgeries, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is used to detect and prevent intraoperative neurological injury. The motor tracts are monitored by recording and analyzing muscle transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potentials (mTc-MEPs). A mTc-MEP amplitude decrease of 50-80% is the most common warning criterion for possible neurological injury. However, these warning criteria often result in false positive warnings. False positives may be caused by inadequate depth of anesthesia and blood pressure on mTc-MEP amplitudes. The aim of this paper is to validate the study protocol in which the goal is to investigate the effects of depth of anesthesia (part 1) and blood pressure (part 2) on mTc-MEPs. Per part, 25 patients will be included. In order to investigate the effects of depth of anesthesia, a processed electroencephalogram (pEEG) monitor will be used. At pEEG values of 30, 40 and 50, mTc-MEP measurements will be performed. To examine the effect of blood pressure on mTc-MEPs the mean arterial pressure will be elevated from 60 to 100 mmHg during which mTc-MEP measurements will be performed. We hypothesize that by understanding the effects of depth of anesthesia and blood pressure on mTc-MEPs, the mTc-MEP monitoring can be interpreted more reliably. This may contribute to fewer false positive warnings. By performing this study after induction and prior to incision, this protocol provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of depths of anesthesia and blood pressure on mTc-MEPs alone with as little confounders as possible.

  abstract = {In laboratory animals, exposure to most general anaesthetics leads to neurotoxicity manifested by neuronal cell death and abnormal behaviour and cognition. Some large human cohort studies have shown an association between general anaesthesia at a young age and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficits, but these studies are prone to bias. Others have found no evidence for an association. We aimed to establish whether general anaesthesia in early infancy affects neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this international, assessor-masked, equivalence, randomised, controlled trial conducted at 28 hospitals in Australia, Italy, the USA, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, we recruited infants of less than 60 weeks' postmenstrual age who were born at more than 26 weeks' gestation and were undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy, without previous exposure to general anaesthesia or risk factors for neurological injury. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a web-based randomisation service to receive either awake-regional anaesthetic or sevoflurane-based general anaesthetic. Anaesthetists were aware of group allocation, but individuals administering the neurodevelopmental assessments were not. Parents were informed of their infants group allocation upon request, but were told to mask this information from assessors. The primary outcome measure was full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, third edition (WPPSI-III), at 5 years of age. The primary analysis was done on a per-protocol basis, adjusted for gestational age at birth and country, with multiple imputation used to account for missing data. An intention-to-treat analysis was also done. A difference in means of 5 points was predefined as the clinical equivalence margin. This completed trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00756600. Between Feb 9, 2007, and Jan 31, 2013, 4023 infants were screened and 722 were randomly allocated: 363 (50%) to the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 359 (50%) to the general anaesthesia group. There were 74 protocol violations in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and two in the general anaesthesia group. Primary outcome data for the per-protocol analysis were obtained from 205 children in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 242 in the general anaesthesia group. The median duration of general anaesthesia was 54 min (IQR 41-70). The mean FSIQ score was 99·08 (SD 18·35) in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 98·97 (19·66) in the general anaesthesia group, with a difference in means (awake-regional anaesthesia minus general anaesthesia) of 0·23 (95% CI -2·59 to 3·06), providing strong evidence of equivalence. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were similar to those of the per-protocol analysis. Slightly less than 1 h of general anaesthesia in early infancy does not alter neurodevelopmental outcome at age 5 years compared with awake-regional anaesthesia in a predominantly male study population.

  abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an accepted treatment for patients with medication-resistant Tourette syndrome (TS). Sedation is commonly required during electrode implantation to attenuate anxiety, pain, and severe tics. Anesthetic agents potentially impair the quality of microelectrode recordings (MER). Little is known about the effect of these anesthetics on MER in patients with TS. We describe our experience with different sedative regimens on MER and tic severity in patients with TS. The clinical records of all TS patients who underwent DBS surgery between 2010 and 2018 were reviewed. Demographic data, stimulation targets, anesthetic agents, perioperative complications, and MER from each hemisphere were collected and analyzed. Single-unit activity was identified by filtering spiking activity from broadband MER data and principal component analysis with K-means clustering. Vocal and motor tics which caused artifacts in the MER data were manually selected using visual and auditory inspection. Six patients underwent bilateral DBS electrode implantation. In all patients, the target was the anterior internal globus pallidus. Patient comfort and hemodynamic and respiratory stability were maintained with conscious sedation with one or more of the following anesthetic drugs: propofol, midazolam, remifentanil, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Good quality MER and clinical testing were obtained in 9 hemispheres of 6 patients. In 3 patients, MER quality was poor on one side. Cautiously applied sedative drugs can provide patient comfort, hemodynamic and respiratory stability, and suppress severe tics, with minimal interference with MER.},

  abstract = {The aim was to investigate the feasibility and optimal stimulation parameters for supramaximal stimulation of muscle recorded transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potentials (mTc-MEP). Forty-seven consecutive patients that underwent scoliosis surgery were included. First, the feasibility of supramaximal stimulation was assessed for two settings (setting 1: pulse duration 0.075ms, interstimulus interval (ISI) 1.5ms; setting 2: pulse duration 0.300ms, ISI 3ms). Thereafter, three mTc-MEP parameters were considered for both settings; (1) elicitability, (2) amplitude, and (3) if supramaximal stimulation was achieved with ≥ 20 V below maximum output. Finally, ISIs (1ms-4ms) were optimized for setting 1. Nine patients (19.15%) were excluded. Of the remaining patients, supramaximal stimulation was achieved in all patients for setting 1, and in 26 (68.42%) for setting 2. In one patient, mTc-MEPs were elicitable in more muscles for setting (1) Amplitudes were not significantly different. Stimulation voltage could be increased ≥ 20 V in all 38 patients for setting 1 and in 10 (38.46%) for setting (2) Optimal ISI's differed widely. We recommend using setting 1 when monitoring mTc-MEPs with supramaximal stimulation, after which an individualized ISI optimization can be performed. Moreover, when using supramaximal stimulation, short ISI's (i.e. 1ms or 1.5ms) can be the optimal ISI for obtaining the highest mTc-MEP amplitude.},

It causes an arousable state of sedation, which is beneficial during neurosurgical procedures that require the patient to cooperate with neurological tests (i.e. tumor surgery or implantation of deep brain stimulators). During procedures where monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials and/or motor evoked potentials is required, dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjunct to general anesthesia with GABAergic drugs to decrease the dose of the latter when these drugs impair the monitoring signals. The use of dexmedetomidine has also been associated with neuroprotective effects and a decreased incidence of delirium, but studies confirming these effects in the peri-operative (neuro-)surgical setting are lacking. Although dexmedetomidine does not cause respiratory depression, its hemodynamic effects are complex and careful patient selection, choice of dose, and monitoring must be performed.},

  abstract = {Physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle are associated with a chronic low-level inflammatory state which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. There is growing interest in exercise programs as part of surgical 'prehabilitation'. We therefore studied preoperative physical activity levels of patients undergoing elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery, and performed an exploratory analysis of the influence of physical activity on postoperative outcome. The Short Questionnaire to Assess Health (SQUASH) was used to assess physical activity among 100 patients, of mean (SD) age 65.4 (7.6) years. Additionally, handgrip strength was measured, and the get-up-and-go test was conducted. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed, and a computerised cognitive test battery was used to assess cognitive performance preoperatively, and three months after surgery. Preoperatively, 76% of patients met the recommended national guidelines for physical activity. The incidence of pre-existing medical conditions, and other pre-operative patient features were similar in active and inactive patients. Preoperative physical activity was significantly inversely related to the logistic EuroSCORE. The level of physical activity was also significantly inversely related with preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) and peak postoperative CRP, but physical activity did not appear to be associated with any adverse postoperative outcomes or extended length of hospital stay. The incidence of postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PNCD) at 3 months postoperatively was 26%. Cognitive performance was not related with physical activity levels. In summary, this was the first study to assess activity levels of cardiac surgical patients with the SQUASH questionnaire. The majority of patients were physically active. Although physical activity was associated with lower levels of inflammation in this pilot study, it was not associated with an improved clinical or cognitive postoperative outcome.},

The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between the intraoperative MLE and the clinical effect of DBS. Thirty Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III (MDS-UPDRS III) scores during bilateral STN-DBS implantation were included in this retrospective study. MDS-UPDRS III subscores (resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia) of the contralateral upper extremity were used. During surgery, these subscores were assessed directly before and after insertion of the electrode. Also, these subscores were determined in the outpatient clinic after 11 weeks on average (on-stimulation). All assessments were performed in an off-medication state (at least 12 hours of medication washout). Postinsertion MDS-UPDRS motor scores decreased significantly compared to preinsertion scores (p < 0.001 for both hemispheres). The MLE showed a positive correlation with the clinical effect of DBS in both hemispheres (rho = 0.68 for the primarily treated hemisphere, p < 0.001, and rho = 0.59 for the secondarily treated hemisphere, p < 0.01). The MLE has a clinically relevant correlation with the effect of DBS in PD patients. These results suggest that the MLE can be relied upon as evidence of a clinically effective DBS electrode placement.},

The aim of this study is to describe the prehospital epidemiology, characteristics and outcome of (suspected) severe TBI in the Netherlands. The BRAIN-PROTECT study is a prospective observational study on prehospital management of patients with severe TBI in the Netherlands. The study population comprised all consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of TBI and a prehospital GCS score ≤ 8, who were managed by one of the 4 Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS). Patients were followed-up in 9 trauma centers until 1 year after injury. Planned sub-analyses were performed for patients with "confirmed" and "isolated" TBI. Data from 2,589 patients, of whom 2,117 (81.8%) were transferred to a participating trauma center, were analyzed. The incidence rate of prehospitally suspected and confirmed severe TBI were 3.2 (95% CI: 3.1;3.4) and 2.7 (95% CI: 2.5;2.8) per 100,000 inhabitants per year, respectively. Median patient age was 46 years, 58.4% were involved in traffic crashes, of which 37.4% were bicycle related. 47.6% presented with an initial GCS of 3. The median time from HEMS dispatch to hospital arrival was 54 minutes. The overall 30-day mortality was 39.0% (95% CI: 36.8;41.2). This article summarizes the prehospital epidemiology, characteristics and outcome of severe TBI in the Netherlands, and highlights areas in which primary prevention and prehospital care can be improved.},

The effect of these agents on MER are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of commonly used PSA agents, dexmedetomidine, clonidine and remifentanil and patient characteristics on MER during DBS surgery. Data from 78 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent STN-DBS surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The procedures were performed under local anesthesia or under PSA with dexmedetomidine, clonidine or remifentanil. In total, 4082 sites with multi-unit activity (MUA) and 588 with single units were acquired. Single unit firing rates and coefficient of variation (CV), and MUA total power were compared between patient groups. We observed a significant reduction in MUA, an increase of the CV and a trend for reduced firing rate by dexmedetomidine. The effect of dexmedetomidine was dose-dependent for all measures. Remifentanil had no effect on the firing rate but was associated with a significant increase in CV and a decrease in MUA. Clonidine showed no significant effect on firing rate, CV or MUA. In addition to anesthetic effects, MUA and CV were also influenced by patient-dependent variables. Our results showed that PSA influenced neuronal properties in the STN and the dexmedetomidine (DEX) effect was dose-dependent. In addition, patient-dependent characteristics also influenced MER.},

  abstract = {Intraoperative and postoperative hypotension occur commonly and are associated with organ injury and poor outcomes. Changes in arterial blood pressure (BP) during procedural sedation are not well described. Individual patient data from five trials of propofol sedation for colonoscopy and a clinical database were pooled and explored with logistic and linear regression. A literature search and focused meta-analysis compared the incidence of hypotension with propofol and alternative forms of procedural sedation. Hypotensive episodes were characterised by the original authors' definitions (typically systolic BP <90 mm Hg). In pooled individual patient data (n=939), 36% of procedures were associated with episodes of hypotension. Longer periods of propofol sedation and larger propofol doses were associated with longer-lasting and more-profound hypotension. Amongst 380 patients for whom individual BP measurements were available, 107 (28%) experienced systolic BP <90 mm Hg for >5 min, and in 89 (23%) the episodes exceeded 10 min. Meta-analysis of 18 RCTs identified an increased risk ratio for the development of hypotension in procedures where propofol was used compared with the use of etomidate (two studies; n=260; risk ratio [RR] 2.0 [95% confidence interval: 1.37-2.92]; P=0.0003), remimazolam (one study; n=384; RR 2.15 [1.61-2.87]; P=0.0001), midazolam (14 studies; n=2218; RR 1.46 [1.18-1.79]; P=0.0004), or all benzodiazepines (15 studies; n=2602; 1.67 [1.41-1.98]; P<0.00001). Hypotension was less likely with propofol than with dexmedetomidine (one study; n=60; RR 0.24 [0.09-0.62]; P=0.003). Hypotension is common during propofol sedation for colonoscopy and of a magnitude and duration associated with harm in surgical patients.},

  abstract = {Physical activity prior to elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery can potentially improve postoperative outcomes. The aim of the study was to evaluate subjectively and objectively physical activity levels and dose-characteristics in free-living conditions in patients awaiting CABG surgery. A single-centered cross-sectional subanalysis of 32 participants awaiting elective CABG surgery. Physical activity during the preoperative period was assessed subjectively with the SQUASH questionnaire and objectively with the Sensewear activity monitor (accelerometer with physiological sensors). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess differences and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreement between the measurement methods. Descriptive statistics were used for the dose-characteristics and Cohen's Kappa for the proportion of participants fulfilling the Dutch guideline for healthy physical activity (NNGB). Duration of vigorous activity was significantly higher when measured subjectively (120 min/week) than objectively (7 min/week, p = 0.001). Bland-Altman plots showed that differences between the methods increased with longer durations of moderate and total activity. The dose-characteristics of physical activity measured with the SQUASH varied widely among the participants and it consisted mainly of leisure time activities and light household activities. The percentage of participants complying with the NNGB guideline was 74% when measured subjectively and 90% when measured objectively (κ = 0.259, p = 0.089). Surprisingly, both measurement methods suggest that the majority of patients awaiting CABG surgery met the recommendations of the NNGB guideline. The agreement between the methods however decreased with higher physical activity levels. Despite its limitations, the study suggests the complementary value of a subjective and objective measurement of physical activity in free-living conditions among CABG patients.},

  abstract = {Transcranial electrical stimulation muscle-recorded motor evoked potentials (Tc-mMEPs) are used to monitor the spinal cord motor tracts during spinal surgery. There is considerable intra- and interindividual variability in the signals recorded, causing a high incidence of false positive warnings. Inadequate blood pressure is commonly blamed for false positive warnings and is usually managed with fluid and vasopressor therapy. The aim of the study was to systematically investigate the effects of norepinephrine and ephedrine-induced arterial blood pressure elevation on Tc-mMEPs. Twenty-five patients undergoing spinal surgery were included in this prospective observational study. After anesthetic induction and positioning, but before incision, a norepinephrine infusion was used to increase the mean arterial pressure (MAP) from approximately 60 to 100 mm Hg. Tc-mMEP amplitudes and area under the curves (AUC) were recorded from the abductor hallucis (AH), tibialis anterior (TA), and hand muscles every 2 minutes. Voltage thresholds of the AH, TA, and hand muscles were determined at MAP values of 60, 80, and 100 mm Hg. The primary objective was to determine the effects of increasing the MAP with a vasopressor infusion on Tc-mMEP amplitude, AUC, and threshold. For the secondary objective, the outcomes were adjusted for depth of anesthesia and propofol concentrations. Post hoc analyses included adjusting for confounders, noradrenaline infusion rate, and use of ephedrine, investigating the effects of cardiac index on Tc-mMEP characteristics, investigating the influence of increasing MAP on the excitability of the peripheral nervous system, and investigating the effects of MAP on BIS. In the AH, TA, and hand muscles, Tc-mMEP amplitudes and AUC were significantly associated with MAP (P < .02). A 10 mm Hg increase of the MAP was associated with a 11.0% to 17.7% increase in the amplitude and a 10.5% to 16.8% increase in the AUC. When adjusting for BIS, propofol concentrations, and use of ephedrine, MAP remained only significantly associated with the Tc-mMEP amplitude (P = .002) and AUC (P = .003) of the AH muscles. The influence of cardiac index on Tc-mMEP amplitude and AUC provided similar results when compared to the influence of MAP on Tc-mMEP amplitude and AUC. No influence of increasing MAP on the excitability of the peripheral nervous system was found. Increasing MAP significantly increased BIS values, even when corrected for propofol concentrations. Elevation of MAP is associated with significantly higher Tc-mMEP amplitudes, AUCs, and lower voltage threshold. When corrected for BIS, propofol concentration, and use of ephedrine, the associations between increasing MAP and Tc-mMEP characteristics were largely attenuated. BIS values significantly increased by increasing MAP, when corrected for propofol concentration. Thereby, our results imply that increasing MAP increases the cortical excitability.},

Postoperative cognitive impairments have generally been divided into short- (postoperative delirium) and long-term disturbances (postoperative cognitive dysfunction [POCD]). Long-term impairments are often subtle and overlooked. They need to be objectively assessed using neuropsychological tests to be diagnosed. Although POCD has been the subject of considerable research over the past decades, it remains uncertain why some patients do not return to preoperative levels of cognitive function. Surgery and anesthesia have both been implicated to play a role in POCD development, and certain patient-related factors, such as advanced age and low preoperative baseline cognitive function, have consistently been found to predict postoperative cognitive decline. This article will present an overview of POCD and its etiology and provide advice on possible strategies on its prevention.},

A 2-day in-person meeting was held in Washington, DC, on March 28-29, 2019, followed by a three-round, online modified Delphi consensus process. Thirty-six participants from academia, industry, and the Food and Drug Administration with expertise in relevant content areas, including two former ICU patients attended the in-person meeting, and the majority completed an online follow-up survey and participated in the modified Delphi process. The final recommendations were iteratively refined based on the survey results, participants' reactions to those results, summaries written by panel moderators, and a review of the meeting transcripts made from audio recordings. Fifteen recommendations were developed for study design and conduct, subject enrollment, outcomes, and measurement instruments. Consensus recommendations included obtaining input from ICU survivors and/or their families, ensuring adequate training for personnel using validated instruments for assessments of sedation, pain, and delirium in the ICU environment, and the need for methodological standardization. These recommendations are intended to assist researchers in the design, conduct, selection of endpoints, and reporting of clinical trials involving sedative medications and/or sedation protocols for adult ICU patients who require mechanical ventilation. These recommendations should be viewed as a starting point to improve clinical trials and help reduce methodological heterogeneity in future clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Potential biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamines and their corresponding precursors and metabolites. During CSF sampling, CSF flows towards the lumbar sampling site from more cranial regions. To compare the results of studies in which different CSF volumes were acquired, it is important to know if ventricular-lumbar concentration gradients exist. This has only been addressed for a few biogenic amines, and almost exclusively in neurologically unwell patients due to the burden of a lumbar puncture (necessary to obtain CSF). The aim of our study was to determine if concentration gradients exist for routinely measured CSF constituents and biogenic amines in neurologically healthy patients. We applied a novel ultrasensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of multiple monoamines, precursors and metabolites in CSF and plasma. CSF and blood samples were collected from twenty neurologically healthy patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia. Ten mL of lumbar CSF was collected in five consecutive two mL fractions. We determined leucocyte and erythrocyte counts, glucose, albumin and protein concentrations and quantified monoamines, precursors and metabolites on each of the fractions using LC-MS/MS. In twenty patients (60% male; median age: 46 years), dopamine, DOPAC, 3-MT, HVA, noradrenaline, normetanephrine and 5-HIAA concentrations increased from the first to the last CSF fraction (all p < 0.001). CSF adrenaline concentrations were below the detection limit, whereas serotonin measurements were regarded as unreliable. Albumin and total protein levels decreased significantly across CSF fractions. A ventricular-lumbar CSF concentration gradient existed for most of the investigated analytes. This is a novel finding for dopamine, noradrenaline, 3-MT and normetanephrine. These results contribute to the understanding of the neurobiology and underline the importance of standardized procedures for CSF handling to allow comparisons between studies.},

Systemic inflammation resulting in neuroinflammation is considered important in the pathogenesis of POCD. The aim of this study was to explore the association between the early surgery-induced inflammatory response and POCD within 3 months after surgery in older cancer patients. Patients ≥65 years in need of surgery for a solid tumor were included in a prospective cohort study. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured perioperatively. Cognitive performance was assessed preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. POCD was defined as a decline in cognitive test scores of ≥25% on ≥2 of five tests within the different cognitive domains of memory, executive functioning, and information processing speed. Logistic regression analysis was performed. POCD was observed in 44 (17.7%) of 248 included patients. Age >75, preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≤26 and major surgery were independent significant predictors for POCD. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, no significant associations were shown between the early surgery-induced inflammatory response and either POCD or decline within the different cognitive domains. This study shows that one out of six older patients with cancer developed POCD within 3 months after surgery. The early surgery-induced inflammatory response was neither associated with POCD, nor with decline in the separate cognitive domains. Further research is necessary for better understanding of the complex etiology of POCD.},

This multicenter cohort study is an analysis of prospectively collected observational data from the Brain Injury: Prehospital Registry of Outcome, Treatments and Epidemiology of Cerebral Trauma (BRAIN-PROTECT) study in the Netherlands. Patients treated for suspected severe TBI by the Dutch Helicopter Emergency Medical Services between February 2012 and December 2017 were included.

The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality at 1 year, functional neurological recovery at discharge (measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale), and length of hospital stay. Data were also collected on demographic factors, preinjury medical condition, injury characteristics, operational characteristics, and prehospital vital parameters. A total of 1827 patients were analyzed, of whom 1283 (70%) were male individuals and the median (interquartile range) age was 45 (23-65) years. In the unadjusted analysis, higher 30-day mortality was observed in patients who received prehospital tranexamic acid (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.55; P < .001), compared with patients who did not receive prehospital tranexamic acid. After adjustment for confounders, no association between prehospital administration of tranexamic acid and mortality was found across the entire cohort of patients. However, a substantial increase in the odds of 30-day mortality persisted in patients with severe isolated TBI who received prehospital tranexamic acid (OR, 4.49; 95% CI, 1.57-12.87; P = .005) and after multiple imputations (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.22-3.45; P = .007). This study found that prehospital tranexamic acid administration was associated with increased mortality in patients with isolated severe TBI, suggesting the judicious use of the drug when no evidence for extracranial hemorrhage is present.},

Fifteen patients with DMD and scoliosis and 15 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) underwent scoliosis correction surgery with the use of IONM. IONM consisted of transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potential (Tc-MEP) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring. The highest Tc-MEP amplitudes were collected to test the feasibility. Preoperative compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-MEPs were recorded to test the cortical excitability. SSEPs were scored as elicitable or not elicitable. Tc-MEP amplitudes were significantly lower in the DMD group for both the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. However, the abductor hallucis muscle had similar amplitudes in both the DMD as the AIS group. TMS/CMAP and Tc-MEP/CMAP ratios were similar in the DMD and AIS group (P = 0.126 and P = 0.792 respectively). Tc-MEP and SSEP monitoring is feasible, particularly when Tc-MEPs are recorded from the abductor hallucis muscle in patients with DMD. Similar TMS/CMAP and Tc-MEP/CMAP ratios show that there were no differences observed in cortical excitability between the groups. IONM seems a feasible and valuable neurophysiological tool to signal possible surgically induced damage to the spinal cord during scoliosis correction surgery in patients with DMD.},

Intranasal midazolam may provide a non-invasive sedation method, but there is currently no information on its use in geriatric patients. In this observational study, we included geriatric patients with severe MND and CRB needing urgent dental treatment. Each patient received 5 mg midazolam intranasally. Agitation/sedation levels, heart rate, respiration rate and oxygen saturation were recorded at 5-minute intervals. Thirty two patients were included. Mean age was 84 (±7) years. Mean (SD) time to treatment start was 13 (±5) minutes, and mean time to maximum sedation 17 (±11) minutes. Sedation was sufficient to enable dental treatment to be completed in 31 (97%) patients. Anxiolysis/light sedation occurred in 16 (50%) patients, and moderate to deep sedation occurred in 16 (50%) patients. No patients suffered from apnoea, although 3 patients required a chin-lift manoeuvre. Hypoxaemia occurred in 1 of these patients and in 2 other patients without airway obstruction. All patients recovered uneventfully. In a regression model, age, weight and other sedative medication use were found not to be associated with maximum sedation depth. Of 5 mg intranasal midazolam facilitates treatment of geriatric patients with MND in the comfort of their own environment. More information is needed to guide titration to balance the desired sedation level and patient safety.},

  abstract = {Severe traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young people around the world. Prehospital care focuses on the prevention and treatment of secondary brain injury and commonly includes tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia. The choice of induction agent in this setting is controversial. This study therefore investigated the association between the chosen induction medication etomidate versus S(+)-ketamine and the 30-day mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury who received prehospital airway management in the Netherlands. This study is a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected observational data of the Brain Injury: Prehospital Registry of Outcomes, Treatments and Epidemiology of Cerebral Trauma (BRAIN-PROTECT) cohort study. Patients with suspected severe traumatic brain injury who were transported to a participating trauma center and who received etomidate or S(+)-ketamine for prehospital induction of anesthesia for advanced airway management were included. Statistical analyses were performed with multivariable logistic regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis. In total, 1,457 patients were eligible for analysis. No significant association between the administered induction medication and 30-day mortality was observed in unadjusted analyses (32.9% mortality for etomidate versus 33.8% mortality for S(+)-ketamine; P = 0.716; odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.32; P = 0.711), as well as after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.73; P = 0.765; and risk difference 0.017; 95% CI, -0.051 to 0.084; P = 0.686). Likewise, in planned subgroup analyses for patients with confirmed traumatic brain injury and patients with isolated traumatic brain injury, no significant differences were found. Consistent results were found after multiple imputations of missing data. The analysis found no evidence for an association between the use of etomidate or S(+)-ketamine as an anesthetic agent for intubation in patients with traumatic brain injury and mortality after 30 days in the prehospital setting, suggesting that the choice of induction agent may not influence the patient mortality rate in this population.},

In this article, we present a short history of the concept and give an overview of recent changes and a practical update on diagnosis and definitions of brain death/DNC. Unresolved issues will be discussed. There is variability in brain death/DNC determination worldwide. In recent years, successful attempts have been made to harmonize these criteria and, consequently, to improve public trust in the process and diagnosis. An international multidisciplinary collaboration has been created and it has published minimum criteria, provided guidance for professionals and encouragement to revise or develop guidelines on brain death/DNC worldwide. There are two sets of criteria for declaration of death. First, if there is neither cardiac output nor respiratory effort, then cardiopulmonary criteria are used. Second, if both the cerebrum and brainstem have completely and permanently lost all functions, and there is a persistent coma, absent brainstem reflexes and no spontaneous respiratory effort, death can be declared on the basis of brain death/DNC. Although attempts to formulate uniform criteria are ongoing, consensus has been reached on the minimum criteria. Some inconsistencies and questions remain.},

However, the applicability of standard sleep scoring guidelines by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) has been questioned, with most polysomnography (PSG) studies in critically ill patients reporting difficulties in setting up and processing and scoring the recordings. The present study explores human inter-rater agreement in sleep stage scoring following the AASM guidelines, within a heterogenous ICU patient cohort. Two human experts independently scored a total of 51,454 epochs in 20 PSG recordings acquired at the ICU. Epoch-per-epoch comparison of scored stages revealed a Cohen's κ coefficient of agreement of 0.36 for standard 5-stage scoring. Highest agreement occurred in Wake (κ = 0.46), while REM showed the lowest (κ = 0.12). Significant correlations were found between inter-rater agreement, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II, r = - 0.506, p = 0.038), and 12-month mortality (r = - 0.524, p = 0.031). Comparison with similar studies underscore challenges in applying AASM criteria to ICU patients. Despite accounting for artifacts, disparities persisted, emphasizing the need for a nuanced exploration of factors influencing scoring inconsistencies in critically ill patients.

  abstract = {Tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity are incapacitating motor symptoms that can be suppressed with stereotactic neurosurgical treatment like deep brain stimulation (DBS) and ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy, pallidotomy). Traditionally, clinicians rely on clinical rating scales for intraoperative evaluation of these motor symptoms during awake stereotactic neurosurgery. However, these clinical scales have a relatively high inter-rater variability and rely on experienced raters. Therefore, objective registration (e.g., using movement sensors) is a reasonable extension for intraoperative assessment of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. The main goal of this scoping review is to provide an overview of electronic motor measurements during awake stereotactic neurosurgery. The protocol was based on the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. After a systematic database search (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science), articles were screened for relevance. Hundred-and-three articles were subject to detailed screening. Key clinical and technical information was extracted. The inclusion criteria encompassed use of electronic motor measurements during stereotactic neurosurgery performed under local anesthesia. Twenty-three articles were included. These studies had various objectives, including correlating sensor-based outcome measures to clinical scores, identifying optimal DBS electrode positions, and translating clinical assessments to objective assessments. The studies were highly heterogeneous in device choice, sensor location, measurement protocol, design, outcome measures, and data analysis. This review shows that intraoperative quantification of motor symptoms is still limited by variable signal analysis techniques and lacking standardized measurement protocols. However, electronic motor measurements can complement visual evaluations and provide objective confirmation of correct placement of the DBS electrode and/or lesioning. On the long term, this might benefit patient outcomes and provide reliable outcome measures in scientific research.},

Ten chimpanzees were anaesthetized for regular veterinary examinations. Propofol was used as an induction or maintenance agent. Blood samples were collected from a catheter in a cephalic vein at 3-7 time points between 1 and 100 min following the propofol bolus and/or infusion in five chimpanzees, or TCI in six chimpanzees. Cp was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The Marsh, Schnider and Eleveld human pharmacokinetic models were used to predict Cp for each case and we examined the predictive performances of these models using the Varvel criteria Median PE and Median APE. Median PE and Median APE for Marsh, Schnider and Eleveld models were within or close to the acceptable range. A human TCI pump was successfully maintained propofol Cp during general anesthesia in six chimpanzees. Human propofol pharmacokinetic models and TCI pumps can be applied in chimpanzees.},

Clinical improvements rely on careful patient selection and accurate electrode placement. A common method for target localization is intraoperative microelectrode recording (MER). To facilitate MER, DBS surgery is traditionally performed under local or regional anesthesia. However, sedation or general anesthesia is sometimes needed for patients who are unable to tolerate the procedure fully awake because of severe motor symptoms, psychological distress, pain, or other forms of discomfort. The effect of anesthetic drugs on MER is controversial but likely depends on the type and dose of a particular anesthetic agent, underlying disease, and surgical target. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of the current literature on the anesthetic drugs most often used for sedation and anesthesia during DBS surgery, with a focus on their effects on MERs.},

Environmental factors are thought to play a central role in ICU sleep disruption, and so it is unclear why environmental interventions have shown limited improvements in objectively assessed sleep. In critically ill patients, it is difficult to isolate the influence of environmental factors from the varying contributions of non-environmental factors. We thus investigated the effects of the ICU environment on self-reported and objective sleep quality in 10 healthy nurses and doctors with no history of sleep pathology or current or past ICU employment participated. Their sleep at home, in an unfamiliar environment ('Control'), and in an active ICU ('ICU') was evaluated using polysomnography and the Richard-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Environmental sound, light and temperature exposure were measured continuously. We found that the control and ICU environment were noisier and warmer, but not darker than the home environment. Sleep on the ICU was perceived as qualitatively worse than in the home and control environment, despite relatively modest effects on polysomnography parameters compared with home sleep: mean total sleep times were reduced by 48 min, mean rapid eye movement sleep latency increased by 45 min, and the arousal index increased by 9. Arousability to an awake state by sound was similar. Our results suggest that the ICU environment plays a significant but partial role in objectively assessed ICU sleep impairment in patients, which may explain the limited improvement of objectively assessed sleep after environmental interventions.},

General-purpose models have been developed for propofol, remifentanil, and dexmedetomidine, suitable for use in a wide variety of patients, but still not universally applicable. A validation study of the predictive performance of the Eleveld propofol model showed reasonable performance in children, healthy adults, and obese adults but poorer performance in elderly patients. Observational studies show that complications during total intravenous anesthesia often arise from omission of basic safety checks and inadequate knowledge, rather than model misspecification. Specifically, there is a lack of understanding of the influence of the clinical situation on the pharmacodynamics of hypnotic drugs. Artificial intelligence is likely to produce useful drug infusion rate advisory systems, or even closed-loop control systems that could potentially provide better patient-individualized titration of anesthetic drugs. Further efforts to develop new models are unlikely to be clinically beneficial. Efforts should rather be made to ensure better education and a better appreciation of variability in pharmacodynamics and the need for better ways of tailoring drug doses to individual patient needs.},

This study investigates the occurrence of intestinal integrity loss during oncologic surgery, measured by I-FABP change. Secondary the relationship between compromised intestinal integrity, and related variables and complications were studied. Patients undergoing oncologic surgery from prospective cohort studies were included. Urine I-FABP samples were collected preoperatively (T0) and at wound closure (T1), and in a subgroup on Day 1 (D1) and Day 2 (D2) postoperatively. I-FABP dynamics were investigated and logistic regression analyses were performed to study the association between I-FABP levels and patient-related, surgical variables and complications. A total of 297 patients were included with median age of 70 years. Median I-FABP value increased from 80.0 pg/mL at T0 (interquartile range [IQR] 38.0-142.0) to 115 pg/mL at T1 (IQR 48.0-198.0) (p < 0.05). Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.08) and anesthesia time (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25) were related to stronger I-FABP increase. When comparing I-FABP change in patients experiencing any complications versus no complications, relative I-FABP change at T1 was 145% of T0 (IQR 86-260) versus 113% (IQR 44-184) respectively (p < 0.05). A significant change in I-FABP levels was seen perioperatively indicating compromised intestinal integrity. Age and anesthesia time were related to higher I-FABP increase. In patients experiencing postoperative complications, a higher I-FABP increase was found.},

Biomarker research using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a promising way to illuminate the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. CSF biomarker studies performed so far generally included patients with neurodegenerative diseases without an adequate control group. The Anaesthetic Biobank of Cerebrospinal fluid (ABC) was established to address this. The aims are to (I) provide healthy-control reference values for CSF-based biomarkers, and (II) to investigate associations between CSF-based candidate biomarkers and neuropsychiatric symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, we collect and store CSF and blood from adult patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for elective surgery. Blood (20.5 mL) is collected during intravenous cannulation and CSF (10 mL) is aspirated prior to intrathecal local anaesthetic injection. A portion of the blood and CSF is sent for routine laboratory analyses, the remaining material is stored at -80 °C. Relevant clinical, surgical and anaesthetic data are registered. A neurological examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are performed pre-operatively and a subset of patients fill in questionnaires on somatic and mental health (depression, anxiety and stress). Four-hundred-fifty patients (58% male; median age: 56 years) have been enrolled in the ABC. The planned spinal anaesthetic procedure was not attempted for various reasons in eleven patients, in fourteen patients the spinal puncture failed and in twelve patients CSF aspiration was unsuccessful. A mean of 9.3 mL CSF was obtained in the remaining 413 of patients. Most patients had a minor medical history and 60% scored in the normal range on the MoCA (median score: 26). The ABC is an ongoing biobanking project that can contribute to CSF-based biomarker research. The large sample size with constant sampling methods and extensive patient phenotyping provide excellent conditions for future neuroscientific research.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between a range of pre- and peroperative factors and the extent of the inflammatory response, and to identify patients at risk of a greater inflammatory response following surgery. Patients 65 years and older undergoing a surgical procedure for a solid malignant tumour were prospectively included in an observational cohort study. Inflammatory markers were measured in plasma samples pre- and postoperatively: C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Preoperative and postoperative inflammatory factor assay results were compared, and associations between inflammatory markers and pre- and peroperative factors were explored using multivariate linear regression analysis. Between July 2010 and April 2014, plasma samples of 224 patients were obtained. Median age was 72 (65-89) years and 108 (48.2%) patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was carcinoma, 156 (69.6%). Anaesthesia duration was associated with increase in CRP, IL-1β and IL-6; intracavitary surgery with increase in IL-6; blood loss with decrease in CRP and IL-1β; total fluid volume administered with a decrease in IL-1β and disease stage was associated with increase in IL-6. The perioperative inflammatory response is related more to surgical characteristics rather than to preoperative factors (with the exception of disease stage). Elderly oncological patients undergoing longer lasting, intracavitary surgical procedures for more advanced disease stages develop the most intense inflammatory response.},

  abstract = {Target-controlled infusion systems are increasingly used to administer intravenous anaesthetic drugs to achieve a user-specified plasma or effect-site target concentration. While several studies have investigated the ability of the underlying pharmacokinetic-dynamic models to predict plasma concentrations, there are no data on their performance in predicting drug concentrations in the human brain. We assessed the predictive performance of the Marsh propofol model and Minto remifentanil model for plasma and brain tissue concentrations. Plasma samples were obtained during neurosurgery from 38 patients, and brain tissue samples from nine patients. Propofol and remifentanil concentrations were measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analysed from the nine patients in whom both plasma and brain samples were simultaneously obtained. For the Minto model (five patients), the median performance error was 72% for plasma and -14% for brain tissue concentration predictions. The model tended to underestimate plasma remifentanil concentrations, and to overestimate brain tissue remifentanil concentrations. For the Marsh model (five patients), the median prediction errors for plasma and brain tissue concentrations were 12% and 81%, respectively. However, when the data from all blood propofol assays (36 patients) were analysed, the median prediction error was 11%, with overprediction in 15 (42%) patients and underprediction in 21 (58%). These findings confirm earlier reports demonstrating inaccuracy for commonly used pharmacokinetic-dynamic models for plasma concentrations and extend these findings to the prediction of effect-site concentrations.},

  abstract = {Biomarkers for neurodegenerative dementias offer interesting prospects regarding diagnosis and disease monitoring. Monoamines such as dopamine, (nor)adrenaline, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), and their respective metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were shown to be altered in dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biomarker research is hampered by potential confounds including the influence of time of day and volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected. Therefore, the possibility of a circadian rhythm in CSF and plasma, and the presence of a rostrocaudal concentration gradient (RCG) in CSF for aforementioned monoamines/metabolites, were investigated. Circadian rhythmicity was assessed using reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (RP-UHPLC-ECD) to measure monoamine/metabolite concentrations in 271 paired CSF and plasma samples, successively collected over a period of 30 h and derived from eight healthy subjects. Plasma samples were also analyzed for melatonin, serving as positive control analyte, using ELISA. The RCG examination entailed RP-UHPLC-ECD analyses on five consecutive CSF samples derived from 10 patients with AD and 10 non-AD/control subjects. Besides a diurnal rhythm for melatonin, we found a similar rhythmicity for plasma HVA, with acrophases occurring between 02:00 and 06:00 h, in four out of seven subjects. Three and two subjects showed a circadian rhythm for CSF HVA and 5-HIAA, respectively. No rhythmicity was observed in any other compound. We found that only CSF MHPG, HVA and 5-HIAA levels differed across CSF fractions, and that these changes in 5-HIAA levels varied in the AD versus non-AD/control group. Positive correlations between CSF volume and HVA and 5-HIAA levels, indicative of a RCG, were also observed. Such a RCG could not be detected for the other monoamines/metabolites. Our results stress the importance of standardizing sampling procedures of biological fluids with respect to time of day, volume and number of samples.},

  abstract = {Subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a routine treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). DBS surgery is commonly performed under local anesthesia (LA) to obtain reliable microelectrode recordings. However, procedural sedation and/or analgesia (PSA) is often desirable to improve patient comfort. The impact of PSA in addition to LA on outcome is largely unknown. Therefore, we performed an observational study to assess the effect of PSA compared to LA alone during STN DBS surgery on outcome in PD patients. Seventy PD patients (22 under LA, 48 under LA + PSA) scheduled for STN DBS implantation were included. Dexmedetomidine, clonidine or remifentanil were used for PSA. The primary outcome was the change in Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score III (MDS-UPDRS III) and levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) between baseline, one month before surgery, and twelve months postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures were motor function during activities of daily living (MDS-UPDRS II), cognitive alterations and surgical adverse events. Postoperative assessment was conducted in "on" stimulation and "on" medication conditions. At twelve months follow-up, UPDRS III and UPDRS II scores in "on" medication conditions were similar between the LA and PSA groups. The two groups showed a similar LEDD reduction and an equivalent decline in executive function measured by the Stroop Color-Word Test, Trail Making Test-B, and verbal fluency. The incidence of perioperative and postoperative adverse events was similar between groups. This study demonstrates that PSA during STN DBS implantation surgery in PD patients was not associated with differences in motor and non-motor outcome after twelve months compared with LA only.},

However, the quality of task completion, that is the final image quality, was subjectively evaluated in these studies. Ideally, the endpoint metric should be an objective comparison of the trainee-acquired image with a reference ideal image. Therefore, we developed a simulator-based methodology of preclinical verification of proficiency (VOP) in trainees by tracking objective evaluation of the final acquired images. We utilized geometric data from the simulator probes to compare image acquisition of anesthesia residents who participated in our structured longitudinal simulator-based TEE educational program vs ideal image planes determined from a panel of experts. Thirty-three participants completed the study (15 experts, 7 postgraduate year (PGY)-1 and 11 PGY-4). The results of our study demonstrated a significant difference in image capture success rates between learners and experts (χ2 = 14.716, df = 2, P < 0.001) with the difference between learners (PGY-1 and PGY-4) not being statistically significant (χ2 = 0, df = 1, P = 1.000). Therefore, our results suggest that novices (i.e. PGY-1 residents) are capable of attaining a level of proficiency comparable to those with modest training (i.e. PGY-4 residents) after completion of a simulation-based training curriculum. However, professionals with years of clinical training (i.e. attending physicians) exhibit a superior mastery of such skills. It is hence feasible to develop a simulator-based VOP program in performance of TEE for junior anesthesia residents.},

Whereas it implies chronicity, it lacks specificity in discriminating normal from a significantly remodeled MV apparatus. Regional aspects of MV remodeling have shown superior value over global remodeling in predicting recurrence after MV repair for IMR. Quite possibly, presence of specific regional changes in MV geometry that are unique to chronic IMR patients could also be used to diagnose the presence and track progression of remodeling. Knowledge of these changes in MV apparatus in patients with IMR can possibly be used to identify patients for surgical intervention before irreversible remodeling occurs. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiographic data were collected from patients who underwent MV surgery for IMR (IMR group, n = 66), and from patients with normal valvular and biventricular function (control group, n = 10). The acquired data of the MV were geometrically analyzed to make regional comparisons between the IMR and the control group to identify measurements that reliably differentiate normal from remodeled MVs. Lengthening of the middle potion of the anterior annulus (A2 regional perimeter: 11.149 mm versus 9.798 mm, p = 0.0041), larger nonplanarity angle (147.985 versus 140.720 degrees, p = 0.0459), and increased tenting angle of the posteromedial scallop of the posterior leaflet (P3 tenting angle: 44.354 versus 40.461 degrees, p = 0.0435) were sufficient in differentiating between IMR and the control group. Specific three-dimensional changes in MV geometry can be used to reliably identify a significantly remodeled valve apparatus.},

Tertiary university hospital. This study sought expert consensus among a focus group of 9 members of an anesthesia department with experience in perioperative US. Afterward, 257 anesthesia faculty members from 133 academic centers across the United States were surveyed. A preliminary list of tasks was designed to establish the expectations of workflow understanding by an anesthesiology resident prior to clinical exposure to perioperative US. This list was modified by a focus group through an iterative process. Afterwards, a survey was sent to faculty members nationwide, and Likert scale ratings for each task were obtained and reviewed during a second round. Consensus among members of the focus group was reached after 2 iterations. 72 participants responded to the nationwide survey (28%), and consensus was reached after the second round (Cronbach's α = 0.99, ICC = 0.99) on a final list of 46 workflow-related tasks.

In this study, we used real-time 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to analyze geometric changes in multiple axes of the TA throughout the cardiac cycle in patients without right ventricular abnormalities. R-wave-gated 3D TEE images of the TA were acquired in 39 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The patients with abnormal right ventricular/tricuspid structure or function were excluded from the study. For each patient, eight points along the TA were traced in the 3D dataset and used to reconstruct the TA at four stages of the cardiac cycle (end- and mid-systole, end- and mid-diastole). Statistical analyses were applied to determine whether TA area, perimeter, axes, and planarity changed significantly over each stage of the cardiac cycle. TA area (P = 0.012) and perimeter (P = 0.024) both changed significantly over the cardiac cycle. Of all the axes, only the posterolateral-anteroseptal demonstrated significant dynamism (P < 0.001). There was also a significant displacement in the vertical axis between the points and the regression plane in end-systole (P < 0.001), mid-diastole (P = 0.014), and mid-systole (P < 0.001). The TA demonstrates selective dynamism over the cardiac cycle, and its axis of maximal dynamism is different from the axis (S-L) that is routinely measured with 2D TEE.},

A high-quality diastolic frame of the mitral valve was segmented using Mimics Innovation Suite and merged with a flange. The data were exported as a stereolithography (.stl) file, and a rigid 3-dimensional model was printed using a MakerBot Replicator 2 printer. A flexible silicone cast then was created and deployed in the pulse-duplicator chamber filled with a blood-mimicking fluid. The authors were able to obtain continuous-wave Doppler tracings of the valve inflow with a transesophageal echocardiography transducer. They also were able to generate diastolic ventricular and atrial pressure tracings. Pressure half-time and mitral valve area were computed from these measurements.

We examined the relation between administered insulin and renal potassium excretion in critically ill patients under computer-assisted glucose and potassium regulation. Prospective observational study. Twelve-bed surgical intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital. Consecutive intensive care unit patients. Potassium and glucose levels were regulated by a computer-assisted decision support system. Both potassium and insulin were continuously administered by syringe pump. Renal potassium excretion was measured daily in the 24-hr urine collections. The 24-hr urinary samples of patients with kidney failure or on renal replacement therapy were excluded. Multivariate analysis with potassium excretion as the dependent variable was performed. In 178 consecutive patients, 1,456 24-hr urinary samples, were analyzed. Mean ± SD plasma potassium was 4.2 ± 0.3 mmol/L, with 79 ± 46 mmol/d of potassium administered and a mean insulin dose of 53 ± 38 U/day. Renal potassium excretion was 126 ± 51 mmol/day. After multivariate analysis correcting for relevant variables (including diuretics, pH, potassium levels and renal sodium excretion), insulin administration was independently and positively associated with renal potassium excretion. Other significant variables were potassium levels, potassium administration, renal sodium and chloride excretion, creatinine clearance, diuretic therapy, pH, known diabetes and intensive care unit admission day (R = .52; p <. 001). Insulin administration is associated with an increase in the renal potassium excretion in critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {To evaluate the effect of the revised practice guideline 'Management of patients with mild traumatic head/brain injury' (MHI) in the Netherlands using the number of CT scans of the cerebrum, number of hospital admissions, and the number of intracranial traumatic findings on CT scan. Retrospective before-and-after study. A structured chart review over the 3-month period considerable time after implementation of the MHI guideline (study period) was compared with the 3-month-period before its introduction (control period). Both children and adults were included. Primary outcome measures were the percentage of hospital admissions and percentage of cerebrum CT scans in patients with MHI. Secondary outcome measures were traumatic findings on CT scan, neurosurgical intervention and adherence to the guideline. During the study and control periods, respectively 1063 and 1026 patients with MHI attended the emergency department of the study centre. During the study period a CT scan was carried out in 34.2% of patients, significantly more than in the control period 18.8%; p < 0.01). The percentage of admissions also increased from 13.8% to 18.2% (p = 0.01). The differences between the two periods were mainly in adults and in children aged 6 and older. There was no significant change in traumatic intracranial findings or neurosurgical interventions. Adherence to the guideline in regard to hospitalization (81.7% guideline adherence) and CT brain imaging (88.3% guideline adherence) was reasonably high. After introduction of the current MHI guideline in the Netherlands, percentages of both hospitalization and CT of cerebrum have increased significantly. It was expected that the guideline would result in decreases of this percentages. This increase does not seem to be related to more or serious head/brain injury.},

To summarize peer-reviewed literature on the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), and to identify its use as an outcome measure. Searches were performed of several electronic databases from 1995 to May 2010. Studies included were published articles containing (1) primary research investigating the psychometric and clinimetrics of the PSFS or (2) the implementation of the PSFS as an outcome measure. We assessed the methodological quality of studies included in the first category. Two hundred forty-two articles published from 1994 to May 2010 were identified. Of these, 66 met the inclusion criteria for this review, with 13 reporting the measurement properties of the PSFS, 55 implementing the PSFS as an outcome measure, and 2 doing both of the above. The PSFS was reported to be valid, reliable, and responsive in populations with knee dysfunction, cervical radiculopathy, acute low back pain, mechanical low back pain, and neck dysfunction. The PSFS was found to be reliable and responsive in populations with chronic low back pain. The PSFS was also reported to be valid, reliable, or responsive in individuals with a limited number of acute, subacute, and chronic conditions. This review found that the PSFS is also being used as an outcome measure in many other conditions, despite a lack of published evidence supporting its validity in these conditions. Although the use of the PSFS as an outcome measure is increasing in physiotherapy practice, there are gaps in the research literature regarding its validity, reliability, and responsiveness in many health conditions.},

The method was applied in an experimental paradigm where a subject and an investigator communicated in an interactive verbal generation task during fMRI. By applying online active noise cancellation, the quality of the subject's speech was substantially improved. The present approach was found to be flexible, reliable, and easy to implement, providing a method for fMRI studies that investigate the neural correlates of interactive speech communication.

The "ICU Support" team meeting concept aims to support intensive care unit (ICU) teams by promoting interprofessional communication, peer support, and patient safety by providing a structure for daily team meetings. This protocol describes a study to explore the effectiveness of "ICU Support" for patient- and staff-centered outcomes. ICU Support will be implemented at nine university hospitals located in Germany, following a two-arm randomized parallel group design with an intervention and a control condition and three data collection periods. In the intervention arm, leading ICU personnel (physicians and nurses) will be trained in ICU Support and implement the ICU Support elements into the daily work routine of their units upon completion of data collection period T0 (baseline). In the control arm, ICU Support will not be implemented until the completion of the data collection period T1 (1 month after study start). Until then, the regular daily schedule of the ICU teams will be maintained. The final data collection period (T2) will take place 4 months after the start of the study. Primary outcomes include the number of intensive care complications per patient during their ICU stay during T1 and the sick-related absence of ICU staff during T1. Secondary outcomes include, among others, the average severity of intensive care complications per patient and employee self-reported data regarding their teamwork and patient safety behaviors. The need for healthy and well-trained ICU staff is omnipresent; thus, structured and evidence-based interventions aimed at supporting ICU teams and facilitating patient safety are required. This multicenter study aims to explore the effectiveness of ICU Support for patient- and staff-centered outcomes. The insights derived from this study have the potential to significantly improve ICU patient safety, staff communication, and connectedness and decrease sickness-related expenses and social costs associated with high work demands among ICU staff.

The study was approved by the local ethics committee and registered at the German Clinical Trial Register on 27th of February 2024 (Registration number: DRKS00032661) prior to inclusion of the first participant. Within a two-armed group study design, paramedics and emergency physicians were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 44) or a control group (n = 44). The experimental group was initially exposed to a targeted brief training aimed at enhancing the recognition of excessively deep chest compression depth. All participants evaluated 42 distinct video sequences showing seven typical errors during CPR. The shown CPRs were simulated on a training manikin and the videos were evaluated by the participants under laboratory conditions. The primary endpoint was the accurate evaluation of the presented videos with too deep compression depth in a laboratory setting. A total of 3696 video sequences were evaluated. The experimental group demonstrated a significantly higher recognition rate for too deep chest compressions compared to the control group (87.9% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001). With regard to the remaining errors, no significant differences were observed between the study groups. Overall, 2861 of the 3696 videos (77.7%) were correctly classified. The proportion of correctly classified videos was significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group (79.8% vs. 75.6%, p = 0.003), indicating a statistically significant effect of the intervention. The identification of chest compressions with too deep compression depth in a video of simulated CPR was found to increase significantly in evaluators who had undergone a brief training course.

  abstract = {Recent resting-state functional connectivity studies have shown significant group differences in several networks between patients suffering from borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy controls. However, reliable and consistent findings have not been reported yet. Several methodological factors might be responsible for the discrepant findings, including the heterogeneity of patient samples in terms of symptom severity. In the current study, we combined investigations of the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of BPD patients with seed-based connectivity measures and then computed the correlation of connectivity measures with borderline symptom severity. Correlation-based connectivity analysis was performed on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 26 female BPD patients and 26 healthy controls. Increased intrinsic connectivity was found in clusters involving part of the caudate nucleus and the left insula in the patient group, indicating greater integration of each region. Further seed-based connectivity analyses revealed that with the caudate seed, the patient data exhibited an increased resting-state functional connectivity in the bilateral ventral striatum and the midline prefrontal regions extending to the ACC, a network associated with reward processing. The left insula seed showed significantly increased connectivity with the bilateral fronto-orbital/insula, the inferior parietal lobule and the mid-cingulate cortex, a network involved in attention and salience encoding, in the patient population. Moreover, symptom severity, as assessed with the BSL-95 outside the scanner, was negatively correlated with the coupling of the insula and the striatum in the BPD group. Overall, an increased functional connectivity within two large-scale circuitries underlying reward and salience processing was evident in patients, as compared to healthy participants. When correlated with borderline symptom severity, a reduced connectivity between key regions belonging to the reward system and salience network was observed in the patients. These findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the BPD pathophysiology and thereby delineate potential treatment targets.},

This study aimed to examine the role of error framing in basic life support (BLS) training for future healthcare professionals. In an equivalence trial ( The results regarding CD revealed equivalence with a trend toward superiority of EM over EA (proportional difference 23.3%-points; 95% CI 11.4%-34.2%) and EM over control (proportional difference 23.4%-points; 95% CI 11.5%-34.2%.) and significant equivalence of EA and control (proportional difference 0.1%-points; 95% CI -11.6%-11.7%). Significant equivalence was determined for all study arms with respect to CR and self-confidence. Our study revealed that EM was not detrimental to learners' CPR performance. Given existing research on long-term beneficial effects of EM on patient safety, coupled with the proven equivalence of EM and EA concerning short-term performance, we argue that EM is a promising approach for future medical education purposes. Raising awareness of error framing and teaching error-handling strategies is expected to benefit ongoing safety management efforts in medical education and beyond.},

This suggests an MAOA-L-specific neurobiological vulnerability associated with trait aggression. The neural networks underlying this vulnerability are unknown. The present study investigated genotype-specific associations between resting state brain networks and trait aggression (Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire) in 82 healthy Caucasian males. Genotype influences on aggression-related networks were studied for intrinsic and seed-based brain connectivity. Intrinsic connectivity was higher in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) of MAOA-L compared to high expressing allele (MAOA-H) carriers. Seed-based connectivity analyses revealed genotype differences in the functional involvement of this region. MAOA genotype modulated the relationship between trait aggression and VMPFC connectivity with supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and areas of the default mode network (DMN). Separate analyses for the two groups were performed to better understand how the genotype modulated the relationship between aggression and brain networks. They revealed a positive correlation between VMPFC connectivity and aggression in right angular gyrus (AG) and a negative correlation in right SMG in the MAOA-L group. No such effect emerged in the MAOA-H carriers. The results indicate a particular relevance of VMPFC for aggression in MAOA-L carriers; in specific, a detachment from the DMN along with a strengthened coupling to the AG seems to go along with lower trait aggression. MAOA-L carriers may thus depend on a synchronization of emotion regulation systems (VMPFC) with core areas of empathy (SMG) to prevent aggression.},

Experts on patient safety and medical education from 3 European countries were asked to suggest learning objectives concerning patient safety using group concept mapping. Following 3 successive steps, experts rated ideas by importance and difficulty to achieve. Correlation analyses investigated the relationship between those. Overarching topics of the learning goals (clusters) were identified with multivariate analysis. A total of 119 statements about intended learning objectives on patient safety were generated, of which 86 remained for sorting and rating. Based on multivariate analyses, 10 overarching topics (clusters) emerged. Both the learning objectives and the overarching topics showed high correspondence with the WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide. Strong correlations emerged between importance and difficulty ratings for learning objectives and overarching topics. The WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide's learning goals are still relevant and up-to-date. Remarkably, learning objectives categorized as highly important are also perceived as difficult to achieve. In summary, the insufficient implementation in medical curricula cannot be attributed to the content of the learning goals. The future focus should be on how the WHO learning goals can be implemented in existing curricular courses.},

The current study evaluated the state and needs of resilience in healthcare professionals in a representative European border region. All hospitals and emergency medical care services in the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands) were approached to participate via an online-survey. Behavioral data on psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), work-related stressors, individual resilience (Brief Resilience Scale, Resilience at Work scale), and organizational resilience (Benchmark Resilience Tool-short) were collected. 2233 participants initiated the survey with 500 responses included in the analysis. 46% of the participants indicated clinically significant psychological distress. Most challenging stressors were staff availability, available time, and workload. On average, individual resilience was in the normal range, yet 15.6% showed below average resilience. At the organizational level, healthcare institutions can particularly enhance resilience in the domains of Internal resources, Situation Awareness, and Unity of purpose. Compared to their neighbor countries, German healthcare professionals indicated higher levels of depressive symptoms, were more burdened by work-related stressors, and reported lower levels of organizational resilience. Findings highlight that healthcare institutions not only need to promote the resilience of the individual employee particularly in border regions, healthcare institutions, must also act to be better prepared for potential threats and crises while considering each country's unique needs.},

Altered transmission of the central nervous serotonin (5-HT) contributes to dysfunctions in the cognitive control of emotions. To date, studies relating to pharmaco-fMRI challenging of the 5-HT system have focused on emotion processing for facial expressions. We investigated effects of a single-dose selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) on emotion regulation during virtual violence. For this purpose, 38 male participants played a violent video game during fMRI scanning. The SSRI reduced neural responses to violent actions in right-hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex encompassing the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but not to non-violent actions. Within the ACC, the drug effect differentiated areas with high inhibitory 5-HT1A receptor density (subgenual s25) from those with a lower density (pregenual p32, p24). This finding links functional responses during virtual violent actions with 5-HT neurotransmission in emotion regulation networks, underpinning the ecological validity of the 5-HT model in aggressive behavior. Available 5-HT receptor density data suggest that this SSRI effect is only observable when inhibitory and excitatory 5-HT receptors are balanced. The observed early functional changes may impact patient groups receiving SSRI treatment.},

  abstract = {A gene-environment interaction between expression genotypes of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and adverse childhood experience increases the risk of antisocial behavior. However, the neural underpinnings of this interaction remain uninvestigated. A cortico-limbic circuit involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala is central to the suppression of aggressive impulses and is modulated by serotonin (5-HT). MAOA genotypes may modulate the vulnerability of this circuit and increase the risk for emotion regulation deficits after specific life events. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) challenges 5-HT regulation and may identify vulnerable neuronal circuits, contributing to the gene-environment interaction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging measured the resting-state state activity in 64 healthy males in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Cortical maps of amygdala correlation identified the impact of ATD and its interaction with low- (MAOA-L) and high-expression variants (MAOA-H) of MAOA on cortico-limbic connectivity. Across all Regions of Interest (ROIs) exhibiting an ATD effect on cortico-limbic connectivity, MAOA-L carriers were more susceptible to ATD than MAOA-H carriers. In particular, the MAOA-L group exhibited a larger reduction of amygdala connectivity with the right prefrontal cortex and a larger increase of amygdala connectivity with the insula and dorsal PCC. MAOA-L carriers were more susceptable to a central 5-HT challenge in cortico-limbic networks. Such vulnerability of the cortical serotonergic system may contribute to the emergence of antisocial behavior after systemic challenges, observed as gene-environment interaction.

  abstract = {Mismatch responses reflect neural mechanisms of early cognitive processing in the auditory domain. Disturbances of these mechanisms on multiple levels of neural processing may contribute to clinical symptoms in major depression (MD). A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted to identify neurobiological foundations of altered mismatch processing in MD. Twenty-five patients with major depression and 25 matched healthy individuals completed an auditory mismatch paradigm optimized for fMRI. Brain activity during mismatch processing was compared between groups. Moreover, seed-based connectivity analyses investigated depression-specific brain networks. In patients, mismatch processing was associated with reduced activation in the right auditory cortex as well as in a fronto-parietal attention network. Moreover, functional coupling between the right auditory cortex and frontal areas was reduced in patients. Seed-to voxel analysis on the whole-brain level revealed reduced connectivity between the auditory cortex and the thalamus as well as posterior cingulate. The present study indicates deficits in sensory processing on the level of the auditory cortex in depression. Hyposensitivity in a fronto-parietal network presumably reflects altered attention mechanisms in depression. The observed impairments may contribute to psychopathology by reducing the ability of the affected individuals to orient attention toward important environmental cues.},

  abstract = {Practical skills training is an essential part of medical education. An important example is the training of Basic Life Support (BLS) skills, which are key to improve patient outcomes in life-threatening situations. However, despite practical training, BLS performance is often sub-optimal even among healthcare professionals and medical students. Finding more effective training methods is therefore of high importance. A promising method to enhance learning outcomes is reflective practice. The goal of the present study was to evaluate whether a short reflective practice intervention following standard BLS training (Peyton's 4-step approach) improves BLS training outcomes, reflected in higher BLS performance and higher self-confidence to perform BLS. 287 first-year medical students were randomly assigned to one of two BLS training conditions: 1) standard BLS training (ST), 2) ST followed by a 15-minute reflective practice exercise. Outcome parameters included objective BLS performance data assessed by a resuscitation manikin, and students' self-reported confidence in their BLS skills. Outcomes were assessed directly after the training (T0) and re-assessed one week later (T1). A two-way mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effect of the intervention on BLS performance and self-reported confidence. Significance was determined by two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The intervention group performed significantly more effective compressions at T1 and began significantly faster with performing their first chest compression at T0 and T1, in comparison to the control group. No significant differences between study groups regarding their self-reported confidence to perform BLS were observed. This research shows that standard BLS training accompanied with a simple, cost-effective reflective practice exercise can improve learners' BLS skill acquisition and retention. This shows that reflective practice has the potential to enhance practical skills training in medicine; yet, more empirical studies are needed to examine its broader applicability.},

This contribution to boredom may shed light on its neural correlates, which are poorly characterized so far.

Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two independent coders performed the time-based analysis of the audio-visual game content. Boredom was operationalized as interaction of prolonged absence of goal-directed behavior with lowered affect in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). A decrease of positive affect (PA) correlated with response amplitudes in bilateral insular clusters extending into the amygdala to prolonged inactive phases in a game play and an increase in negative affect (NA) was associated with higher responses in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Precuneus and hippocampus responses were negatively correlated with changes in NA. We describe for the first time neural contributions to boredom, using a video game as complex virtual environment. Further our study confirmed that PA and NA are separable constructs, reflected by distinct neural patterns. PA may be associated with afferent limbic activity whereas NA with affective control.},

  abstract = {Aggressive behavior is associated with dysfunctions in an affective regulation network encompassing amygdala and prefrontal areas such as orbitofrontal (OFC), anterior cingulate (ACC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In particular, prefrontal regions have been postulated to control amygdala activity by inhibitory projections, and this process may be disrupted in aggressive individuals. The atypical antipsychotic quetiapine successfully attenuates aggressive behavior in various disorders; the underlying neural processes, however, are unknown. A strengthened functional coupling in the prefrontal-amygdala system may account for these anti-aggressive effects. An inhibition of this network has been reported for virtual aggression in violent video games as well. However, there have been so far no in-vivo observations of pharmacological influences on corticolimbic projections during human aggressive behavior. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, quetiapine and placebo were administered for three successive days prior to an fMRI experiment. In this experiment, functional brain connectivity was assessed during virtual aggressive behavior in a violent video game and an aggression-free control task in a non-violent modification. Quetiapine increased the functional connectivity of ACC and DLPFC with the amygdala during virtual aggression, whereas OFC-amygdala coupling was attenuated. These effects were observed neither for placebo nor for the non-violent control. These results demonstrate for the first time a pharmacological modification of aggression-related human brain networks in a naturalistic setting. The violence-specific modulation of prefrontal-amygdala networks appears to control aggressive behavior and provides a neurobiological model for the anti-aggressive effects of quetiapine.},

For educators, there are often pragmatic reasons to decide for one or another of them, such as costs, infrastructural requirements, time expenditure or qualification of the teacher. However, a central aspect to consider is the learning outcome: Does a new method achieve a similar learning success as an established standard method? To answer this question, we need an appropriate method to assess comparability of learning outcomes. In this paper, we present two essential statistical concepts that can address the issue of comparability of learning outcomes: Equivalence and non-inferiority testing. We explain the ideas behind these concepts and illustrate them with an example data set. To clarify several concepts, we use theoretical examples from one selected field: the teaching and assessment of Basic Life Support (BLS). Equivalence and non-inferiority tests can be powerful tools for comparing teaching and assessment methods. However, their correct application requires adequate knowledge about their strengths, pitfalls and application fields. The aim of this paper is to deliver this knowledge and to provide clinician researchers with a practical guidance to a successful application of these methods.},

  abstract = {Emotion regulation (ER) is crucial in terms of mental health and social functioning. Attention deployment (AD) and cognitive reappraisal (CR) are both efficient cognitive ER strategies, which are based on partially dissociated neural effects. Our understanding of the neural underpinnings of ER is based on laboratory paradigms that study changes of the brain activation related to isolated emotional stimuli. To track the neural response to ER in the changing and dynamic environment of daily life, we extended the common existing paradigms by applying a sequence of emotionally provocative stimuli involving three aversive images. Eighteen participants completed an ER paradigm, in which they had to either shift their attention away from the emotionally negative images by counting backwards (AD strategy) or reinterpret the meaning of stimuli (CR strategy) to attain a down-regulation of affective responses. An increased recruitment of left-sided lateral and medial PFC was shown upon regulation of negative emotions with CR as compared to AD. Remarkably, the amygdala activation showed an increasing pattern of activation during CR. The inverse relationship between PFC and amygdala was compromised during elongated blocks of reappraisal, reflecting a reduction in engagement of the top-down prefrontal regulatory circuitry upon repeated exposure to negative stimuli. These results highlight that temporal dynamic of amygdala response and its functional connectivity differentiates AD and CR strategies in regulating emotions. Findings of the current study underscore the importance of adopting temporally variant approaches for investigating the neural effects of ER. Identifying neural systems that subserve down-regulation of negative emotions is of importance in developing treatment strategies for various forms of psychopathology.},

Important top-down influences are attentional focus and supramodal social memory representations. The present study investigated the neural networks underlying these top-down processes and their role in social stimulus classification. In a neuroimaging study with 45 healthy participants, we employed a social adaptation of the Implicit Association Test. Attentional focus was modified via the classification task, which compared two domains of social perception (emotion and gender), using the exactly same stimulus set. Supramodal memory representations were addressed via congruency of the target categories for the classification of auditory and visual social stimuli (voices and faces). Functional magnetic resonance imaging identified attention-specific and supramodal networks. Emotion classification networks included bilateral anterior insula, pre-supplementary motor area, and right inferior frontal gyrus. They were pure attention-driven and independent from stimulus modality or congruency of the target concepts. No neural contribution of supramodal memory representations could be revealed for emotion classification. In contrast, gender classification relied on supramodal memory representations in rostral anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. In summary, different domains of social perception involve different top-down processes which take place in clearly distinguishable neural networks.},

Over the past years, a multitude of studies have addressed the question of how affective cues conveyed by auditory and visual channels are integrated. Behavioral studies show that hearing and seeing emotional expressions can support and influence each other, a notion which is supported by investigations on the underlying neurobiology. Numerous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions subserving the integration of multimodal emotions and have provided new insights into the neural processing steps underlying the synergistic confluence of affective information from voice and face. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review covering current behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging findings on the combination of emotions from the auditory and visual domains. Behavioral advantages arising from multimodal redundancy are paralleled by specific integration patterns on the neural level, from encoding in early sensory cortices to late cognitive evaluation in higher association areas. In summary, these findings indicate that bimodal emotions interact at multiple stages of the audiovisual integration process.},

Given the holistic nature of the spiral curriculum, we assumed that a purely digital model would have an impact on knowledge acquisition due to missing hands-on learning opportunities. The aim of the study was to investigate, using an emergency seminar as an example, whether purely digital training leads to a difference in theoretical knowledge compared to the traditional model. Study design: We used a two-groups design comparing a sample of medical students taught in 2020 with a purely digital teaching format (DF;  Students in the DF group scored significantly lower than students in the TF group in the final exams. Students in the DF group rated the course significantly worse than students in the TF group. The study results illustrate that purely digital education leads to inferior knowledge acquisition compared to the traditional spiral curriculum. A possible explanation may lie in a deeper processing of the information (e.g., understanding the information by experience and analysis) and accordingly a better memory recall. Moreover, the students' critical appraisal of the DF may have had an unfavorable effect on learning performance. Moderating factors may be lower learning motivation or the "zoom fatigue" effect. These study results clearly illustrate the importance of hands-on teaching for knowledge acquisition.

These VEs can offer great flexibility, replicability, and control over the presented stimuli in an immersive setting. With recent developments, it has become feasible to achieve higher-quality visuals and VEs at a reasonable investment. Our aim in this project was to develop and implement a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI)-based neurofeedback (NF) training paradigm, taking into account new technological advances that allow us to integrate complex stimuli into a visually updated and engaging VE. We built upon and developed a first-person shooter in which the dynamic change of the VE was the feedback variable in the brain-computer interface (BCI). We designed a study to assess the feasibility of the BCI in creating an immersive VE for NF training. In a randomized single-blinded fMRI-based NF-training session, 24 participants were randomly allocated into one of two groups: active and reduced contingency NF. All participants completed three runs of the shooter-game VE lasting 10 min each. Brain activity in a supplementary motor area region of interest regulated the possible movement speed of the player's avatar and thus increased the reward probability. The gaming performance revealed that the participants were able to actively engage in game tasks and improve across sessions. All 24 participants reported being able to successfully employ NF strategies during the training while performing in-game tasks with significantly higher perceived NF control ratings in the NF group. Spectral analysis showed significant differential effects on brain activity between the groups. Connectivity analysis revealed significant differences, showing a lowered connectivity in the NF group compared to the reduced contingency-NF group. The self-assessment manikin ratings showed an increase in arousal in both groups but failed significance. Arousal has been linked to presence, or feelings of immersion, supporting the VE's objective. Long paradigms, such as NF in MRI settings, can lead to mental fatigue; therefore, VEs can help overcome such limitations. The rewarding achievements from gaming targets can lead to implicit learning of self-regulation and may broaden the scope of NF applications.},

We examined the effect of this task-switching requirement on chest-compression quality to gain insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying performance in standard CPR. Understanding these mechanisms can help in the development of evidence-based practical implications and cognitive aids for CPR. A total of 300 first-year medical and dentistry students (212 females, 20.2 ± 4.4 years) participated in this randomized controlled trial. They received either a CPR training comprising both chest compressions and ventilation (standard CPR) or a CPR training comprising chest compressions only (chest-compression-only CPR). Chest-compression quality (compression depth and rate) was measured via a resuscitation manikin and analyzed using linear mixed models and linear trend analyses. Overall, chest-compression quality did not differ across standard CPR and chest-compression-only CPR. However, in standard CPR, compression quality was better after ventilation than before ventilation. Importantly, ventilation impaired the quality of the compressions executed immediately after ventilation, but the quality increased with each compression after ventilation, resulting in a better chest-compression quality after ventilation than before it. This study suggests that ventilation acts as a break, improving physical capability, which in turn enhances compressions after ventilation. However, at the same time, ventilation causes a task switch which increases cognitive demands and impairs chest-compression quality immediately after ventilation. Considering the negative effect of the task-switching demand on chest-compression quality, it is useful to develop cognitive aids for professional medical care. Such cognitive aids can signal an upcoming switch to ventilation, thereby reducing the multitasking load in terms of reduced monitoring demands with respect to the number of chest compressions that have already been executed.},

In VAPF, participants video-recorded each other while performing a wound dressing and gave each other feedback assisted by a standardized checklist. Outcome measures were participants' score in an objective structured practical examination (OSPE) and a written exam after the course. Noninferiority of VAPF (n = 123) compared to QIF (n = 127) was confirmed for both OSPE (QIF: 8.83 ± 1.30; VAPF: 8.88 ± 1.04; mean difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.25) and written exam (QIF: 8.99 ± 1.06; VAPF: 9.14 ± 1.05; mean difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.12). VAPF is a cost-efficient and viable alternative to QIF commonly used in medical education. It provides comparable training outcomes to the traditional training method with lower personnel investment.

Our objectives were (1) to examine whether peer feedback BLS training supported by tele-instructors matches the learning performance of standard instructor-guided BLS training for laypersons; and (2) to minimize infection risk during BLS training. Therefore, in a parallel group design, we compared arm (1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) BLS training (Historical control group of 2019) with arm (2) a Tele-Instructor Supported Peer-Feedback (TPF) BLS training (Intervention group of 2020). Both study arms were based on Peyton's 4-step approach. Before and after each training session, objective data for BLS performance (compression depth and rate) were recorded using a resuscitation manikin. We also assessed overall BLS performance via standardized instructor evaluation and student self-reports of confidence via questionnaire. Non-inferiority margins for the outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with SIF. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority. The results confirmed non-inferiority of TPF to SIF for all tested outcome parameters. A follow-up after 2 weeks found no confirmed COVID-19 infections among the participants. Tele-instructor supported peer feedback is a powerful alternative to in-person instructor feedback on BLS skills during a pandemic, where infection risk needs to be minimized while maximizing the quality of BLS skill learning. https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00025199, Trial ID: DRKS00025199.},

  abstract = {The transition of patients from the intensive care unit (ICU) to the palliative care (PC) ward often implies changes including establishing a palliative concept. Adaptation of therapeutic goals can be challenging for medical staff, patients and relatives; however, descriptions of these transition trajectories are rare. The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize the consultation requests of the ICU to the PC consultation team as well as the patients by a description of trajectories and interventions. Retrospective analysis of all patients receiving intensive care at RWTH Aachen University Hospital in 2019 for whom a PC consultation was requested. The patient population transferred from the ICU to the PC ward was compared with the non-transferred population. In each case, the primary consultation was evaluated regarding the following factors: question, vigilance, length of time from consultation request to its performance, and primary focus of the question. The question focus was categorized into "symptom control", "counselling" and "transfer" (tick options). In addition, a free text field was available for further notes. Exploration of diagnoses was complemented by accessing the electronic health records. A total of 102 consultation requests from the ICU to the PC ward were evaluated. The morbidity of patients was high, and most patients had at least one of the following diagnoses: pulmonary (62%), cardiovascular (61%), and/or neurological disease (55%). Of the patients 32 (31%) were transferred to the PC ward, among whom weakness (94%), fatigue (77%), anxiety (55%), pain (53%), and dyspnea (48%) were the most frequently noted symptoms. Of the transferred patients 5 (16%) could be discharged to home, nursing home, hospice or other. In total, 35 (34%) of all patients who were seen by palliative care specialists on ICUs in 2019 could be discharged alive. The most frequent reasons for nonadmission were lack of capacity of the PC ward (33%), dying while being on the waiting list (20%), and refusal by the patient (20%). Of the patients, 7 (26%) died within 48 h after they had been transferred to the PC ward. Performed consultation services "symptom control" (χ The need for palliative care support in the ICUs exceeded the admission capacity of the PC ward. Future studies should further examine palliative care models in intensive care medicine.},

  abstract = {Traumatic experiences are associated with neurofunctional dysregulations in key regions of the emotion regulation circuits. In particular, amygdala responsivity to negative stimuli is exaggerated while engagement of prefrontal regulatory control regions is attenuated. Successful application of emotion regulation (ER) strategies may counteract this disbalance, however, application of learned strategies in daily life is hampered in individuals afflicted by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized that a single session of real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) guided upregulation of prefrontal regions during an emotion regulation task enhances self-control during exposure to negative stimuli and facilitates transfer of the learned ER skills to daily life. In a cross-over design, individuals with a PTSD diagnosis after a single traumatic event (n = 20) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria and individuals without a formal psychiatric diagnosis (n = 21) underwent a cognitive reappraisal training. In randomized order, all participants completed two rtfMRI neurofeedback (NF) runs targeting the left lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and two control runs without NF (NoNF) while using cognitive reappraisal to reduce their emotional response to negative scenes. During the NoNF runs, two %%-signs were displayed instead of the two-digit feedback (FB) to achieve a comparable visual stimulation. The project aimed at defining the clinical potential of the training according to three success markers: (1) NF induced changes in left lateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala activity during the regulation of aversive scenes compared to cognitive reappraisal alone (primary registered outcome), (2) associated changes on the symptomatic and behavioral level such as indicated by PTSD symptom severity and affect ratings, (3) clinical utility such as indicated by perceived efficacy, acceptance, and transfer to daily life measured four weeks after the training. In comparison to the reappraisal without feedback, a neurofeedback-specific decrease in the left lateral PFC (d = 0.54) alongside an attenuation of amygdala responses (d = 0.33) emerged. Reduced amygdala responses during NF were associated with symptom improvement (r = -0.42) and less negative affect (r = -0.63) at follow-up. The difference in symptom scores exceeds requirements for a minimal clinically important difference and corresponds to a medium effect size (d = 0.64). Importantly, 75% of individuals with PTSD used the strategies in daily life during a one-month follow-up period and perceived the training as efficient. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of the NF training indicated by reduced amygdala responses that were associated with improved symptom severity and affective state four weeks after the NF training as well as patient-centered perceived control during the training, helpfulness and application of strategies in daily life. However, reduced prefrontal involvement was unexpected. The study suggests good tolerability of the training protocol and potential for clinical use in the treatment of PTSD.},

  abstract = {Social interactions arise from patterns of communicative signs, whose perception and interpretation require a multitude of cognitive functions. The semiotic framework of Peirce's Universal Categories (UCs) laid ground for a novel cognitive-semiotic typology of social interactions. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 16 volunteers watched a movie narrative encompassing verbal and non-verbal social interactions. Three types of non-verbal interactions were coded ("unresolved," "non-habitual," and "habitual") based on a typology reflecting Peirce's UCs. As expected, the auditory cortex responded to verbal interactions, but non-verbal interactions modulated temporal areas as well. Conceivably, when speech was lacking, ambiguous visual information (unresolved interactions) primed auditory processing in contrast to learned behavioral patterns (habitual interactions). The latter recruited a parahippocampal-occipital network supporting conceptual processing and associative memory retrieval. Requesting semiotic contextualization, non-habitual interactions activated visuo-spatial and contextual rule-learning areas such as the temporo-parietal junction and right lateral prefrontal cortex. In summary, the cognitive-semiotic typology reflected distinct sensory and association networks underlying the interpretation of observed non-verbal social interactions.},

It was demonstrated that playing a video game leads to striatal dopamine release. It is unclear, however, which aspects of the game cause this reward system activation and if violent content contributes to it. We combined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with individual affect measures to address the neuronal correlates of violence in a video game. Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during fMRI measurement. We defined success as eliminating opponents, and failure as being eliminated themselves. Affect was measured directly before and after game play using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Failure and success events evoked increased activity in visual cortex but only failure decreased activity in orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus. A negative correlation between negative affect and responses to failure was evident in the right temporal pole (rTP). The deactivation of the caudate nucleus during failure is in accordance with its role in reward-prediction error: it occurred whenever subject missed an expected reward (being eliminated rather than eliminating the opponent). We found no indication that violence events were directly rewarding for the players. We addressed subjective evaluations of affect change due to gameplay to study the reward system. Subjects reporting greater negative affect after playing the game had less rTP activity associated with failure. The rTP may therefore be involved in evaluating the failure events in a social context, to regulate the players' mood.},

Aim of the present study was to investigate whether aggressive behavior has a rewarding value by itself. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was measured in fifteen right-handed males while playing the video game Carmageddon. Neuroimaging data were analyzed based on violent and non-violent success and failure events. Correlations with subjective game experience measured brain-behavior and -affect relationships. Results revealed a differential involvement of the striatal reward system: non-violent success elicited activation of the ventral striatum, whereas violent success activated specifically the dorsal striatum. Subjective game experience correlated with putamen and medial prefrontal cortex activation specifically for violent success. These results emphasize a differential neural processing of violent and non-violent success events in dorsal and ventral striatum. Virtual violence seems to enable selective responses of the reward system and positive in-game experience.},

Alternative cost-efficient and effective training methods are highly needed. The present study evaluated whether a video-feedback supported peer-guided Basic Life Support training approach achieves similar practical performance as a standard instructor-guided training in laypersons. In a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial, 288 first-year medical students were randomized to two study arms with different Basic Life Support training methods: 1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) or 2) a Peer Video Feedback (PVF). Outcome parameters were objective data for Basic Life Support performance (compression depth and rate) from a resuscitation manikin with recording software as well as overall Basic Life Support performance and subjective confidence. Non-inferiority margins (Δ) for these outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with Standard Instructor Feedback. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority. Results confirmed non-inferiority of Peer Video Feedback to Standard Instructor Feedback for compression depth (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 2.9%; 95% CI: -8.2% to 14.1%; Δ = -19%), overall Basic Life Support performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 6.7%; 95% CI: 0.0% to 14.3%; Δ = -27%) and subjective confidence for CPR performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.01; 95% CI: -0.18-0.17; Δ = -0.5) and emergency situations (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.02; 95% CI: -0.21-0.18; Δ = -0.5). Results for compression rate were inconclusive. Peer Video Feedback achieves comparable results as standard instructor-based training methods. It is an easy-to-apply and cost-efficient alternative to standard Basic Life Support training methods. To improve performance with respect to compression rate, additional implementation of a metronome is recommended.},

This study investigated whether a virtual operating room tour (VORT) before surgery can be used to ameliorate perioperative anxiety. We employed a randomized parallel-group design with 2 study arms to compare VORT to the standard operation preparation procedure. The study included 84 patients. A validated inventory (state-trait operation anxiety-state) was used to assess perioperative state anxiety before (T1) and after (T2) surgery. In addition, trait operation anxiety was evaluated with an additional validated inventory (state-trait operation anxiety-trait). Moreover, user ratings on the usefulness of VORT were assessed with an evaluation questionnaire. Study arms were compared for perioperative state anxiety with two-tailed independent samples t tests. Subjective ratings were correlated with STOA-Trait values to investigate possible associations between perioperative anxiety with perceived usefulness. There were no significant differences in perioperative state anxiety between VORT and standard operation preparation procedures before and after the surgery. Nonetheless, patients' ratings of VORT overall were positive. The tour was perceived as useful and, therefore, showed acceptance for VR use. These ratings were unrelated to the degree of perioperative anxiety. The subjective benefit of VORT could not be explained by a reduction of perioperative anxiety. Instead, VORT appears to serve the need for information and reduce uncertainty. In addition, VORT is perceived as beneficial regardless of the age of the patients. Considering this effect and the manageable organizational and financial effort toward implementation, the general use of VORT can be recommended.

In contrast to linguistic symbols (e.g., spoken words or signs in sign language) relying on mostly explicit conventions, gestures vary in their degree of conventionality. Bodily signs may have a general accepted or conventionalized meaning (e.g., a head shake) or less so (e.g., self-grooming). We hypothesized that subjective perception of conventionality in co-speech gestures relies on the classical language network, i.e., the left hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Broca's area) and the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG, Wernicke's area) and studied 36 subjects watching video-recorded story retellings during a behavioral and an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. It is well documented that neural correlates of such naturalistic videos emerge as intersubject covariance (ISC) in fMRI even without involving a stimulus (model-free analysis). The subjects attended either to perceived conventionality or to a control condition (any hand movements or gesture-speech relations). Such tasks modulate ISC in contributing neural structures and thus we studied ISC changes to task demands in language networks. Indeed, the conventionality task significantly increased covariance of the button press time series and neuronal synchronization in the left IFG over the comparison with other tasks. In the left IFG, synchronous activity was observed during the conventionality task only. In contrast, the left pSTG exhibited correlated activation patterns during all conditions with an increase in the conventionality task at the trend level only. Conceivably, the left IFG can be considered a core region for the processing of perceived conventionality in co-speech gestures similar to spoken language. In general, the interpretation of conventionalized signs may rely on neural mechanisms that engage during language comprehension.},

Flow theory is a well-established model developed to describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii) direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and motivational processes during media entertainment.},

Implementing information from only one electrode, however, may miss relevant information from complex electrophysiological networks. Component based analysis, in turn, depends on a priori knowledge of the signal topography. Complex designs such as studies on multisensory integration of emotions investigate subtle differences in distributed networks based on only a few trials per condition. Thus, they require a sensitive and comprehensive approach which does not rely on a-priori knowledge about the underlying neural processes. In this pilot study, feasibility and sensitivity of source localization-driven analysis for EEG-fMRI was tested using a multisensory integration paradigm. Dynamic audiovisual stimuli consisting of emotional talking faces and pseudowords with emotional prosody were rated in a delayed response task. The trials comprised affectively congruent and incongruent displays. In addition to event-locked EEG and fMRI analyses, induced oscillatory EEG responses at estimated cortical sources and in specific temporo-spectral windows were correlated with the corresponding BOLD responses. EEG analysis showed high data quality with less than 10% trial rejection. In an early time window, alpha oscillations were suppressed in bilateral occipital cortices and fMRI analysis confirmed high data quality with reliable activation in auditory, visual and frontal areas to the presentation of multisensory stimuli. In line with previous studies, we obtained reliable correlation patterns for event locked occipital alpha suppression and BOLD signal time course. Our results suggest a valid methodological approach to investigate complex stimuli using the present source localization driven method for EEG-fMRI. This novel procedure may help to investigate combined EEG-fMRI data from novel complex paradigms with high spatial and temporal resolution.},

In particular, studies indicate altered functional coupling between nodes of the language and default mode networks. Neurofeedback based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) can be used to modulate such aberrant network connectivity. We investigated resting-state connectivity changes after neurofeedback (NF) in 21 patients with schizophrenia and 35 healthy individuals. All participants underwent two days of neurofeedback training of important nodes of the left-hemispheric language network including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). In a double-blind randomized cross-over design, participants learned to down- and up-regulate their brain activation in the designated target regions based on NF. Prior to and after each training day, a resting state measurement took place. Coupling between nodes of the language and the default mode network (DMN) selectively increased after down-as compared to up-regulation NF. Network analyses revealed more pronounced increases in functional connectivity between nodes of the language network and the DMN in patients compared to healthy individuals. In particular, down-regulation NF led to increased coupling between nodes of the language network and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (IPL) as well as posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus in patients. Up-regulation strengthened connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Improved well-being four weeks after the training predicted increased functional coupling between the left IFG and left IPL. Modulatory effects emerged as increased internetwork communication, indicating that down-regulation NF selectively enhances coupling between language and DM network nodes in patients with AVH. RtfMRI NF may thus be used to modulate brain network function that is relevant to the phenomenology of AVH. Specific effects of self-regulation on symptom improvement have to be explored in therapeutic interventions.},

Using novel computer-generated stimuli, we combined emotional faces and voices in congruent and incongruent ways and assessed functional brain data (fMRI) during an emotional classification task. Both congruent and incongruent audiovisual stimuli evoked larger responses in thalamus and superior temporal regions compared with unimodal conditions. Congruent emotions were characterized by activation in amygdala, insula, ventral posterior cingulate (vPCC), temporo-occipital, and auditory cortices; incongruent emotions activated a frontoparietal network and bilateral caudate nucleus, indicating a greater processing load in working memory and emotion-encoding areas. The vPCC alone exhibited differential reactions to congruency and incongruency for all emotion categories and can thus be considered a central structure for supramodal representation of complex emotional information. Moreover, the left amygdala reflected supramodal representation of happy stimuli. These findings document that emotional information does not merge at the perceptual audiovisual integration level in unimodal or multimodal areas, but in vPCC and amygdala.},

  abstract = {Cognitive functioning is impaired in patients with schizophrenia, leading to significant disabilities in everyday functioning. Its improvement is an important treatment target. Neurofeedback (NF) seems a promising method to address the neural dysfunctions underlying those cognitive impairments. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a central hub for cognitive processing, is one of the brain regions known to be dysfunctional in schizophrenia. Here we conducted NF training based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with schizophrenia to enable them to control their ACC activity. Training was performed over 3 days in a group of 11 patients with schizophrenia and 11 healthy controls. Social feedback was provided in accordance with the evoked activity in the selected region of interest (ROI). Neural and cognitive strategies were examined off-line. Both groups learned to control the activity of their ACC but used different neural strategies: patients activated the dorsal and healthy controls the rostral subdivision. Patients mainly used imagination of music to elicit activity and the control group imagination of sports. In a stepwise regression analysis, the difference in neural control did not result from the differences in cognitive strategies but from diagnosis alone. Based on social reinforcers, patients with schizophrenia can learn to regulate localized brain activity. However, cognitive strategies and neural network location differ from healthy controls. These data emphasize that for therapeutic interventions in patients with schizophrenia compensatory strategies may emerge. Specific cognitive skills or specific dysfunctional networks should be addressed to train impaired skills. Social NF based on fMRI may be one method to accomplish precise learning targets.},

  abstract = {The AAA-type ATPase VPS4 is recruited by proteins of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRT-III) to catalyse membrane constriction and membrane fission. VPS4A accumulates at the cytoplasmic viral assembly complex (cVAC) of cells infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the site where nascent virus particles obtain their membrane envelope. Here we show that VPS4A is recruited to the cVAC via interaction with pUL71. Sequence analysis, deep-learning structure prediction, molecular dynamics and mutagenic analysis identify a short peptide motif in the C-terminal region of pUL71 that is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with VPS4A. This motif is predicted to bind the same groove of the N-terminal VPS4A Microtubule-Interacting and Trafficking (MIT) domain as the Type 2 MIT-Interacting Motif (MIM2) of cellular ESCRT-III components, and this viral MIM2-like motif (vMIM2) is conserved across β-herpesvirus pUL71 homologues. However, recruitment of VPS4A by pUL71 is dispensable for HCMV morphogenesis or replication and the function of the conserved vMIM2 during infection remains enigmatic. VPS4-recruitment via a vMIM2 represents a previously unknown mechanism of molecular mimicry in viruses, extending previous observations that herpesviruses encode proteins with structural and functional homology to cellular ESCRT-III components.},

ARA290 is renoprotective in renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). In a renal I/R model we focussed on timing of post-reperfusional administration of ARA290. Furthermore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of ARA290. Twenty-six male Lewis/HanHsd rats were exposed to unilateral ischemia for 30 minutes, with subsequent removal of the contralateral kidney. Post-reperfusion, ARA290 was administered early (one hour), late (four hours) or repetitive (one and four hours). Saline was used as vehicle treatment. Rats were sacrificed after three days. Early ARA290 treatment improved renal function. Late- or repetitive treatment tended to improve clinical markers. Furthermore, early ARA290 treatment reduced renal inflammation and acute kidney injury at three days post-reperfusion. Late- or repetitive treatment did not affect inflammation or acute kidney injury. ARA290 attenuated renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study showed the anti-inflammatory effect of ARA290 and suggests early administration in the post-reperfusional phase is most effective. ARA290 is a candidate drug for protection against ischemic injury following renal transplantation.},

Multiple donor arteries [OR 2.79 (1.15-6.79)] and obesity [OR 2.85 (1.19-6.82)] were identified as potential risk factors for TEC. Bleeding occurred in 88 patients (4.4%) and incidence varied significantly between different antithrombotic therapies (P = 0.006). Cardiovascular disease [OR 2.01 (1.18-3.42)], pre-emptive KTx [OR 2.23 (1.28-3.89)], postoperative heparin infusion [OR 1.69 (1.00-2.85)], and vitamin K antagonists [OR 6.60 (2.95-14.77)] were associated with an increased bleeding risk. Intraoperative heparin and antiplatelet therapy were not associated with increased bleeding risk. These regimens appear to be safe for the possible prevention of TEC without increasing the risk for bleeding after KTx.},

Reperfusion takes place in the recipient and most of the injury following ischemia and reperfusion occurs during this reperfusion phase; therefore, the intra-operative period seems an attractive window of opportunity to modulate IRI and improve short- and potentially long-term graft outcome. Commonly used volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane and isoflurane have been shown to interfere with many of the pathophysiological processes involved in the injurious cascade of IRI. Therefore, volatile anesthetic (VA) agents might be the preferred anesthetics used during the transplantation procedure. This review highlights the molecular and cellular protective points of engagement of VA shown in in vitro studies and in vivo animal experiments, and the potential translation of these results to the clinical setting of kidney transplantation.},

Although several studies have investigated risk factors for the development of cognitive impairment in the early postoperative phase, risk factors for pNCD at 3 months have been less well studied. The aim of this study was to identify potential anaesthesia-related risk factors for pNCD at 3 months after surgery. We analysed data obtained for a prospective observational study in patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent surgery for excision of a solid tumour. Cognitive function was assessed preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively using 5 neuropsychological tests. Postoperative NCD was defined as a postoperative decline of ≥ 25% relative to baseline in ≥ 2 tests. The association between anaesthesia-related factors (type of anaesthesia, duration of anaesthesia, agents used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia and analgesia, the use of additional vasoactive medication, depth of anaesthesia [bispectral index] and mean arterial pressure) and pNCD was analysed using logistic regression analyses. Furthermore, the relation between anaesthesia-related factors and change in cognitive test scores expressed as a continuous variable was analysed using a z-score. Of the 196 included patients, 23 (12%) fulfilled the criteria for pNCD at 3 months postoperatively. A low preoperative score on Mini-Mental State Examination (OR, 8.9 [95% CI, (2.8-27.9)], p < 0.001) and a longer duration of anaesthesia (OR, 1.003 [95% CI, (1.001-1.005)], p = 0.013) were identified as risk factors for pNCD. On average, patients scored higher on postoperative tests (mean z-score 2.35[± 3.13]). In this cohort, duration of anaesthesia, which is probably an expression of the complexity of the surgery, was the only anaesthesia-related predictor of pNCD. On average, patients' scores on cognitive tests improved postoperatively.},

From this perspective, prehabilitation-a proactive, multimodal approach to enhance patients' functional, nutritional, and psychological status prior to surgery-has gained attention as a potential contributor to value-based, personalized care. This study aims to synthesize mechanistic rationale, clinical evidence, and system-level considerations for prehabilitation, with particular focus on allostatic capacity and the body's response to surgical stress. Current evidence shows that prehabilitation may reduce postoperative complications, shorten hospital stays, and improve functional recovery, particularly when interventions are multimodal. However, the existing literature is characterized by methodological heterogeneity and variable quality, seemingly limiting generalizability and large-scale implementation. Further research is required to standardize outcome measures, identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit, and evaluate cost-effectiveness. Integration of prehabilitation into perioperative care pathways will depend on improved mechanistic understanding, robust clinical trials, and alignment with broader health policy and system-level initiatives. Prehabilitation may represent a meaningful step toward value-based and sustainable surgical care, though its implementation must be guided by high-quality evidence and careful consideration of context-specific factors.},

This is an ongoing debate since more than 25 years, representing a scientific, cultural as well as geographical divide in the anesthesia community. The Pro side argues that total intravenous anesthesia causes less postoperative nausea and higher patient satisfaction than anesthesia using volatile anesthetics. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of anesthetic agents allows for better titration of intravenous anesthesia using pharmacokinetic models. Processed EEG monitors, such as bispectral index monitoring, allows for better assessing the effect of TCI anesthesia than solely assessment of clinical parameters, such as ECG or blood pressure. The combination of TCI propofol and objective depth of anesthesia monitoring allows creating a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile for each patient. Finally, anesthesia using volatile anesthetics poses health risks for healthcare professionals and contributes to greenhouse effect. The Con side argues that for procedures accompanied with ischemia and reperfusion injury of an organ or tissue and for patients suffering from a severe inflammation' the use of volatile anesthetics might well have its advantages above propofol. In times of sudden shortage of drugs, volatile anesthetics can overcome the restriction in the operating theater or even on the intensive care unit, which is another advantage. Volatile anesthetics can be used for induction of anesthesia when IV access is impossible, end-tidal measurements of volatile anesthetic concentration allows confirmation that patients receive anesthetics. Taking environmental considerations into account, both propofol and volatile anesthetics bear certain harm to the environment, be it as waste product or as greenhouse gases. The authors therefore suggest to carefully considering advantages and disadvantages for each patient in its according environment. A well-balanced choice based on the available literature is recommended. The authors recommend careful consideration of advantages and disadvantages of each technique when tailoring an anesthetic to meet patient needs. Where appropriate, anesthesia providers are encouraged to account for unique features of anesthetic drug behavior, patient-reported and observed postoperative outcomes, and economic and environmental considerations when choosing any of the 2 described techniques.},

Ischemic conditioning is an inherent part of the renal defense mechanism against ischemia and can be triggered by short periods of intermittent ischemia and reperfusion. Understanding the signaling transduction pathways of renal ischemic conditioning can promote further clinical translation and pharmacological advancements in this era. This review summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms underlying both local and remote ischemic pre-, per- and postconditioning of the kidney. The different types of conditioning strategies in the kidney recruit similar powerful pro-survival mechanisms. Likewise, renal ischemic conditioning mobilizes many of the same protective signaling pathways as in other organs, but differences are recognized.},

To study its dynamics in kidney transplant recipients (KTR), we determined whether the degree of frailty and its domains are affected by kidney transplantation (KT). Between 2015 and 2017, 176 KTR were included. Frailty scores were measured using the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), assessed preoperatively and during follow-up. Transitions in frailty state and changes in the individual domains were determined. Mean age (±SD) was 51.8 (± 14.1) years, and 63.1% of KTR were male. Thirty patients were considered frail (GFI ≥ 4) at baseline. After a mean follow-up of 22.8 ± 8.3 months, 34 non-frail patients (19.3%) became frail, 125 patients (71.0%) remained the same, and 17 frail patients (9.7%) became non-frail (GFI < 4). In the domain psychosocial functioning, 28.4% of the patients had an increase in GFI score after follow-up. Patients who scored a point in the domain cognition at baseline had a greater chance of becoming frail (OR 4.38, 95% CI 0.59-32.24). In conclusion, almost one-fifth of non-frail KTR transitioned to a frail state after their transplantation. These results could be used to predict the impact of KT on frailty course and help with implementing prehabilitation for patients at risk.},

However, data regarding the efficacy of antithrombotic therapy in the prevention of renal graft thrombosis are scarce. Adequate antithrombotic management requires a good understanding of the pathophysiological changes in the hemostatic system in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Specifically, ESKD and dialysis disrupt the fine balance between pro- and anticoagulation in the body, and further changes in the hemostatic system occur during kidney transplantation. Consequently, kidney transplant recipients paradoxically are at risk for both thrombosis and bleeding. This overview focuses on the pathophysiological changes in hemostasis in ESKD and kidney transplantation and provides a comprehensive summary of the current evidence for antithrombotic management in (adult) kidney transplant recipients.},

  abstract = {During ischemia−reperfusion injury (IRI), reactive oxygen species are produced that can be scavenged by free sulfhydryl groups (R-SH, free thiols). In this study, we hypothesized that R-SH levels decrease as a consequence of renal IRI and that R-SH levels reflect post-transplant graft function. Systemic venous, arterial, renal venous, and urinary samples were collected in donors and recipients before, during, and after transplantation. R-SH was measured colorimetrically. Systemic arterial R-SH levels in recipients increased significantly up to 30 sec after reperfusion (p < 0.001). In contrast, renal venous R-SH levels significantly decreased at 5 and 10 min compared to 30 sec after reperfusion (both p < 0.001). This resulted in a significant decrease in delta R-SH (defined as the difference between renal venous and systemic arterial R-SH levels) till 30 sec after reperfusion (p < 0.001), indicating a net decrease in R-SH levels across the transplanted kidney. Overall, these results suggest trans-renal oxidative stress as a consequence of IRI during kidney transplantation, reflected by systemic and renal changes in R-SH levels in transplant recipients.},

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the quality of evidence of the included studies, determine the prevalence of frailty among kidney transplant candidates, and evaluate the relationship between frailty and associated patient characteristics and outcomes after kidney transplantation. A systematic search was performed for relevant literature on frailty and kidney transplantation. This was followed by a meta-analysis for patient characteristics and outcomes reported by a minimum of 2 studies including mean age, gender, mean body mass index, type of kidney transplantation, dialysis, previous kidney transplantation, comorbidities, hypertension, race, preemptive kidney transplantation, delayed graft function, and length of stay. A total of 18 studies were included in the systematic review and 14 of those studies were suitable for meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of frailty before transplantation was estimated at 17.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.4-18.7). Frailty was significantly associated with higher age (mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-5.9), lower rate of preemptive transplantation (relative risk, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9), longer duration of delayed graft function (relative risk, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0), and length of stay longer than 2 wk (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3). One in 6 kidney transplant recipients is frail before transplantation. The presence of frailty is associated with lower rates of preemptive transplantation, older recipient age, higher rates of delayed graft function, and longer length of stay. Future research is required to explore the association of frailty with other adverse outcomes after kidney transplantation and the effects of intervention programs to improve the different frailty domains.},

Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) improved early kidney graft function in a porcine model of donation after brain death and was associated with improved long-term cardiac outcome after myocardial ischaemia. This randomised, double-blinded trial evaluated the effect of RIC on kidney graft outcome in the first year, and examined the predictive value of a new measure of initial kidney graft function, i.e. the estimated time to a 50% reduction in plasma creatinine post-transplantation (tCr50). A total of 225 patients undergoing deceased donor kidney transplantation were randomised to RIC or a sham procedure performed prior to kidney reperfusion. Up to four repetitive cycles of five minutes of leg ischaemia and five minutes of reperfusion were given. GFR, plasma creatinine, cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured at three and twelve months and estimated GFR was calculated using four different equations. Other secondary outcomes were identified from patient files. RIC did not affect GFR or other outcomes when compared to the sham procedure at three or twelve months. tCr50 correlated with one year graft function (p<0.0001 for both mGFR and eGFR estimates). In contrast, DGF i.e. "need of dialysis the first week" did not correlate significantly with one year GFR. RIC during deceased donor kidney transplantation did not improve one year outcome. However, tCr50 may be a relevant marker for studies aiming to improve graft onset. www.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01395719.},

Eight female Dutch Landrace pigs were exposed to unilateral renal ischemia for 45 minutes with simultaneous cannulation of the ureter of the ischemic kidney. ARA290 or saline was administered by an intravenous injection at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-reperfusion. The animals were sacrificed seven days post-reperfusion. ARA290 increased glomerular filtration rate during the observation period of seven days. Furthermore, ARA290 tended to reduce MCP-1 and IL-6 expression 15 minutes post-reperfusion. Seven days post-reperfusion ARA290 reduced interstitial fibrosis.

The hydrolysed samples showed comparative toxicity as the free fatty acids and no difference between algal and fish oil. Oxidative stress was shown to play a role in the antiproliferative properties of EPA and DHA, as alpha-tocopherol could partially reverse the EPA/DHA-induced effects.

  abstract = {Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an important staple food. However, wheat gluten proteins cause celiac disease (CD) in 0.5 to 1% of the general population. Among these proteins, the alpha-gliadins contain several peptides that are associated to the disease. We obtained 230 distinct alpha-gliadin gene sequences from severaldiploid wheat species representing the ancestral A, B, and D genomes of the hexaploid bread wheat. The large majority of these sequences (87%) contained an internal stop codon. All alpha-gliadin sequences could be distinguished according to the genome of origin on the basis of sequence similarity, of the average length of the polyglutamine repeats, and of the differences in the presence of four peptides that have been identified as T cell stimulatory epitopes in CD patients through binding to HLA-DQ2/8. By sequence similarity, alpha-gliadins from the public database of hexaploid T. aestivum could be assigned directly to chromosome 6A, 6B, or 6D. T. monococcum (A genome) sequences, as well as those from chromosome 6A of bread wheat, almost invariably contained epitope glia-alpha9 and glia-alpha20, but never the intact epitopes glia-alpha and glia-alpha2. A number of sequences from T. speltoides, as well as a number of sequences fromchromosome 6B of bread wheat, did not contain any of the four T cell epitopes screened for. The sequences from T. tauschii (D genome), as well as those from chromosome 6D of bread wheat, were found to contain all of these T cell epitopes in variable combinations per gene. The differences in epitope composition resulted mainly from point mutations. These substitutions appeared to be genome specific. Our analysis shows that alpha-gliadin sequences from the three genomes of bread wheat form distinct groups. The four known T cell stimulatory epitopes are distributed non-randomly across the sequences, indicating that the three genomes contribute differently to epitope content. A systematic analysis of all known epitopes in gliadins and glutenins will lead to better understanding of the differences in toxicity among wheat varieties. On the basis of such insight, breeding strategies can be designed to generate less toxic varieties of wheat which may be tolerated by at least part of the CD patient population.},

  abstract = {Flavonoids comprise a large family of secondary plant metabolic intermediates that exhibit a wide variety of antioxidant and human health-related properties. Plant production of flavonoids is limited by the low productivity and the complexity of the recovered flavonoids. Thus to overcome these limitations, metabolic engineering of specific pathway in microbial systems have been envisaged to produce high quantity of a single molecules. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to produce the key intermediate flavonoid, naringenin, solely from glucose. For this, specific naringenin biosynthesis genes from Arabidopsis thaliana were selected by comparative expression profiling and introduced in S. cerevisiae. The sole expression of these A. thaliana genes yielded low extracellular naringenin concentrations (<5.5 μM). To optimize naringenin titers, a yeast chassis strain was developed. Synthesis of aromatic amino acids was deregulated by alleviating feedback inhibition of 3-deoxy-d-arabinose-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (Aro3, Aro4) and byproduct formation was reduced by eliminating phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (Aro10, Pdc5, Pdc6). Together with an increased copy number of the chalcone synthase gene and expression of a heterologous tyrosine ammonia lyase, these modifications resulted in a 40-fold increase of extracellular naringenin titers (to approximately 200 μM) in glucose-grown shake-flask cultures. In aerated, pH controlled batch reactors, extracellular naringenin concentrations of over 400 μM were reached. The results reported in this study demonstrate that S. cerevisiae is capable of de novo production of naringenin by coexpressing the naringenin production genes from A. thaliana and optimization of the flux towards the naringenin pathway. The engineered yeast naringenin production host provides a metabolic chassis for production of a wide range of flavonoids and exploration of their biological functions.},

In CD patients gluten-derived peptides are presented to the immune system, which leads to a CD4+ T-cell mediated immune response and inflammation of the small intestine. However, not all gluten proteins contain T-cell stimulatory epitopes. Gluten proteins are encoded by multigene loci present on chromosomes 1 and 6 of the three different genomes of hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) (AABBDD). The effects of deleting individual gluten loci on both the level of T-cell stimulatory epitopes in the gluten proteome and the technological properties of the flour were analyzed using a set of deletion lines of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. The reduction of T-cell stimulatory epitopes was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies that recognize T-cell epitopes present in gluten proteins. The deletion lines were technologically tested with respect to dough mixing properties and dough rheology. The results show that removing the alpha-gliadin locus from the short arm of chromosome 6 of the D-genome (6DS) resulted in a significant decrease in the presence of T-cell stimulatory epitopes but also in a significant loss of technological properties. However, removing the omega-gliadin, gamma-gliadin, and LMW-GS loci from the short arm of chromosome 1 of the D-genome (1DS) removed T-cell stimulatory epitopes from the proteome while maintaining technological properties. The consequences of these data are discussed with regard to reducing the load of T-cell stimulatory epitopes in wheat, and to contributing to the design of CD-safe wheat varieties.},

In this study, two Arabidopsis UDP-galactose transporter cDNAs (UDP-GalT1 and UDP-GalT2) are isolated by expression cloning using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-Lec8) deficient in UDP-galactose transport. The isolated genes show only 21% identity to each other and very limited sequence identity with human and yeast UDP-galactose transporters and other NSTs. Despite this low overall identity, the two proteins clearly belong to the same gene family. Besides complementing Lec8 cells, the two NSTs are shown to transport exclusively UDP-galactose by an in vitro NST assay. The most homologous proteins with known function are plant transporters that locate in the inner chloroplast membrane and transport triose-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate, and xylulose 5-phosphate. Also, the latter proteins are members of the same family, which therefore has been named the NST/triose-phosphate transporter family.},

However, recently evidence has been provided for the presence of sialic acid in these evolutionary clades. In addition, homologs of mammalian genes involved in sialylation can be found in the genomes of these taxa and for some Drosophila enzymes, involvement in sialic acid metabolism has been documented. In plant genomes, homologs of sialyltransferase genes have been identified, but there activity could not be confirmed. Several mammalian cell lines exist with defects in the sialylation pathway. One of these is the Chinese hamster ovary cell line Lec2, deficient in CMP-sialic acid transport to the Golgi lumen. These mutants provide the possibility to clone genes by functional complementation. Using expression cloning, we have identified an Arabidopsis thaliana nucleotide sugar transporter that is able to complement the CMP-sialic acid transport deficiency of Lec2 cells. The isolated gene (At5g41760) is a member of the triose-phosphate/nucleotide sugar transporter gene family. Recombinant expression of the gene in yeast and testing in vitro confirmed its ability to transport CMP-sialic acid.},

From Citrus limon, four monoterpene synthase-encoding cDNAs for a beta-pinene synthase named Cl(-)betaPINS, a gamma-terpinene synthase named ClgammaTS, and two limonene synthases named Cl(+)LIMS1 and Cl(+)LIMS2 were recently isolated [J. Lücker et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 269 (2002) 3160]. The aim of our work in this study was to identify domains within these monoterpene synthase enzymes determining the product specificity. Domain swapping experiments between Cl(-)betaPINS and ClgammaTS and between Cl(+)LIMS2 and ClgammaTS were conducted. We found that within the C-terminal domain of these monoterpene synthases, a region comprising 200 amino acids, of which 41 are different between Cl(-)betaPINS and ClgammaTS, determines the specificity for the formation of beta-pinene or gamma-terpinene, respectively, while another region localized further downstream is required for a chimeric enzyme to yield products in the same ratio as in the wild-type ClgammaTS. For Cl(+)LIMS2, the two domains together appear to be sufficient for its enzyme specificity, but many chimeras were inactive probably due to the low homology with ClgammaTS. Molecular modeling was used to further pinpoint the amino acids responsible for the differences in product specificity of ClgammaTS and Cl(-)betaPINS.},

  abstract = {Production of pharmaceuticals in plants provides an alternative for chemical synthesis, fermentation or natural sources. Nicotiana benthamiana is deployed at commercial scale for production of therapeutic proteins. Here the potential of this plant is explored for rapid production of precursors of artemisinin, a sesquiterpenoid compound that is used for malaria treatment. Biosynthetic genes leading to artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin, were combined and expressed in N. benthamiana by agro-infiltration. The first committed precursor of artemisinin, amorpha-4,11-diene, was produced upon infiltration of a construct containing amorpha-4,11-diene synthase, accompanied by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Amorpha-4,11-diene was detected both in extracts and in the headspace of the N. benthamiana leaves. When the amorphadiene oxidase CYP71AV1 was co-infiltrated with the amorphadiene-synthesizing construct, the amorpha-4,11-diene levels strongly decreased, suggesting it was oxidized. Surprisingly, no anticipated oxidation products, such as artemisinic acid, were detected upon GC-MS analysis. However, analysis of leaf extracts with a non-targeted metabolomics approach, using LC-QTOF-MS, revealed the presence of another compound, which was identified as artemisinic acid-12-β-diglucoside. This compound accumulated to 39.5 mg x kg(-1) fwt. Apparently the product of the heterologous pathway that was introduced, artemisinic acid, is further metabolized efficiently by glycosyl transferases that are endogenous to N. benthamiana. This work shows that agroinfiltration of N. bentamiana can be used as a model to study the production of sesquiterpenoid pharmaceutical compounds. The interaction between the ectopically introduced pathway and the endogenous metabolism of the plant is discussed.},

The initial process for N-linked glycosylation shares a common pathway with assembly of a dolichol-linked core oligosaccharide. Here we characterize a new Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lew3 (leaf wilting 3), which has a defect in an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, a homolog of ALG11 in yeast, that transfers mannose to the dolichol-linked core oligosaccharide in the last two steps on the cytosolic face of the ER in N-glycan precursor synthesis. LEW3 is localized to the ER membrane and expressed throughout the plant. Mutation of LEW3 caused low-level accumulation of Man(3)GlcNAc(2) and Man(4)GlcNAc(2) glycans, structures that are seldom detected in wild-type plants. In addition, the lew3 mutant has low levels of normal high-mannose-type glycans, but increased levels of complex-type glycans. The lew3 mutant showed abnormal developmental phenotypes, reduced fertility, impaired cellulose synthesis, abnormal primary cell walls, and xylem collapse due to disturbance of the secondary cell walls. lew3 mutants were more sensitive to osmotic stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Protein N-glycosylation was reduced and the unfolded protein response was more activated by osmotic stress and ABA treatment in the lew3 mutant than in the wild-type. These results demonstrate that protein N-glycosylation plays crucial roles in plant development and the response to abiotic stresses.},

A radioallergosorbent test inhibition assay with proteins purified from leaves of WT and these transgenic tobacco plants using sera from allergic patients suggests a significant reduction of potential immunogenicity of xylGalT proteins. A mAb purified from leaves of plants expressing xylGalT displayed an N-glycan profile that featured high levels of galactose, undetectable xylose, and a trace of fucose. Hence, a transgenic plant expressing the hybrid GalT might yield more effective and safer monoclonals for therapeutic purposes than WT plants and even transgenic plants expressing the unchanged GalT.},

In contrast to AtGnTI-YFP, only low levels of HuGnTI-YFP protein was detected in transgenic plants. In protoplast co-transfection experiments all GnTI-YFP fusion proteins co-localized with a Golgi marker protein, but only limited co-localization of AtGnTI and HuGnTI in the same plant protoplast. The partial alternative targeting of HuGnTI in plant protoplasts was alleviated by exchanging the membrane-anchor domain with that of AtGnTI, but in stably transformed cgl1-1 plants this chimeric GnTI still did not lead to full complementation of the cgl1-1 phenotype. Combined, the results indicate that activity of HuGnTI in plants is limited by a combination of reduced protein stability, alternative protein targeting and possibly to some extend to lower enzymatic performance of the catalytic domain in the plant biochemical environment.},

These analyses revealed that most of the complex-type N-glycans in the plants expressing GnT-III were bisected and carried at least two terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in contrast to wild-type plants, where a considerable proportion of N-glycans did not contain GlcNAc residues at the nonreducing end.

Previously, we described an Arabidopsis alg3-2 glycosylation mutant in which aberrant Man(5)GlcNAc(2) mannose type N-glycans are transferred to proteins. Here we show that the alg3-2 mutation reduces the N-glycan heterogeneity on ER resident glycoproteins in seeds. We compared the properties of a scFv-Fc, with a KDEL ER retention tag (MBP10) that was expressed in seeds of wild type and alg3-2 plants. N-glycans on these antibodies from mutant seeds were predominantly of the intermediate Man(5)GlcNAc(2) compared to Man(8)GlcNAc(2) and Man(7)GlcNAc(2) isoforms on MBP10 from wild-type seeds. The presence of aberrant N-glycans on MBP10 did not seem to affect MBP10 dimerisation nor binding of MBP10 to its antigen. In alg3-2 the fraction of underglycosylated MBP10 protein forms was higher than in wild type. Interestingly, the expression of MBP10 resulted also in underglycosylation of other, endogenous glycoproteins.},

It is unknown, however, if all wheat varieties are equally harmful for patients. We investigated whether wheat varieties exist with a natural low number of T-cell-stimulatory epitopes. Gluten proteins present in public databases were analyzed for the presence of T-cell-stimulatory sequences. In addition, wheat accessions from diploid (AA, SS/BB, and DD genomes), tetraploid (AABB), and hexaploid (AABBDD) Triticum species were tested for the presence of T-cell-stimulatory epitopes in gliadins and glutenins by both T-cell and monoclonal antibody-based assays. The database analysis readily identified gluten proteins that lack 1 or more of the known T-cell-stimulatory sequences. Moreover, both the T-cell- and antibody-based assays showed that a large variation exists in the amount of T-cell-stimulatory peptides present in the wheat accessions. Sufficient genetic variation is present to endeavor the selection of wheat accessions that contain low amounts of T-cell-stimulatory sequences. Such materials may be used to select and breed wheat varieties suitable for consumption by CD patients, contributing to a well-balanced diet and an increase in their quality of life.

In our study it was applied to recombinant (r)Mal d 1, rBet v 1a and rBet v 1d, and natural (n)Mal d 1 from fruits of Malus domestica, cultivar Granny Smith. Q-TOF MSMS allowed sequencing of about 70% of all amino acids in Mal d 1 and about 60% of those in Bet v 1. Mixing experiments with rBet v 1 isoforms and with rMal d 1 and nMal d 1 revealed that the technique allows identification of isoforms in mixtures down to a level of at least 5%. Recombinant Mal d 1 was identified as a Mal d 1a representative, whereas Granny Smith apples were shown to contain Mal d 1b-like allergen isoforms. In this apple cultivar hitherto unreported modifications of Mal d 1b were identified. Q-TOF MSMS allowed semiquantitative measurement of allergen at the femtomole to picomole level.

Specific gluten peptides can be presented by antigen presenting cells to gluten-sensitive T-cell lymphocytes leading to CD. During the last decades, a significant increase has been observed in the prevalence of CD. This may partly be attributed to an increase in awareness and to improved diagnostic techniques, but increased wheat and gluten consumption is also considered a major cause. To analyze whether wheat breeding contributed to the increase of the prevalence of CD, we have compared the genetic diversity of gluten proteins for the presence of two CD epitopes (Glia-α9 and Glia-α20) in 36 modern European wheat varieties and in 50 landraces representing the wheat varieties grown up to around a century ago. Glia-α9 is a major (immunodominant) epitope that is recognized by the majority of CD patients. The minor Glia-α20 was included as a technical reference. Overall, the presence of the Glia-α9 epitope was higher in the modern varieties, whereas the presence of the Glia-α20 epitope was lower, as compared to the landraces. This suggests that modern wheat breeding practices may have led to an increased exposure to CD epitopes. On the other hand, some modern varieties and landraces have been identified that have relatively low contents of both epitopes. Such selected lines may serve as a start to breed wheat for the introduction of 'low CD toxic' as a new breeding trait. Large-scale culture and consumption of such varieties would considerably aid in decreasing the prevalence of CD.},

In vitro -grown apple plantlets were transformed with a construct coding for an intron-spliced hairpin RNA containing a Mal d 1-specific inverted repeat sequence separated by a Mal d 1-specific intron sequence. The presence of the construct in transformants was checked by PCR. Expression of Mal d 1 in leaves was monitored by prick-to-prick skin testing in 3 patients allergic to apples and by immunoblotting with a Mal d 1-reactive mAb and with IgE antibodies against Mal d 1.

With PCR, in 6 of 9 selected plantlets, the presence of the gene-silencing construct was demonstrated. By skin prick test it was shown that a wild-type plantlet had significantly ( P < .05) higher allergenicity than 5 of the transformants. Reduction of expression of Mal d 1 was confirmed by immunoblotting. In wild-type and unsuccessful transformants, a strong band was detected with Mal d 1-reactive mAb 5H8 at the expected apparent M r of 17 kDa.

  abstract = {Glycosyltransferases are involved in the biosynthesis of lipid-linked N-glycans. Here, we identify and characterize a mannosyltransferase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is the functional homolog of the ALG3 (Dol-P-Man:Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol alpha1,3-mannosyl transferase) gene in yeast. The At ALG3 protein can complement a Deltaalg3 yeast mutant and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in yeast and in plants. A homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant, alg3-2, was identified in Arabidopsis with residual levels of wild-type ALG3, derived from incidental splicing of the 11th intron carrying the T-DNAs. N-glycan analysis of alg3-2 and alg3-2 in the complex-glycan-less mutant background, which lacks N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase I activity, reveals that when ALG3 activity is strongly reduced, almost all N-glycans transferred to proteins are aberrant, indicating that the Arabidopsis oligosaccharide transferase complex is remarkably substrate tolerant. In alg3-2 plants, the aberrant glycans on glycoproteins are recognized by endogenous mannosidase I and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and efficiently processed into complex-type glycans. Although no high-mannose-type glycoproteins are detected in alg3-2 plants, these plants do not show a growth phenotype under normal growth conditions. However, the glycosylation abnormalities result in activation of marker genes diagnostic of the unfolded protein response.},

Here, we identified the alg3 gene of the mushroom-forming fungus Schizophyllum commune by homology search. Its function was confirmed by the complementation of the Δalg3 strain of S. cerevisiae. Inactivation of alg3 in S. commune resulted in the production of predominantly Man(3)GlcNAc(2) protein-linked N-glycans. No impact on growth nor a developmental phenotype due to the deletion was observed.

This study aimed to provide information on the morbidity and mortality of robot-assisted complex hiatal hernia repair and redo anti-reflux surgery in a high-volume center. All patients that underwent robot-assisted hiatal hernia repair, redo hiatal hernia repair, and anti-reflux surgery between 2011 and 2017 at the Meander Medical Centre, Amersfoort, the Netherlands were evaluated. Primary endpoints were 30-day morbidity and mortality. Major complications were defined as Clavien-Dindo ≥ IIIb. Primary surgery 211 primary surgeries were performed by two surgeons. The median age was 67 (IQR 58-73) years. 84.4% of patients had a type III or IV hernia (10.9% Type I; 1.4% Type II; 45.5% Type III; 38.9% Type IV, 1.4% no herniation). In 3.3% of procedures, conversion was required. 17.1% of patients experienced complications. The incidence of major complications was 5.2%. Ten patients (4.7%) were readmitted within 30 days. Symptomatic early recurrence occurred in two patients (0.9%). The 30-day mortality was 0.9%. Redo surgery 151 redo procedures were performed by two surgeons. The median age was 60 (IQR 51-68) years. In 2.0%, the procedure was converted. The overall incidence of complications was 10.6%, while the incidence of major complications was 2.6%. Three patients (2.0%) were readmitted within 30 days. One patient (0.7%) experienced symptomatic early recurrence. No patients died in the 30-day postoperative period. This study provides valuable information on robot-assisted laparoscopic repair of primary or recurrent hiatal hernia and anti-reflux surgery for both patient and surgeon. Serious morbidity of 5.2% in primary surgery and 2.6% in redo surgery, in this large series with a high surgeon caseload, has to be outweighed by the gain in quality of life or relief of serious medical implications of hiatal hernia when counseling for surgical intervention.},

We report here the long-term results of modified Belsey fundoplication (Gastroesophageal Valvuloplasty; GEV) performed laparoscopically using a surgical robot. Patients who underwent robotic GEV were reviewed retrospectively. Operations were performed by laparoscopy and included robotic dissection of the esophageal hiatus, primary closure of the hiatus, followed by intussusception of a 4 cm segment of the esophagus into the stomach for 270°, and suspension of the fundoplication on the hiatal closure. The results were assessed by postoperative endoscopy, contrast esophagography, a Subjective Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ), and objective Visick grading. There were 291 patients (156 male, 135 female, mean age 51±14 years). Indications were intractability (73%) and pulmonary symptoms (27%). Mean operative time was 130 minutes ± 52 minutes. Minor complications were seen in 21%. There was no mortality. Mean hospitalization was 2.8 days ± 1.7 days. Mean follow-up was 85 months ± 7 months. During this period, the mean SSQ score decreased from 8.3 ± 0.6 to 0.7± 0.2 (P < 0.05). There was no long-term dysphasia or gas bloat. Ninety-five percent of patients were Visick I and 5% were Visick II. Hiatal hernia recurred in 7 patients (2%). Robotic laparoscopic modified Belsey fundoplication (GEV) is associated with excellent long-term durability, reflux control, and low rates of dysphasia and gas bloat. This procedure may represent an alternative to medical antireflux therapy and other surgical antireflux procedures such as Nissen fundoplication.},

Preoperative anaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In general practice, little attention is paid to these anaemic patients. Some will have oral iron prescribed others not. The waiting period prior to elective colorectal surgery could be used to optimize a patients' physiological status. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of preoperative intravenous iron supplementation in comparison with the standard preoperative oral supplementation in anaemic patients with colorectal cancer. In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, patients with an M0-staged colorectal carcinoma who are scheduled for curative resection and with a proven iron deficiency anaemia are eligible for inclusion. Main exclusion criteria are palliative surgery, metastatic disease, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (5 × 5 Gy = no exclusion) and the use of Recombinant Human Erythropoietin within three months before inclusion or a blood transfusion within a month before inclusion. Primary endpoint is the percentage of patients that achieve normalisation of the haemoglobin level between the start of the treatment and the day of admission for surgery. This study is a superiority trial, hypothesizing a greater proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint in favour of iron infusion compared to oral supplementation. A total of 198 patients will be randomized to either ferric(III)carboxymaltose infusion in the intervention arm or ferrofumarate in the control arm. This study will be performed in ten centres nationwide and one centre in Ireland. This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of preoperative iron supplementation in exclusively anaemic patients with a colorectal carcinoma. Our trial hypotheses a more profound haemoglobin increase with intravenous iron which may contribute to a superior optimisation of the patient's condition and possibly a decrease in postoperative morbidity.

  abstract = {The neuroglial extracellular matrix (ECM) provides critical support and physiological cues for the proper growth, differentiation, and function of neuronal cells in the brain. However, in most in vitro settings that study neural physiology, cells are grown as monolayers on stiff surfaces that maximize adhesion and proliferation, and, therefore, they lack the physiological cues that ECM in native neuronal tissues provides. Macromolecular crowding (MMC) is a biophysical phenomenon based on the principle of excluded volume that can be harnessed to induce native ECM deposition by cells in culture. Here, we show that MMC using two species of Ficoll with vitamin C supplementation significantly boosts deposition of relevant brain ECM by cultured human astrocytes. Dopaminergic neurons cocultured on this astrocyte-ECM bed prepared under MMC treatment showed longer and denser neuronal extensions, a higher number of pre ad post synaptic contacts, and increased physiological activity, as evidenced by higher frequency calcium oscillation, compared to standard coculture conditions. When the pharmacological activity of various compounds was tested on MMC-treated cocultures, their responses were enhanced, and for apomorphine, a D2-receptor agonist, it was inverted in comparison to control cell culture conditions, thus emulating responses observed in in vivo settings. These results indicate that macromolecular crowding can harness the ECM-building potential of human astrocytes in vitro forming an ultra-flat 3D microenvironment that makes neural cultures more physiological and pharmacological relevant.},

We tested the hypothesis that ENaC within the cardiac sensory network are mandatory for mechanosensation. Experiments were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats, isolated nodose ganglion cells with cardiac afferents and isolated vagus nerves. Epicardial delivery of the amiloride analogue benzamil intended to specifically inhibit ENaC presumably located on cardiac sensory afferents indeed blunted the mechanosensitive (i. e., sympathoinhibition by intravenous volume loading [-32% and -42% in treated groups vs. -67% in controls; n = 7 each; p < 0.05]) as well as-though to a lesser extent-the 5-HT(3)-mediated chemosensitive cardiorenal reflex in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Using patch clamp technique, however, it turned out that neither amiloride nor benzamil influenced mechanically induced currents in ganglion nodosum cells in vitro, stimulated by hypoosmotic stress. The unspecific stretch activated ion channel blocker gadolinium completely abolished mechanically induced currents, indicating respective cells were mechanosensitive. In isolated vagus nerves benzamil impaired action potentials obtained by electrical stimulation (C-spike amplitude [-33%]; latency [+12%]; n = 8; p < 0.05). Our findings at least cast doubt on ENaC exclusively playing a specific role as mechanotransducers within the cardiac sensory network. Other ion channels might be involved. Furthermore the observed findings in vivo could also be due to unspecific disturbance of afferent signal conduction.},

To address this, three experimental animal models of renal injury (streptozotocin diabetes I, unilateral ureteral ligation (UUO), and 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx)) were studied in either Nox4-inducible (Nox4(*/*)) or constitutive knockout (Nox4(-/-)) mice. Nox4 contributed more than 80% of diphenylene iodonium-sensitive H(2)O(2) formation of freshly isolated tubules determined by Amplex Red assay. In streptozotocin diabetes, acute deletion of Nox4 by tamoxifen-activated cre-recombinase increased albuminuria, whereas matrix deposition was similar between WT and Nox4(*/*) mice. Interestingly, renal Nox4 expression, mainly localized to tubular cells, decreased in the course of diabetes and this was not associated with a compensatory upregulation of Nox1 or Nox2. In the UUO model, renal expression of ICAM1, connective tissue growth factor, and fibronectin were higher in kidneys of Nox4(*/*) than control mice. Also in this model, levels of Nox4 decreased in the course of the disease. In the 5/6Nx model, which was performed in SV129 and SV129-Nox4(-/-) mice, no difference in the development of hypertension and albuminuria was found between the strains. Collectively, the first in vivo data of the kidney do not support the view that Nox4 is a main driver of renal disease. It rather appears that under specific conditions Nox4 may even slightly limit injury and disease progression.},

The contribution of different forms of renovascular hypertension and the mechanisms contributing to autonomic dysfunction in hypertension are incompletely understood. Here, murine models of renovascular hypertension with preserved (2-kidneys-1 clip, 2K1C) and reduced (1-kidney-1 clip, 1K1C) kidney mass were studied with regard to autonomic nervous system regulation (sympathetic tone: power-spectral analysis of systolic blood pressure; parasympathetic tone: power-spectral analysis of heart rate) and baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate by spontaneous, concomitant changes of systolic blood pressure and pulse interval. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin system and the rho-kinase pathway were determined by application of inhibitors. C57BL6N mice (6 to 11) with reduced kidney mass (1K1C) or with preserved kidney mass (2K1C) developed a similar degree of hypertension. In comparison to control mice, both models presented with a significantly increased sympathetic tone and lower baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate. However, only 2K1C animals had a lower parasympathetic tone, whereas urinary norepinephrine excretion was reduced in the 1K1C model. Rho kinase inhibition given to a subset of 1K1C and 2K1C animals improved baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate selectively in the 1K1C model. Rho kinase inhibition had no additional effects on autonomic nervous system in either model of renovascular hypertension and did not change the blood pressure. Blockade of AT1 receptors (in 2K1C animals) normalized the sympathetic tone, decreased resting heart rate, improved baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate and parasympathetic tone. Regardless of residual renal mass, blood pressure and sympathetic tone are increased, whereas baroreflex sensitivity is depressed in murine models of renovascular hypertension. Reduced norepinephrine excretion and/or degradation might contribute to sympathoactivation in renovascular hypertension with reduced renal mass (1K1C). Overall, the study helps to direct research to optimize medical therapy of hypertension.},

Interstitial inflammation (OR, 16.59; 95% CI, 3.91-70.39) and renal calcification (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.03- 5.75) were associated with severe IVDU, whereas hypertensive and ischemic damage were associated with cocaine abuse (OR, 6.00; 95% CI, 1.27-28.44). Neither specific glomerular damage indicative for heroin and hepatitis C virus-related disease nor signs of analgesic nephropathy were found. White population, lack of a comparable control group, incomplete clinical data, and absence of routine immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Illicit drug abuse is associated with a broad but unspecific spectrum of pathologic alterations of the kidneys. Cocaine abuse has a deleterious role in this setting by promoting hypertensive and ischemic damage.},

  abstract = {Hyperlipidemia enhances xanthine oxidase (XO) activity. XO is an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since ROS are thought to promote atherosclerosis, we hypothesized that XO is involved in the development of atherosclerosis. ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a Western-type (WD) or control diet. In subgroups, tungsten (700 mg/L) was administered to inhibit XO. XO is a secreted enzyme which is formed in the liver as xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and binds to the vascular endothelium. High expression of XDH was found in the liver and WD increased liver XDH mRNA and XDH protein expression. WD induced the conversion of XDH to the radical-forming XO. Moreover, WD increased the hepatic expression of CD40, demonstrating activation of hepatic cells. Aortic tissue of ApoE(-/-) mice fed a WD for 6 months exhibited marked atherosclerosis, attenuated endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, increased vascular oxidative stress, and mRNA expression of the chemokine KC. Tungsten treatment had no effect on plasma lipids but lowered the plasma XO activity. In animals fed a control diet, tungsten had no effect on radical formation, endothelial function, or atherosclerosis development. In mice fed a WD, however tungsten attenuated the vascular superoxide anion formation, prevented endothelial dysfunction, and attenuated KC mRNA expression. Most importantly, tungsten treatment largely prevented the development of atherosclerosis in the aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice on WD. Therefore, tungsten, potentially via the inhibition of XO, prevents the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice on WD.},

The hope is that these CIVMs will mimic human physiology and pathology and predict clinical responses more accurately than the current cellular models. The integration of these CIVMs into the drug discovery and development pipeline requires rigorous scientific validation, including cellular, morphological, and functional characterization; benchmarking of clinical biomarkers; and operationalization as robust and reproducible screening platforms. It will be critical to establish the degree of physiological complexity that is needed in each CIVM to accurately reproduce native-like homeostasis and disease phenotypes, as well as clinical pharmacological responses. Choosing which CIVM to use at each stage of the drug discovery and development pipeline will be driven by a fit-for-purpose approach, based on the specific disease pathomechanism to model and screening throughput needed. Among the different CIVMs, biofabricated tissue equivalents are emerging as robust and versatile cellular assay platforms. Biofabrication technologies, including bioprinting approaches with hydrogels and biomaterials, have enabled the production of tissues with a range of physiological complexity and controlled spatial arrangements in multiwell plate platforms, which make them amenable for medium-throughput screening. However, operationalization of such 3D biofabricated models using existing automation screening platforms comes with a unique set of challenges. These challenges will be discussed in this perspective, including examples and thoughts coming from a laboratory dedicated to designing and developing assays for automated screening.},

We hypothesized that the metabolism of EETs by the sEH contributes to angiotensin II-induced hypertension and tested the effects of a water-soluble sEH inhibitor, 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido) dodecanoic acid (AUDA) on blood pressure. AUDA (130 microg/mL in drinking water) did not affect blood pressure in normotensive animals but markedly lowered it in mice with angiotensin II-induced hypertension (1 mg/kg per day). The effect of AUDA was accompanied by an increase in urinary salt and water excretion. Intravenous application of AUDA (8 mg/kg) acutely lowered blood pressure and heart rate in animals with angiotensin II-induced hypertension but failed to affect blood pressure in animals with phenylephrine-induced hypertension (29 mg/kg per day). AUDA (0.1 micromol/L) selectively lowered vascular resistance in an isolated perfused kidney preparation from angiotensin II-pretreated mice but not from control mice. In the perfused hind limb and in isolated carotid arteries from angiotensin II-treated mice, AUDA was without effect. The omega-hydroxylase inhibitor N-methylsulfonyl-12,12-dibromododec-11-enamide, which attenuates formation of the potent vasoconstrictor 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, decreased tone in carotid arteries from angiotensin II-treated but not from control mice. These data demonstrate that the decrease in blood pressure observed after sEH inhibition in angiotensin II-induced hypertension can be attributed to an initial reduction in heart rate followed by pressure diuresis resulting from increased perfusion of the kidney. Direct vasodilatation of resistance arteries in skeletal muscles does not appear to contribute to the antihypertensive effects of sEH inhibition in mice.},

The carrier demanded by the experimental setup also served as a control. The results showed that: (1) during phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC) the frequency and duration of contractions showed a significant decrease in the duodenum for WS(R) 1340; (2) WS(R) 1520 significantly reduced the contraction amplitudes in the duodenum during phase I and II of the MMC; (3) trends for decreased values were seen for WS(R) 1340 in the gastric corpus and duodenum and for WS(R) 1520 in the gastric antrum; (4) in the gastric corpus the duration of contractions was significantly reduced after application of WS(R) 1340 during phases I and II of the MMC; (5) WS(R) 1520 significantly reduced the contraction amplitudes and the duration of contractions in the gastric corpus during phase III of the MMC; (6) for the hydrophobic phase a moderate but significant decrease of duration of contractions in the duodenum and of frequency of contractions in the gastric corpus was seen. No adverse events were observed during the study. In conclusion, it could be shown that both WS(R) 1340 and WS(R) 1520 contribute to the efficacy of Enteroplant(R). They act locally in the stomach and duodenum to produce smooth-muscle relaxation. The effects of the active ingredients WS(R) 1340 and WS(R) 1520 substantially exceed the effects observed with the galenic auxiliary material and the carrier, respectively.},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis and therapy of Shigatoxin 2 (Stx2)-mediated kidney failure remain controversial. Our aim was to test whether, during an infection with Stx2-producing E. coli (STEC), Stx2 exerts direct effects on renal tubular epithelium and thereby possibly contributes to acute renal failure. Mice represent a suitable model because they, like humans, express the Stx2-receptor Gb3 in the tubular epithelium but, in contrast to humans, not in glomerular endothelia, and are thus free of glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). In wild-type mice, Stx2 caused acute tubular dysfunction with consequent electrolyte disturbance, which was most likely the cause of death. Tubule-specific depletion of Gb3 protected the mice from acute renal failure. In vitro, Stx2 induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis in human tubular epithelial cells, thus implicating a direct effect of Stx2 on the tubular epithelium. To correlate these results to human disease, kidney biopsies and outcome were analysed in patients with Stx2-associated kidney failure (n = 11, aged 22-44 years). The majority of kidney biopsies showed different stages of an ongoing TMA; however, no glomerular complement activation could be demonstrated. All biopsies, including those without TMA, showed severe acute tubular damage. Due to these findings, patients were treated with supportive therapy without complement-inhibiting antibodies (eculizumab) or immunoadsorption. Despite the severity of the initial disease [creatinine 6.34 (1.31-17.60) mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 1944 (753-2792) U/l, platelets 33 (19-124)/nl and haemoglobin 6.2 (5.2-7.8) g/dl; median (range)], all patients were discharged after 33 (range 19-43) days with no neurological symptoms and no dialysis requirement [creatinine 1.39 (range 0.84-2.86) mg/dl]. The creatinine decreased further to 0.90 (range 0.66-1.27) mg/dl after 24 months. Based on these data, one may surmise that acute tubular damage represents a separate pathophysiological mechanism, importantly contributing to Stx2-mediated acute kidney failure. Specifically in young adults, an excellent outcome can be achieved by supportive therapy only.},

The relevance of extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD) for the detoxification of vascular O2.- is unknown. We determined the involvement of ecSOD in the control of blood pressure and endothelium-dependent responses in angiotensin II-induced hypertension and renovascular hypertension induced by the two-kidney, one-clip model in wild-type mice and mice lacking the ecSOD gene. Blood pressure was identical in sham-operated ecSOD+/+ and ecSOD-/- mice. After 6 days of angiotensin II-treatment and 2 and 4 weeks after renal artery clipping, blood pressure was significantly higher in ecSOD-/- than ecSOD+/+ mice. Recombinant ecSOD selectively decreased blood pressure in hypertensive ecSOD-/- mice, whereas ecSOD had no effect in normotensive and hypertensive ecSOD+/+ mice. Compared with sham-operated ecSOD+/+ mice, sham-operated ecSOD-/- mice exhibited attenuated acetylcholine-induced relaxations. These responses were further depressed in vessels from clipped animals. Vascular O2.-, as measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence, was higher in ecSOD-/- compared with ecSOD+/+ mice and was increased by clipping. The antioxidant tiron normalized relaxations in vessels from sham-operated and clipped ecSOD-/-, as well as from clipped ecSOD+/+ mice. In contrast, in vivo application of ecSOD selectively enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation in vessels from ecSOD-/- mice. These data reveal that endogenous ecSOD is a major antagonistic principle to vascular O2.-, controlling blood pressure and vascular function in angiotensin II-dependent models of hypertension. ecSOD is expressed in such an abundance that even in situations of high oxidative stress no relative lack of enzyme activity occurs.},

The 1-kidney-1-clip model resulted in impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and hypertension and vascular oxidative stress in wild-type and ecSOD-/- mice. Recombinant ecSOD lowered the blood pressure and improved aortic nitric oxide bioavailability in wild-type and ecSOD-/- but not eNOS-/- mice. ecSOD had no effect on blood pressure in eNOS-/- or wild-type mice treated with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The 1-kidney-1-clip model markedly induced ecSOD protein expression, whereas activity was increased by only 25%, suggesting a partial inactivation of ecSOD in high-volume hypertension. Incubation of aortic segments with peroxynitrite or hydrogen peroxide attenuated ecSOD activity, but peroxynitrite did not induce tyrosine nitration of ecSOD, suggesting oxidative inactivation of the enzyme. Administration of polyethyleneglycol-catalase for 3 days selectively lowered the blood pressure in ecSOD+/+ but not ecSOD-/- mice and improved nitric oxide bioavailability. In contrast, acute application of catalase had no effect. Nitric oxide mediates the vascular effects of ecSOD.

Activation of Rho-GTPases has been linked to podocyte dysfunction, a feature of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). We investigated the effect of Rac-1 and Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibition on progressive renal failure in mice and studied the underlying mechanisms in podocytes. SV129 mice were subjected to 5/6-nephrectomy which resulted in arterial hypertension and albuminuria. Subgroups of animals were treated with the Rac-1 inhibitor EHT1846, the ROCK inhibitor SAR407899 and the ACE inhibitor Ramipril. Only Ramipril reduced hypertension. In contrast, all inhibitors markedly attenuated albumin excretion as well as glomerular and tubulo-interstitial damage. The combination of SAR407899 and Ramipril was more effective in preventing albuminuria than Ramipril alone. To study the involved mechanisms, podocytes were cultured from SV129 mice and exposed to static stretch in the Flexcell device. This activated RhoA and Rac-1 and led via TGFβ to apoptosis and a switch of the cells into a more mesenchymal phenotype, as evident from loss of WT-1 and nephrin and induction of α-SMA and fibronectin expression. Rac-1 and ROCK inhibition as well as blockade of TGFβ dramatically attenuated all these responses. This suggests that Rac-1 and RhoA are mediators of podocyte dysfunction in CKD. Inhibition of Rho-GTPases may be a novel approach for the treatment of CKD.},

Physiologically relevant tissue models of the lower respiratory tract (LRT), including the respiratory bronchioles and the alveolar sacs, are of high interest because they are the primary site of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and are most affected during the terminal stage of COVID-19. Current epithelial lung models used to study respiratory viral infections include lung epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI) with fibroblasts and endothelial cells, but such models do not have a perfusable microvascular network to investigate both viral infectivity and viral infection-induced thrombotic events. Using a high throughput, 64-chip microfluidic plate-based platform, we have developed two novel vascularized, LRT multi-chip models for the alveoli and the small airway. Both models include a perfusable microvascular network consisting of human primary microvascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pericytes. The established biofabrication protocols also enable the formation of differentiated lung epithelial layers at the ALI on top of the vascularized tissue bed. We validated the physiologically relevant cellular composition, architecture and perfusion of the vascularized lung tissue models using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and electrical resistance measurements. These vascularized, perfusable microfluidic lung tissue on high throughput assay platforms will enable the development of respiratory viral infection and disease models for research investigation and drug discovery.},

  abstract = {We investigated the cardioprotective effect of acute and chronic sodium hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE-1) inhibition with cariporide under pathological conditions in rabbits fed an atherogenic diet (0.25% cholesterol, 3% coconut oil), an experimental model of atherosclerosis. New Zealand White rabbits were fed over 4 weeks with normal diet or with atherogenic diet and randomized in 3 subgroups (n=7 in each group); placebo, acute cariporide (0.3 mg/kg, 10 min. before occlusion of left anterior descending coronary artery and chronic cariporide (4 weeks 0.1% in chow). In the final infarction experiments the animals were subjected to 30 min. of myocardial ischaemia by occlusion of a branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 2 hr of reperfusion. Infarct mass was evaluated by triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride staining and the infarct size expressed as a percentage of area at risk. Besides the assessment of aortic endothelium-dependent function aortic and cardiac vessels were inspected for atherosclerotic lesions. In cholesterol-fed rabbits, the infarct size was significantly increased when compared with normal diet animals (63+/-3% versus 41+/-3%). Acute cariporide treatment reduced the infarct size in normal diet rabbits to 14%+/-3% (66% decrease, P<0.05) as well as in atherogenic diet rabbits to 22+/-3% (65% decrease, P<0.05). Chronic treatment with cariporide also reduced the infarct size significantly: normal diet 19+/-2% (53% decrease, P<0.05), atherogenic diet 32+/-3% (49% decrease, P<0.05). Total cholesterol serum levels in rabbits with atherogenic diet were significantly higher (15.3+/-2.7 mmol/l) than those on a standard diet (0.65+/-0.08 mmol/l). Chronic cariporide treatment significantly attenuated the increase of serum cholesterol (7.9+/-1.9 mmol/l) and improved the lipoprotein pattern. Although the aortas and heart vessels of hypercholesterolaemic animals were without any histological evidence of atherosclerosis they developed endothelial dysfunction (reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation by ACh), which was prevented by chronic cariporide treatment. Acute and chronic treatment with the NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide significantly reduced infarct mass. This effect was associated with improved endothelial function.},

EETs are degraded by the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and sEH inhibitors are considered treatment for chronic renal failure (CRF). We determined whether sEH inhibition attenuates the progression of CRF in the 5/6-nephrectomy model (5/6-Nx) in mice. 5/6-Nx mice were treated with a placebo, an ACE-inhibitor (Ramipril, 40 mg/kg), the sEH-inhibitor cAUCB or the CYP-inhibitor fenbendazole for 8 weeks. 5/6-Nx induced hypertension, albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulo-interstitial damage and these effects were attenuated by Ramipril. In contrast, cAUCB failed to lower the blood pressure and albuminuria was more severe as compared to placebo. Plasma EET-levels were doubled in 5/6 Nx-mice as compared to sham mice receiving placebo. Renal sEH expression was attenuated in 5/6-Nx mice but cAUCB in these animals still further increased the EET-level. cAUCB also increased 5-HETE and 15-HETE, which derive from peroxidation or lipoxygenases. Similar to cAUCB, CYP450 inhibition increased HETEs and promoted albuminuria. Thus, sEH-inhibition failed to elicit protective effects in the 5/6-Nx model and showed a tendency to aggravate the disease. These effects might be consequence of a shift of arachidonic acid metabolism into the lipoxygenase pathway.},

Influenza A/H1N1 antibody titers (AB) were determined before and 21 days after vaccination by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Immune response was not different between HIV-infected patients (n = 36) and healthy controls (n = 42) who were previously naïve to the H1N1v component of the TIV. Comparing HIV-infected patients (n = 55) and healthy controls (n = 63) who had received 1 or 2 doses of an AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine in the previous winter season (2009/10), seroconversion rate and the geometric mean AB titer after TIV of the HIV-infected patients were more than twice as high compared to healthy controls. This difference was mainly driven by the 2-dose schedule for HIV patients in 2009/10. Vitamin D levels were lower in HIV patients but did not correlate with immune response. HIV-infected patients who had received 1 or 2 doses of an adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine in the previous year (2009/10) had a significant higher seroconversion rate following TIV as compared to healthy controls, indicating a stronger memory cell response due to the 2-dose schedule.},

Data on prevalence and consequences of hypertension are limited, but recent studies suggest that HIV-infected individuals are at a higher risk of developing hypertension. In this prospective study, HIV-1-infected patients from the Frankfurt AIDS Cohort Study (FACS) were followed for 1 year to determine the frequency of systemic hypertension and to assess the associated clinical and demographic factors. A total 214 HIV-1-infected patients, predominantly Caucasian males, participated in the study. Prevalence of systemic hypertension was 29%. The groups of hypertensive and normotensive individuals were comparable in terms of ethnic background and duration of infection. As in the general population, hypertensive subjects were older (49.1+/-11.1 vs 39.0+/-8.1 years; P<0.0001) and waist-to-hip ratio was higher than in normotensive individuals (0.99+/-0.07 vs 0.93+/-0.08; P<0.0001). Hypertension was associated with a much higher frequency of persistent proteinuria (41.1% vs 2.8%; P<0.001), coronary heart disease (16.1% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001) and myocardial infarction (8.1% vs 0.7%; P<0.005), whereas most cardiovascular risk factors were similar in both groups. Our data do not demonstrate any association between the presence of hypertension and antiretroviral therapy or immune status. However, hypertension seems to have a high impact on the existing risk for premature cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, overt proteinuria is frequent in HIV-1 infection with hypertension and might be due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis as well as yet undefined renal disease in these patients.},

We detected tissue-specific chemokine and cytokine storms in response to viral infection, including well-defined biomarkers in severe SARS-CoV-2 and IAV infections such as CXCL10, IL-6, and IL-10. Our single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed similar findings to that found in vivo for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including dampened IFN response, increased chemokine induction, and inhibition of MHC Class I presentation not observed for IAV infected tissues. Finally, we demonstrate the pharmacological validity of these ALI tissue models as antiviral drug screening assay platforms, with the potential to be easily adapted to include other cell types and increase the throughput to test relevant pathogens.},

Description of the modified technical setup and retrospective analysis of the feasibility of the RCA-protocol for TPE in all patients treated between 2009 and 2010. 411 consecutive TPE with RCA were performed in 42 patients, all using FFP as replacement fluid. Median procedure characteristics were: blood flow 160 ml/min, filtrate flow 36 ml/min, duration 93 min, processed total plasma volume 3600 mL. Trisodium citrate was infused at a rate of 0.43 mmol/min to achieve post-filter ionized calcium levels of <0.4 mmol/l. Calcium substitution rate was 0.19 mmol/min to maintain physiologic iCa levels. RCA was well tolerated with no significant differences in pH, iCa, bicarbonate or potassium after repeated sessions. Clotting events complicated 7.3% of the procedures. Adverse events occurred in 3.4% of TPE procedures; none was severe or fatal. No significant differences were observed comparing the rate of adverse events to those observed in TPE using standard anticoagulation at our center (4.8%). We describe for the first time a modified protocol for RCA in TPE using an integrated citrate module. Based on our experience, this RCA protocol is a feasible alternative for anticoagulation in TPE with FFP, especially in patients with a high risk of bleeding.},

  abstract = {Occupational stress is associated with detrimental consequences that are addressed by mobile health (mHealth) solutions. Previous developments of apps for occupational stress have not yet fully exploited the potential of multilevel diagnostics through the integration of wearable sensors for interventions. Personalizing mHealth approaches in terms of intervention time and content, which requires the use of artificial intelligence, is the next logical developmental step. The "Relax" approach developed a corresponding prototype of an app-wearable system, which will be evaluated for effectiveness in terms of stress reduction and usability. This study protocol describes an evaluation study used to test the effectiveness and usability of the Relax approach. The evaluation study was designed as a 2-arm randomized trial with 2 phases, each with a 3-week intervention period. In both phases, employees were required to use the app to record daily stress and to wear a wearable sensor to measure heart rate variability. The app offered interventions based on algorithms, which altered the probability of their selection after learning from the data, thereby personalizing the user experience. In the second phase of the study, the sample was divided into 2 groups, varying the degree of personalization of the app. To analyze effectiveness, a 2-factorial mixed within-between design will be applied to compare the outcomes between both groups as well as in a pre-post comparison. In addition, exploratory analyses of the usability of the approach are planned. The study was conducted during the spring and summer of 2024, with a total of 46 participants enrolled, and is ready for data analysis. The Relax approach, including a number of factors related to personalization that have not yet been incorporated into mHealth in current research, will provide new insights into the next steps of advanced mHealth solutions. Limitations of the study design, such as the lack of a control group and the sample representativity, have to be addressed. Open Science Foundation 10.17605/OSF.IO/MYRD9; https://osf.io/myrd9.

The construction of the microswimmer has the following features: (i) it is a bilayer ribbon with a length of 80 or 120 [Formula: see text]m, consisting of a thermo-responsive hydrogel of poly-N-isopropylamide coated with a 2-nm layer of gold and equipped with homogeneously dispersed gold nanorods; (ii) the width of the ribbon is linearly tapered with a wider end of 5 [Formula: see text]m and a tip of 0.5 [Formula: see text]m; (iii) a thickness of only 1 and 2 [Formula: see text]m that ensures a maximum variation of the cross section of the ribbon along its length from square to rectangular. These wedge-shaped ribbons form conical helices when the hydrogel is swollen in cold water and extend to a filament-like object when the temperature is raised above the volume phase transition of the hydrogel at [Formula: see text]. The two ends of these ribbons undergo different but coupled modes of motion upon fast temperature cycling through plasmonic heating of the gel-objects from inside. Proper choice of the IR-light pulse sequence caused the ribbons to move at a rate of 6 body length/s (500 [Formula: see text]m/s) with the wider end ahead. Within the confinement of rectangular container of 30 [Formula: see text]m height and 300 [Formula: see text]m width, the different modes can be actuated in a way that the movement is directed by the energy input between spinning on the spot and fast forward locomotion.},

The transition from first generation to second generation UCAs was marked by an advancement in stability as air was replaced by a hydrophobic gas, such as perfluoropropane and sulfur hexafluoride. Further improvement can be realized by focusing on how well the UCAs shell can retain the encapsulated gas under extreme mechanical deformations. Here we report the next generation of UCAs for which we engineered the shell structure to impart much better stability under repeated prolonged oscillation due to ultrasound, and large changes in shear and turbulence as it circulates within the body. By adapting an architecture with two layers of contrasting elastic properties similar to bacterial cell envelopes, our ultrastable nanobubbles (NBs) withstand continuous in vitro exposure to ultrasound with minimal signal decay and have a significant delay on the onset of in vivo signal decay in kidney, liver, and tumor. Development of ultrastable NBs can potentially expand the role of ultrasound in molecular imaging, theranostics, and drug delivery.},

ChIP-seq for activating histone marks and Pol II loading identified candidate enhancer elements controlling the ACE2 locus, including the intronic dACE2 promoter. Employing RNA-seq, we demonstrate that interferons activate expression of dACE2 and, to a lesser extent, the genuine ACE2 gene. Interferon-induced gene expression was mitigated by the JAK inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib, used therapeutically in COVID-19 patients. Through integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data we provide an in-depth understanding of genetic programs activated by interferons, and our study highlights JAK inhibitors as suitable tools to suppress these in bronchial cells.},

We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data and renal biopsies obtained from patients with severe renal impairment (overt proteinuria, progressive deterioration of renal function) after LT with respect to safety, etiology of renal disease, and therapeutic consequences. Renal biopsies were obtained from 14 patients at median (minimum-maximum) 3 (0.2-12) years after LT. No major complications associated with renal biopsy were observed.

The diagnosis of specific renal diseases other than calcineurin-inhibitor nephrotoxicity facilitated specific treaments and avoided unnecessary modification of immunosuppression in the majority of patients. Renal biopsy in patients with CKD after LT seems safe and may offer specific therapeutic options.

There is a need for robust sedation level monitoring systems to accurately track sedation levels across all drug classes, sex and age groups. Forty-four quantitative features estimated from a pooled dataset of 204 EEG recordings from 66 healthy adult volunteers who received either propofol, dexmedetomidine, or sevoflurane (all with and without remifentanil) were used in a machine learning based automated system to estimate the depth of sedation. Model training and evaluation were performed using leave-one-out cross validation methodology. We trained four machine learning models to predict sedation levels and evaluated the influence of remifentanil, age, and sex on the prediction performance. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the prediction model. The ensemble tree with bagging outperformed other machine learning models and predicted sedation levels with an AUC = 0.88 (0.81-0.90). There were significant differences in the prediction probability of the automated systems when trained and tested across different age groups and sex. The performance of the EEG based sedation level prediction system is drug, sex, and age specific. Nonlinear machine-learning models using quantitative EEG features can accurately predict sedation levels. The results obtained in this study may provide a useful reference for developing next generation EEG based sedation level prediction systems using advanced machine learning algorithms.

Haemodynamic and respiratory effects included mild dose-dependent tachycardia, slightly elevated blood pressure, and no centrally mediated apnoea. Upon stimulation with ACTH, no adrenocortical depression was observed in any subject. Involuntary muscle movements (IMM) were reported, which were more extensive with higher dosing regimens. Higher dosages of ABP-700 were associated with deeper sedation and increased likelihood of sedation. Time to onset of clinical effect was variable throughout the cohorts and recovery was swift. Infusions of ABP-700 showed a dose-dependent hypnotic effect, and did not cause severe hypotension, severe respiratory depression, or adrenocortical suppression.

A temporal spatial analysis of Utstein data was performed for all adult patients with a non-traumatic OHCA attended by three emergency medical services (EMS) covering the north of the Netherlands during a one-year period. Patients were considered potentially eligible for ECPR if they had a witnessed arrest with immediate bystander CPR, an initial shockable rhythm (or signs of life during resuscitation) and could be presented in an ECPR-centre within 45 minutes of the arrest. Endpoint of interest was defined as the hypothetical number of ECPR eligible patients after 10, 15 and 20 minutes of conventional CPR and upon (hypothetical) arrival in an ECPR-centre as a fraction of the total number of OHCA patients attended by EMS. During the study period 622 OHCA patients were attended, of which 200 (32%) met ECPR eligibility criteria upon EMS arrival. The optimal transition point between conventional CPR and ECPR was found to be after 15 minutes. Hypothetical intra-arrest transport of all patients in whom no return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained after that point (n = 84) would have yielded 16/622 (2.5%) patients being potentially ECPR eligible upon hospital arrival (average low-flow time 52 minutes), whereas on-scene initiation of ECPR would have resulted in 84/622 (13.5%) potential candidates (average estimated low-flow time 24 minutes before cannulation). Even in healthcare systems with relatively short transport distances to hospital, consideration should be given to pre-hospital initiation of ECPR for OHCA as it shortens low-flow time and increases the number of potentially eligible patients.},

Thirty-six patients undergoing short lasting sedation following cardiac surgery were included to receive propofol to maintain a BIS between 40 and 60. Robustness of control for all groups was analysed using prediction error and spectrographic analysis. Although similar time courses of measured BIS were obtained in all groups, a higher median propofol effect-site concentration (CePROP) was required in the HUMAN group compared to the BAYES and EPSAC groups. The time course analysis of the remifentanil effect-site concentration (CeREMI) revealed a significant increase in CeREMI in the EPSAC group compared to BAYES and HUMAN during the case. Although similar bias and divergence in control was found in all groups, larger control inaccuracy was observed in HUMAN versus EPSAC and BAYES. Spectrographic analysis of the system behavior shows that BAYES covers the largest spectrum of frequencies, followed by EPSAC and HUMAN. Both computer-based control systems are feasible to be used during ICU sedation with overall tighter control than HUMAN and even with lower required CePROP. EPSAC control required higher CeREMI than BAYES or HUMAN to maintain stable control. Clinical trial number: NCT00735631.},

Phantom pain can also occur in other parts of the body; it has been described after mastectomies and enucleation of the eye. Most patients with phantom pain have intermittent pain, with intervals that range from 1 day to several weeks. Even intervals of over a year have been reported. The pain often presents itself in the form of attacks that vary in duration from a few seconds to minutes or hours. In most cases, the pain is experienced distally in the missing limb, in places with the most extensive innervation density and cortical representation.

Conservative therapy consists of drug treatment with amitriptyline, tramadol, carbamazepine, ketamine, or morphine. Based on the available evidence some effect may be expected from drug treatment. When conservative treatment fails, pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the stump neuroma or of the spinal ganglion (DRG) or spinal cord stimulation could be considered (evidence score 0).

New materials to be integrated with the Si platform must conform to stringent purity standards. Here, we investigate graphene layers grown on copper foils by chemical vapor deposition and transferred to silicon wafers by wet etching and electrochemical delamination methods with respect to residual submonolayer metallic contaminations. Regardless of the transfer method and associated cleaning scheme, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and total reflection X-ray fluorescence measurements indicate that the graphene sheets are contaminated with residual metals (copper, iron) with a concentration exceeding 10(13) atoms/cm(2). These metal impurities appear to be partially mobile upon thermal treatment, as shown by depth profiling and reduction of the minority charge carrier diffusion length in the silicon substrate. As residual metallic impurities can significantly alter electronic and electrochemical properties of graphene and can severely impede the process of integration with silicon microelectronics, these results reveal that further progress in synthesis, handling, and cleaning of graphene is required to advance electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

There is scant evidence for the use of paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and neuropathic pain medications such as gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants for the treatment of radicular pain. Acute and subacute cervical radicular pain may respond well to epidural corticosteroid administration, preferentially using an interlaminar approach. By contrast, for chronic cervical radicular pain, the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid administration is limited. In these patients, pulsed radiofrequency treatment adjacent to the dorsal root ganglion may be considered. There is currently no gold standard for the diagnosis of cervical radicular pain. There is scant evidence for the use of medication. Epidural corticosteroid injection and pulsed radiofrequency adjacent to the dorsal root ganglion may be considered.

It is not clear if these findings apply to humans, and retrospective epidemiological studies thus far have failed to show definitive evidence that anesthetic agents are harmful to the developing human brain. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the preclinical studies published over the past decade, with a focus on methodological issues, to facilitate the comparison between different preclinical studies and inform better design of future trials. The literature search identified 941 articles related to the topic of neurotoxicity. As the primary aim of this systematic review was to compare methodologies applied in animal studies to inform future trials, we excluded a priori all articles focused on putative mechanism of neurotoxicity and the neuroprotective agents. Forty-seven preclinical studies were finally included in this review. Methods used in these studies were highly heterogeneous-animals were exposed to anesthetic agents at different developmental stages, in various doses and in various combinations with other drugs, and overall showed diverse toxicity profiles. Physiological monitoring and maintenance of physiological homeostasis was variable and the use of cognitive tests was generally limited to assessment of specific brain areas, with restricted translational relevance to humans. Comparison between studies is thus complicated by this heterogeneous methodology and the relevance of the combined body of literature to humans remains uncertain. Future preclinical studies should use better standardized methodologies to facilitate transferability of findings from preclinical into clinical science.},

Participants filled out a questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and medical history, had anthropometric measurements and provided blood samples for assessment of serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol. The correlation between RRSO and cholesterol profile was assessed with logistic regression. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were performed to explore a possible effect of age at and time since RRSO. At a median time of 5.9 years (range 2.3-25.2) after surgery, RRSO was associated with low (< 60 mg/dl) HDL-cholesterol (OR 9.74, 95% CI 5.19-18.26) and high (≥ 160 mg/dl) non-HDL-cholesterol (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.21-2.82) when adjusting for body mass index, hormone therapy, participation on sports and previous chemotherapy. The observed association was not dependent on age or time since RRSO. The RRSO group had less smokers (19.3 vs. 25.8%) and more participation on sports (45.4 vs. 22.0%). Our results suggest that RRSO is associated with a more atherogenic cholesterol profile, despite a lower prevalence of smoking and higher prevalence of participation on sports as compared to controls. This observation can be useful for physicians involved in the counselling and follow-up of women having RRSO.},

A search in Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus was performed to identify studies that used the USFD and were published between 01-10-2003 and 22-03-2015. We also searched in Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus for all publications that cited the two publications containing the original ILCOR advisory statement introducing and recommending the USFD. In total we identified 14 publications by groups that explicitly used elements of the USFD for collecting and reporting their data. Of the 22 core and 19 supplemental USFD parameters, 6-19 core (27-86%) and 1-12 (5-63%) supplemental parameters were used; two parameters (5%) have not been used in any publication. Associations with outcome were reported for nine core (41%) and five supplemental (26%) USFD parameters. The USFD publications also identified non-USFD parameters related to outcome: initial cardiac rhythm, time points and intervals during resuscitation, intubation at the drowning scene, first hospital core temperature, serum glucose and potassium, the use of inotropic/vasoactive agents and the Paediatric Index of Mortality 2-score. Fourteen USFD based drowning publications have been identified. These publications provide valuable information about the process and quality of drowning resuscitation and confirm that the USFD is helpful for a structured comparison of the outcome of drowning resuscitation.},

Sixty morbidly obese adult patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of either 0.3 mcg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D) or 3 mg/h Morphine (Group M) for 24 h immediately post-operatively. All patients received standardized general anesthesia and were evaluated and treated for pain in the intensive care unit by providers who were blinded to their treatment group. The primary outcome was the need for supplemental, "rescue" paracetamol (Dolargan. Hikma, Jordan) and morphine titrated to achieve visual analog scales (VAS) of <40 and <70, respectively. A total of 60 patients (77 % female, mean age 33.5 years ± 9.5 and body mass index (BMI) 43.0 ± 4.5) were randomized to Group M and 30 to Group D. There were no significant differences in mean rescue paracetamol and morphine requirements. Mean total morphine requirements in Group D were 6.1 ± 3.1 mg, whereas 72.9 ± 2.2 mg in Group M (p < 0.0001). An intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine, initiated and continued for 24 h following laparoscopic bariatric surgery, can decrease the overall morphine requirements during this period. This pilot study demonstrated that the post-operative initiation of dexmedetomidine can be morphine sparing following laparoscopic bariatric surgery.},

There is mixed evidence from cohort studies that young children exposed to anaesthesia can have an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. We aimed to establish whether general anaesthesia in infancy has any effect on neurodevelopmental outcome. Here we report the secondary outcome of neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age in the General Anaesthesia compared to Spinal anaesthesia (GAS) trial. In this international assessor-masked randomised controlled equivalence trial, we recruited infants younger than 60 weeks postmenstrual age, born at greater than 26 weeks' gestation, and who had inguinal herniorrhaphy, from 28 hospitals in Australia, Italy, the USA, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either awake-regional anaesthesia or sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia. Web-based randomisation was done in blocks of two or four and stratified by site and gestational age at birth. Infants were excluded if they had existing risk factors for neurological injury. The primary outcome of the trial will be the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient score at age 5 years. The secondary outcome, reported here, is the composite cognitive score of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III, assessed at 2 years. The analysis was as per protocol adjusted for gestational age at birth. A difference in means of five points (1/3 SD) was predefined as the clinical equivalence margin. This trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516 and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00756600. Between Feb 9, 2007, and Jan 31, 2013, 363 infants were randomly assigned to receive awake-regional anaesthesia and 359 to general anaesthesia. Outcome data were available for 238 children in the awake-regional group and 294 in the general anaesthesia group. In the as-per-protocol analysis, the cognitive composite score (mean [SD]) was 98.6 (14.2) in the awake-regional group and 98.2 (14.7) in the general anaesthesia group. There was equivalence in mean between groups (awake-regional minus general anaesthesia 0.169, 95% CI -2.30 to 2.64). The median duration of anaesthesia in the general anaesthesia group was 54 min. For this secondary outcome, we found no evidence that just less than 1 h of sevoflurane anaesthesia in infancy increases the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age compared with awake-regional anaesthesia.

One of these processes is associated with the phenomenon of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Anaesthetic conditioning is a widely described strategy to attenuate ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We therefore conducted the Volatile Anaesthetic Protection of Renal Transplants-1 trial, a pilot project evaluating the influence of two anaesthetic regimens, propofol- vs sevoflurane-based anaesthesia, on biochemical and clinical outcomes in living donor kidney transplantation. Sixty couples were randomly assigned to the following three groups: PROP (donor and recipient propofol), SEVO (donor and recipient sevoflurane), and PROSE (donor propofol and recipient sevoflurane). The primary outcome was renal injury reflected by urinary biomarkers. The follow-up period was 2 yr. Three couples were excluded, leaving 57 couples for analysis. Concentrations of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), N -acetyl-β- d -glucosaminidase (NAG), and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) in the first urine upon reperfusion showed no differences. On day 2, KIM-1 concentrations were higher in SEVO [952.8 (interquartile range 311.8-1893.0) pg mmol -1 ] compared with PROP [301.2 (202.0-504.7) pg mmol -1 ]. This was the same for NAG: SEVO, 1.835 (1.162-2.457) IU mmol -1 vs PROP, 1.078 (0.819-1.713) IU mmol -1 . Concentrations of H-FABP showed no differences. Measured glomerular filtration rate at 3, 6, and 12 months showed no difference. After 2 yr, there was a difference in the acute rejection rate ( P =0.039). Post hoc testing revealed a difference between PROP (35%) and PROSE (5%; P =0.020). The difference between PROP and SEVO (11%) was not significant ( P =0.110). The SEVO group showed higher urinary KIM-1 and NAG concentrations in living donor kidney transplantation on the second day after transplantation. This was not reflected in inferior graft outcome.

Experimental and clinical studies have shown protection by remote ischemic conditioning (RIC). We hypothesized that recipient RIC before kidney graft reperfusion reduces the time to graft recovery. This multicenter, blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial included 225 adult recipients of renal transplants from deceased donors at four transplantation centers in Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Participants were randomized 1:1 to RIC or sham-RIC. RIC consisted of 4 × 5-min thigh occlusion by an inflatable tourniquet each followed by 5-min deflation, performed during surgery prior to graft reperfusion. The tourniquet remained deflated for sham-RIC. The primary endpoint was the estimated time to a 50% decrease in baseline plasma creatinine (tCr50) calculated from plasma creatinine measurements 30 days posttransplant or 30 days after the last, posttransplant dialysis. No significant differences were observed between RIC and sham-RIC-treated patients in the primary outcome median tCr50 (122 h [95% confidence interval [CI] 98-151] vs. 112 h [95% CI 91-139], p = 0.58), or the number of patients receiving dialysis in the first posttransplant week (33% vs. 35%, p = 0.71).

At a median of 19 (i.q.r. 10-33) months after donation, 82 donors (24·6 per cent) had a CCS score above 0, of which 58 (71 per cent) had a CCS score of at least 2 and 57 (70 per cent) reported movement limitations. Some 110 donors (33·0 per cent) had a VAS score of more than 0. Complaints mainly occurred during bending over (12·3 per cent) and exercising (12·4 per cent). Thirty-two donors (9·7 per cent) required analgesics during follow-up between donation and the time of measurement, and six of 82 (7 per cent) reported chronic inguinal pain.

  abstract = {Despite alternative graft preservation techniques, static cold storage (SCS) remains the most widely used kidney preservation method. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of SCS' drawbacks remain poorly understood. One of the mechanisms that drives delayed graft function (DGF) and poorer transplant outcomes is suggested to entail increased oxidative stress due to prolonged cold ischemia, thus driving lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis via iron-mediated Fenton chemistry. Here, we investigate whether iron chelation with deferasirox can prevent the Fenton reaction and thereby mitigate lipid peroxidation and improve kidney preservation. Porcine kidneys underwent 24 h of SCS in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution with or without deferasirox (60 µmol), followed by 3 h of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Deferasirox-treated kidneys exhibited significantly lower lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by reduced 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4HNE)-protein adduct levels, without altering antioxidative capacity manifested by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) expression. Metabolic stability was enhanced, with increased glucose availability and a higher glucose-to-lactate ratio, suggesting improved oxidative phosphorylation. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels remained stable, indicating no adverse mitochondrial effects. Additionally, deferasirox reduced kidney weight gain, which may reflect lower edema formation, and strongly improved glomerular integrity and reduced tubular dilation. By reducing lipid peroxidation and maintaining metabolic function, deferasirox may help mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), enhance early graft function, and improve transplant outcomes. These findings strengthen the role of iron in cold-induced oxidative damage, and imply that iron chelation is a promising adjunct to improve graft preservation.},

The European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) is aware of the importance of taking good care of the brain, both of patients and of anaesthesia and intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, and has organised a complete learning track on brain health to bring this concern to the attention of practitioners. This learning track included an online Focus Meeting on Brain Health (November 25, 2023). We here provide readers with a digest of the information that was delivered during that meeting in an opinion paper driven by the authors' own reading of the literature. It is divided according to the meeting's sessions, including how to improve the health of an injured brain, how to keep a young or old brain healthy, how to keep a healthy adult brain unimpaired, how monitoring can impact brain health in the operating room and in the intensive care unit, and how to keep the anaesthesia and ICU caregivers' brain healthy. Each part is a brief and focused summary. The main delivered messages are that the management of injured brain patients involves an adequate choice of sedation, adequate brain monitoring, and focused attention to specific points depending on the underlying pathology; that several measures can be undertaken to protect the brain of the very young needing anaesthesia; that it is possible to detect older patients at risk of postoperative neurocognitive disorders, and that dedicated perioperative management by a multidisciplinary expert team may improve their outcomes; that apparently healthy adult brains may suffer during anaesthesia; that the electroencephalogram may track peri-operative brain dysfunction, and that female patients should be given special care in this respect; that multimodal brain monitoring helps to detect pathological processes and to maintain brain homeostasis; and that burnout in anaesthesiologists can be effectively fought using personal, organisational, managerial and legal approaches.},

  abstract = {To assess for feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of an ethnoracially-matched family navigation intervention aimed at reducing barriers to developmental evaluations for preschoolers with developmental concern attending Head Start. Fifty-eight parents of Head Start preschoolers who were identified as at risk for developmental delay were assigned using stratified block random sampling to the family navigation intervention (n = 28) and 30 controls (usual care). Key outcomes included the percentage of children who completed the planned intervention visits, satisfaction with the intervention, and the proportion of children guided by family navigators who completed developmental evaluations. Of the 28 families, 21 parents completed the family navigation intervention visits. The intervention sample was diverse, including 57% Black, 24% White, and 19% Latino(a) parents. Ninety percent of Head Start educators (n = 18) and 100% of healthcare providers (n = 6) were satisfied with the intervention. Parents qualitatively reported that they valued the advocacy support from the family navigators and navigators (n = 7) valued their role in "giving back." Sixty-six percent of the intervention group were seen by a healthcare provider to discuss developmental concerns showing preliminary effectiveness for completion of healthcare evaluations. However, there was no significant difference between those in the intervention and control group completing Head Start recommended evaluations, and over half of all participants were not referred for educational evaluations. Results support the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of an ethnoracially matched family navigation intervention to reduce barriers to developmental healthcare evaluations for preschoolers at risk for developmental delays.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to discover the care meanings of facilitators and barriers to detection and intervention for developmental delay among Head Start preschool-aged children, as viewed by parents, teachers, and primary care providers. We used a qualitative focus group design and broad cultural lens to understand similarities and differences in family and professional care, as Head Start programs educate preschoolers living in poverty who are disproportionately from ethno-racial minoritized groups. We sought the perspectives of 15 Head Start parents equally representing Black, Latino(a), and White parents, 17 teachers, and 11 healthcare providers to discover facilitators and barriers to adherence with professional recommendations. We found that silos in professional communications, parent distrust, knowledge deficits, and stigma were barriers to obtaining developmental recommendations. Participants also identified missed opportunities to facilitate interagency coordination, parental advocacy of a child's developmental needs, and professional alliances to take collaborative actions for early identification and treatment. Furthermore, a subculture of poverty adversely influenced adherence to developmental recommendations, and ethno-racial biases affected Black and Latino(a) families' follow-through. Our findings highlight how the lack of coordination between sectors resulted in the dismissal of parental concerns or denial of services by 1 system or the other, thus, at the very least reducing the child's chances for earlier intervention and treatment. We also identified potential benefits to children when the barriers of poverty and ethnoracial bias are addressed by professionals with coordinated actions, and new systems are developed for sharing developmental screening results and partnering to coordinate care across the preschool and primary healthcare settings.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews evidenced-based interventions for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) across the disciplines of psychology, speech-language pathology, occupational therapy, and developmental pediatrics. rates of ASD diagnoses have been steadily rising over the past 2 decades. There are a wide range of therapies and interventions, of varying levels of evidence, across disciplines that are now available to treat children with ASD. The field has moved toward a greater emphasis on the identification and utilization of evidenced-based treatments. a review and summary of recent literature was conducted by professionals in an interdisciplinary autism center. An emphasis was placed on results of the National Autism Center's National Standards Project. within each discipline, interventions exist that vary in level of evidenced-based support. Although disciplines may differ in their definitions of evidence-based treatments, it is important for each discipline to strive to offer and promote practices with the best evidenced-based support according to each field's standards.},
