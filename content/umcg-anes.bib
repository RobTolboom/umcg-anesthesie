  abstract = {Many patients experience nausea and vomiting after surgery, which can be very uncomfortable and may delay recovery. Despite preventive medications, this problem remains common, particularly in women, non-smokers and those with a previous history of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Our research aimed to improve PONV prevention for a quicker, and more comfortable recovery.
  We identified groups more likely to experience PONV, focusing on clinical factors, ethnicity and genetics. Notably, a specific gene (the C allele of P2RX7) may protect against vomiting. We also confirmed that individuals with a prior PONV or motion sickness are at a higher risk of experiencing it again. These insights could guide more personalised PONV prevention strategies in the future.
  Our study also evaluated medicines like olanzapine, aprepitant, and fosaprepitant. Combining certain drugs significantly reduced PONV, while others were less effective. Olanzapine, typically used for mental health conditions, worked well alongside standard treatments, significantly lowering the chances of PONV. However, aprepitant, a drug specifically approved to prevent PONV, did not show much benefit when combined with another drug called palonosetron. After reviewing available studies, we concluded that while these medications help prevent PONV, their effectiveness depends on how they are combined.
  Overall, our findings suggest that we can enhance the prevention of these unpleasant side effects by understanding patient’s individual risk factors and using a combination of medications targeting different factors contributing to PONV. These insights can help improve patient care by making recovery from surgery more comfortable and reducing the risk for complications.},

  abstract = {The presence of a hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease often presents with severe, disabling symptoms and is known to result into a poor quality-of-life for many patients. Nevertheless, it’s often seen by patients and physicians alike as an ailment to be treated by antacids, not as serious disease warranting surgery.  
  While most hiatal hernia are straightforward, in some rare cases the pancreas herniates along with the other organs into the thoracic cavity. Little is known about how to proceed surgically. Furthermore, some patients are hindered in their daily life by symptoms of delayed gastric emptying. Antireflux surgery is known to enhance gastric emptying speeds in most cases. Some patients, however, see their gastric emptying worsened. The mechanism behind this phenomenon remains mostly unclear.  
  When a hiatal hernia recurs or symptoms persist following primary antireflux surgery, a whole battery of diagnostic tests are done to find the mechanism of failure and therefore also the optimal mode of treatment. We hypothesize that computed tomography (CT) scanning of the gastroesphageal junction offers sufficient information to classify the underlying mechanism of failure.
  Current treatment of hiatal hernia is largely standardized in the Netherlands. Most centers perform partial laparoscopic fundoplications. Some centers, however, see benefits in using robotic assistance.  
  And finally, the question remains on how best to treat those patients with severe symptoms and poor quality-of-life following (multiple) previous failed antireflux surgeries and are currently left without any treatment options.  
  The aims of this thesis are to find out why the number of referrals for surgery remain lacking in the Netherlands, to describe our experience with intrathoracic herniation of the pancreas, to find the incidence of delayed gastric emptying in patients with large and small hiatal hernia, to describe the effects of surgery on gastric motility, to look at the value of CT-scanning in patients with recurrent disease, to look at the benefits of robotic assistance in primary and redo antireflux surgery, and to describe the development of a novel robot assisted transthoracic minimal-invasive approach for redo-antireflux surgery.},

The aim of this study was to understand the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of intranasal midazolam in older people with the primary goal of developing a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to facilitate safer domiciliary sedation care. We recruited 12 volunteers: ASA physical status 1-2, aged 65-80 yr, and received midazolam 5 mg intravenously and 5 mg intranasally on two study days separated by a 6 day washout period. Concentrations of venous midazolam and 1'-OH-midazolam, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score, bispectral index (BIS), arterial pressure, ECG, and respiratory parameters were measured for 10 h. Time to peak effect of intranasal midazolam for BIS, MAP, and SpO Intranasal bioavailability was high and sedation onset was rapid, with maximum sedative effects after 32 min. We developed a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for intranasal midazolam for older persons and an online tool to simulate changes in MOAA/S, BIS, MAP, and SpO EudraCT (2019-004806-90).},

  abstract = {Different bronchoscopic lung volume reduction approaches are available for a select group of patients with advanced COPD. General anaesthesia is the recommended method of sedation during these procedures. However, this patient population is at an increased risk of anaesthetic complications, and the best approach to general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation is unknown. The aims of this study were to describe the anaesthetic management techniques used during bronchoscopic lung volume reduction procedures and to investigate the number of anaesthesia-related events. Data were retrospectively collected from all endobronchial valve and lung volume reduction coil procedures performed between January 2018 and March 2020 in our hospital. Primary outcomes measures were anaesthetic technique including airway management; ventilation mode and settings; and the incidence of anaesthesia-related events, classified as catastrophic, severe, significant, or moderate. 202 procedures were included. One procedure was performed under procedural sedation, 198 (98%) under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation, and 3 (1.5%) under general anaesthesia with laryngeal mask airway. Volume-controlled ventilation was used in 64% of the procedures and pressure-controlled in 36%. Patients were ventilated with a median respiration rate of 9.9 (IQR: 9.6-10.6) breaths per minute, mean tidal volume of 5.8 ± 1.4 mL/kg, and median inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2.8 (IQR: 1:2.1-1:3.2). No catastrophic anaesthesia-related events were observed. Hypotension was the most observed anaesthesia-related event. Despite the presence of advanced COPD, general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation are well tolerated by patients undergoing endobronchial valve or lung volume reduction coil treatment. This is presumably strongly linked to the strict selection criteria. Other important considerations are using a low respiratory rate, low tidal volume, and high I:E ratio.},

We evaluated the reverse interaction and determined the influence of propofol on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam. Eight healthy male volunteers were studied on 2 occasions in a random crossover manner. During session A, volunteers received midazolam 0.035 to 0.05 mg x kg(-1) IV for 1 minute followed by an infusion of 0.035 to 0.05 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 59 minutes. During session B, in addition to this midazolam infusion scheme, a target-controlled infusion of propofol (constant C(T): 0.6 or 1.0 microg x mL(-1)) was given from 15 minutes before the start until 6 hours after termination of the midazolam infusion. Arterial blood samples for propofol and midazolam concentration analysis were taken until 6 hours after termination of the midazolam infusion. Nonlinear mixed-effect models examining the influence of propofol and hemodynamic variables on midazolam pharmacokinetics were constructed using Akaike's information-theoretic criterion for model selection. In the presence of a mean blood propofol concentration of 1.2 microg x mL(-1), the plasma midazolam concentration was increased by 26.9% + or - 9.4% compared with midazolam given as a single drug. Propofol (C(blood): 1.2 microg x mL(-1)) reduced midazolam central volume of distribution from 5.37 to 2.98 L, elimination clearance from 0.39 to 0.31 L x min(-1), and rapid distribution clearance from 2.77 to 2.11 L x min(-1). Inclusion of heart rate further improved the pharmacokinetic model of midazolam. Propofol reduces the distribution and clearance of midazolam in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, inclusion of heart rate as a covariate improved the pharmacokinetic model of midazolam predominantly through a reduction in the intraindividual variability.},

Together with novel intravenous administration devices and improved anaesthetic depth monitoring, this has created a basis for the optimisation of the administration of propofol-opioid anaesthesia. This article describes the current strategies regarding the application of this type of anaesthesia, focusing on three strategic tools: (i) application of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic knowledge of propofol and the opioids, with particular attention to pharmacodynamic interactions between them; (ii) the use of state-of-the-art administration techniques; and (iii) the application of bispectral index monitoring. Together, these techniques have improved the level of control, the flexibility and the safety of anaesthetic practice.},

Cholesterol-containing cationic liposomes that encapsulate complementary DNA (cDNA) are nonviral carriers used for in vivo gene transfection. We propose that liposome IGF-I gene transfer will accelerate wound healing in burned rats and attenuate deleterious side-effects associated with high levels of IGF-I. To test this hypothesis IGF-I gene constructs, encapsulated in liposomes, were studied for their efficacy in modulating the thermal injury response. Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a 60% TBSA scald burn and randomly divided into three groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the lacZ gene coding for beta-galactosidase, liposomes plus cDNA for IGF-I and beta-galactosidase or liposomes plus the rhIGF-I protein. Body weights and wound healing were measured. Muscle and liver dry/wet weights and IGF-I concentrations in serum, skin and liver were measured by radioimmunoassay. Transfection was confirmed by histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase. Rats receiving the IGF-I cDNA constructs exhibited the most rapid wound re-epithelialization and greatest increase in body weight and gastrocnemius muscle protein content (P < 0.05). Local IGF-I protein concentrations in the skin were higher when compared to liposomes containing only the lacZ gene (P < 0.05) Transfection was apparent in the cytoplasm of myofibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages of the granulation tissue. Liposomes containing the IGF-I gene constructs proved effective in preventing muscle protein wasting and preserving total body weight after a severe thermal injury.},

MdPE and MdAPE did not differ between groups during the pre-adjustment period (control group: 6.3% and 16%; intervention group: 5.4% and 18%). MdPE differed in the post-adjustment period (12% vs. -0.3%), but MdAPE did not (18% vs. 15%). No difference in heart rate, MAP or BIS was found.

Although the reasons may be many, the lack of a simplified algorithm for the assessment of DD specific to the perioperative arena, the implications of this diagnosis on clinical care, and the absence of therapeutic options are some of the commonly cited reasons. In this article, the authors address these possible reasons for the lack of routine application of Doppler indices to assess perioperative DD. The authors have chosen to highlight some of the most common conceptual questions, which often have been raised by anesthesiologists, and attempted to suggest answers. Drawing from their experience and data, the authors propose a simplified algorithm for the application of Doppler to assess and diagnose DD with an individualized and a mechanistic approach. The proposed algorithm is from within the premise of the published guidelines and attempts to simplify the perioperative approach. The authors hope this approach will be simple enough for routine application to affect therapy and a tangible change in outcome. The authors suggest that knowledge of left atrial size is valuable as a marker for persistently increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and its possible role in risk stratification.},

Additionally, TTM at 33 °C induced increased expression of TrkB and RBM3 in cortex and hippocampus of rats on CPB compared to TTM at 18 °C. Together, these data indicate that neuroinflammation is alleviated by TTM at 33 °C, possibly by recruiting protective mechanisms through cold shock protein induction.},

  abstract = {Chronic pain is often difficult to manage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients and sometimes even leads to nephrectomy. We analyzed the long-term efficacy of our innovative multidisciplinary protocol to treat chronic refractory pain that aims to preserve kidney function by applying among other sequential nerve blocks. Patients were eligible if pain was present ≥3 months with a score of ≥50 on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100, was negatively affecting quality of life and if there had been insufficient response to previous therapies, including opioid treatment. Treatment options were, in order, analgesics, cyst aspiration and fenestration, nerve blocks and nephrectomy. A total of 101 patients were assessed in our clinic (mean age 50 ± 11 years, 65.3% females). Eight patients were treated with medication, 6 by cyst aspiration or fenestration, 63 by nerve blocks and 6 received surgery as the first treatment option. Overall, 76.9% experienced a positive effect on pain complaints shortly after treatment. The VAS score was reduced from 60/100 to 20/100 (P < 0.001) and patients decreased their number of nonopioid and opioid analgesics significantly (P < 0.001, P = 0.01, respectively). A substantial number of the patients (n = 51) needed additional treatment. At the end of follow-up in only 13 patients (12.9%) was surgical intervention necessary: 11 nephrectomies (of which 10 were in patients already on kidney function replacement treatment), 1 liver transplantation and 1 partial hepatectomy. After a median follow-up of 4.5 years (interquartile range 2.5-5.3), 69.0% of the patients still had fewer pain complaints. These data indicate that our multidisciplinary treatment protocol appears effective in reducing pain in the majority of patients with chronic refractory pain, while postponing or even avoiding in most patients surgical interventions such as nephrectomy in most patients.},

  abstract = {Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients can suffer from chronic pain that can be refractory to conventional treatment, resulting in a wish for nephrectomy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol with sequential nerve blocks on pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain. As a first step a diagnostic, temporary celiac plexus block with local anesthetics was performed. If substantial pain relief was obtained, the assumption was that pain was relayed via the celiac plexus and major splanchnic nerves. When pain recurred, patients were then scheduled for a major splanchnic nerve block with radiofrequency ablation. In cases with no pain relief, it was assumed that pain was relayed via the aortico-renal plexus, and catheter-based renal denervation was performed. Sixty patients were referred, of which 44 were eligible. In 36 patients the diagnostic celiac plexus block resulted in substantial pain relief with a change in the median visual analogue scale (VAS) score pre-post intervention of 50/100. Of these patients, 23 received a major splanchnic nerve block because pain recurred, with a change in median VAS pre-post block of 53/100. In 8 patients without pain relief after the diagnostic block, renal denervation was performed in 5, with a borderline significant change in the median VAS pre-post intervention of 20/100. After a median follow-up of 12 months, 81.8% of the patients experienced a sustained improvement in pain intensity, indicating that our treatment protocol is effective in obtaining pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain.},

Relevant outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS research have not been previously defined. National consensus was sought to identify relevant long term patient outcome parameters, process outcome parameters and performance outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS care. This was a mixed methods Delphi consensus study. A list of potentially relevant outcome parameters was identified using a systematic literature review. These parameters were subsequently surveyed in a Delphi consensus study. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services physicians and relevant stakeholders were invited to participate in this Delphi survey, where they were allowed to suggest additional outcome parameters. Descriptive analysis was performed on all data sets. Forty-nine potential outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS care were surveyed. Of 71 invited participants, 53 (75%), 40 (56%), and 20 (28%) participated in the first, second, and third round of the Delphi study, respectively. Consensus was reached on 25 (51%) of 49 outcome parameters as being important. These consisted of seven long term patient related outcome parameters, four short term patient related outcome parameters, five process outcome parameters and nine performance outcome parameters. In conclusion, this study identified 25 outcome parameters relevant for Dutch physician staffed HEMS care. These parameters should be considered when designing future studies and should be routinely collected for each dispatch if possible.},

The associations of the number of shuttles completed and cardiopulmonary capacity as measured with a portable gas analyser were r > 0.7, confirming good convergent validity in subacute and chronic people with stroke. Criterion validity, however, indicates it is not a valid test for measuring maximal cardiopulmonary capacity (VO2max). Only 60% of participants were able to reach the 1stVT. Higher cardiopulmonary capacity and a higher total score of the lower extremity Motricity Index contributed significantly to a higher number of shuttles walked (p = 0.001).

The study included 99 consecutive patients with simple dextro-transposition of the great arteries with or without a ventricular septal defect. All patients received preoperative management including intravenous prostaglandin E1 and, when necessary, a balloon atrial septostomy. Patients were then scheduled for an arterial switch operation. Patients were divided into a PPHN and a non-PPHN group. The outcomes assessed included mortality (overall, preoperative, 30-day postoperative and late mortality) and postoperative morbidity (length of ventilatory support, intensive care unit and hospital stay, delayed sternal closure and resternotomy). PPHN was present in 31% of patients. Overall mortality was 8.1%, with no difference between PPHN and non-PPHN patients (9.7 v 7.4%, p = 0.70). PPHN had no effect on morbidity outcomes. A lower weight at birth was associated with preoperative mortality. Duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative hypotension were associated with longer intensive care unit stay. Intraoperative hypotension and cerebral oxygen desaturation had no significant impact on mortality. PPHN did not significantly affect perioperative morbidity and mortality in d-TGA patients, suggesting a more favorable prognosis than previously reported.},

We present the case of a 55-year-old man undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery for severe MR caused by posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe MR with no significant aortic valve abnormalities. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) initially showed a high transvalvular aortic gradient (3 m/s) in the transgastric long-axis view, suggestive of mild-to-moderate AS. However, detailed Doppler analysis revealed a double envelope signal, representing both eccentric MR and true aortic valve flow. The closer evaluation showed the MR signal occurred earlier in the cardiac cycle, aligning with its hemodynamic timing, while the true aortic flow followed isovolumetric contraction. Subsequent three-dimensional TEE confirmed normal aortic valve morphology and function. This case highlights the importance of correlating preoperative findings, Doppler signal timing, and imaging data to avoid misdiagnosis. Systematic echocardiographic evaluation, including signal timing analysis, can differentiate between MR and AS, ensuring accurate intraoperative decision-making and preventing unnecessary interventions.},

  abstract = {The exact onset of brain injury in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. Our aim was, therefore, to assess the association between prenatal Doppler flow patterns, postnatal cerebral oxygenation and short-term neurological outcome. Prenatally, we measured pulsatility indices of the middle cerebral (MCA-PI) and umbilical artery (UA-PI) and calculated cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). After birth, cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) were assessed during the first 3 days after birth, and during and for 24 hours after every surgical procedure within the first 3 months after birth. Neurological outcome was determined preoperatively and at 3 months of age by assessing general movements and calculating the Motor Optimality Score (MOS). Thirty-six infants were included. MOS at 3 months was associated with MCA-PI (rho 0.41, P = 0.04), UA-PI (rho -0.39, P = 0.047, and CPR (rho 0.50, P = 0.01). Infants with abnormal MOS had lower MCA-PI (P = 0.02) and CPR (P = 0.01) and higher UA-PI at the last measurement (P = 0.03) before birth. In infants with abnormal MOS, rcSO2 tended to be lower during the first 3 days after birth, and FTOE was significantly higher on the second day after birth (P = 0.04). Intraoperative and postoperative rcSO2 and FTOE were not associated with short-term neurological outcome. In infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD, the prenatal period may play an important role in developmental outcome. Additional research is needed to clarify the relationship between preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative cerebral oxygenation and developmental outcome in infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD.},

In acute normovolemic haemodilution autologous unfractionated heparinised blood is stored ex-vivo and retransfused at the end of the procedure to reduce (allogeneic) transfusion requirements. In this observational study we assessed whether platelet function is better preserved in ex vivo stored autologous blood compared to platelet function in the patient during CPB. We measured platelet aggregation responses pre-CPB, 5 min after the start of CPB, at the end of CPB, and after unfractionated heparin reversal, using multiple electrode aggregometry (Multiplate®) with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) and ristocetin activated test cells. We compared blood samples taken from the patient with samples taken from 100 ml ex-vivo stored blood, which we took to mimick blood storage during normovolemic haemodilution. Platelet function declined both in ex-vivo stored blood as well as in blood taken from the patient. At the end of CPB there were no differences in platelet aggregation responses between samples from the ex vivo stored blood and the patient. Ex vivo preservation of autologous blood in unfractionated heparin does not seem to be profitable to preserve platelet function.},

Single-center retrospective exploratory cohort cost study. The study is performed from a hospital perspective with a time horizon of patients' complete hospital admission in which they received extracorporeal life support.

All 67 consecutive adult patients who were admitted to the ICU of the University Medical Center Groningen in the period 2010-2013 and received extracorporeal life support treatment. None. The bottom-up microcosting method was used except when stated otherwise. Medical costs were estimated by multiplying every registered healthcare consumption with unit prices. Unit prices were largely based on Dutch reference prices. For each patient, the personnel costs and material costs were assessed in detail. The costs of extracorporeal life support were differentiated in costs of procedures and costs of daily surcharge of therapy. Procedure-related costs were subdivided in costs of devices and disposables, costs of additional human resources, and surgery hours. The mean total hospital costs were € 106.263 (€ 83.841 to € 126.266) per patient ($145,580). On average, 52% of the total costs arose from hospital nursing days and 11% of direct procedure-related extracorporeal life support costs. Surgery and diagnostics represented a vast amount of the remaining costs. This large and detailed economic evaluation of hospital costs of extracorporeal life support therapy in the Netherlands showed that mean total hospital cost of extracorporeal life support treatment is € 106.263 per patient. The majority of the costs are composed of nursing days.},

We successfully implanted a transcatheter aortic valve in emergency setting. The patient recovered and underwent cardiac transplantation three months afterwards. We performed a systematic literature review and identified 10 cases of patients with a left ventricle assist device undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation. In these cases, there was no procedural related mortality reported. In four (40%) patients, transcatheter aortic valve implantation resulted in significant paravalvular aortic regurgitation. In two of these cases it was due to migration of the valve towards the left ventricle. Our case report and review of literature suggests that transcatheter aortic valve implantation is a feasible and lifesaving treatment option for left ventricle assist device patients presenting with severe aortic regurgitation.},

Supplementation of additional bivalirudin (23 ± 1.1 μg/ml/hr) and prevention of stasis was not able to prevent thrombin generation.

  abstract = {Anemia is a common feature during sepsis that occurs due to iatrogenic blood loss, depression of serum iron levels and erythropoietin production, and a decreased lifespan of erythrocytes. However, these mechanisms are unlikely to play a role in anemia at the start of sepsis. Moreover, sequestration of fluids, renal failure and increase of intravascular space may additionally influence the change in hemoglobin concentration during intravenous fluid administration in the acute phase of sepsis. In this retrospective study, patients who were admitted acutely to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. Patients who fulfilled the international criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock were included in the sepsis group (S-group). The remaining patients were allocated to the control group (C-group). Laboratory data from blood samples taken at first presentation to the hospital and at admission to the ICU, the amount of intravenous fluid administration and length of stay in the emergency department were collected and tested for significant differences between groups. The difference in hemoglobin concentration between the S-group (n = 296) and C-group (n = 320) at first presentation in hospital was not significant (8.8 ± 1.2 versus 8.9 ± 1.2 mmol/l, respectively, p = 0.07). The reduction in hemoglobin concentration from the first presentation at the emergency department to ICU admission was significantly greater in the S-group compared to the C-group (1 [0.5-1.7] versus 0.5 [0.1-1.1] mmol/l, (p < 0.001)). Spearman rho correlation coefficients between the reduction in hemoglobin concentration and the amount of intravenous fluids administered or the creatinine level in the emergency department were significant (0.3 and 0.4, respectively, p < 0.001). In a multivariate regression analysis, creatinine, the amount of fluid administration and the presence of sepsis remained independently associated. Prior to in-hospital intravenous fluid administration, there is no significant difference in hemoglobin concentration between acute septic patients and acutely ill controls. Within several hours after hospital admission, there is a significant reduction in hemoglobin concentration, not only associated with the amount of intravenous fluids administered and the creatinine level, but also independently with sepsis itself.},

  abstract = {Individuals can make choices based on information learned from others, a phenomenon called social learning. How observers differentiate between which individual they should or should not learn from is, however, poorly understood. Here, we showed that Drosophila melanogaster females can influence the choice of egg-laying site of other females through pheromonal marking. Mated females mark territories of high quality food by ejecting surplus male sperm containing the aggregation pheromone cis-11-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) and, in addition, deposit several sex- and species-specific cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) pheromones. These pheromonal cues affect the choices of other females, which respond by preferentially laying eggs on the marked food. This system benefits both senders and responders, as communal egg laying increases offspring survival. Virgin females, however, do not elicit a change in the egg-laying decision of mated females, even when food has been supplemented with ejected sperm from mated females, thus indicating the necessity for additional cues. Genetic ablation of either a female's CHC pheromones or those of their mate results in loss of ability of mated females to attract other females. We conclude that mated females use a pheromonal marking system, comprising cVA acquired from male ejaculate with sex- and species-specific CHCs produced by both mates, to indicate egg-laying sites. This system ensures information reliability because mated, but not virgin, females have both the ability to generate the pheromone blend that attracts other flies to those sites and a direct interest in egg-laying site quality.},

However, previous studies have failed to significantly reduce the time from cardiac arrest to ECMO flow to less than 60 min. We hypothesize that the initiation of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) by a Helicopter Emergency Medical Services System (HEMS) will reduce the low flow time and improve outcomes in refractory Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) patients. The ON-SCENE study will use a non-randomised stepped wedge design to implement ECPR in patients with witnessed OHCA between the ages of 18-50 years old, with an initial presentation of shockable rhythm or pulseless electrical activity with a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism, lasting more than 20, but less than 45 min. Patients will be treated by the ambulance crew and HEMS with prehospital ECPR capabilities and will be compared with treatment by ambulance crew and HEMS without prehospital ECPR capabilities. The primary outcome measure will be survival at hospital discharge. The secondary outcome measure will be good neurological outcome defined as a cerebral performance categories scale score of 1 or 2 at 6 and 12 months.

Increased polyol concentrations have been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neurological patients with and without diabetes mellitus. However, polyol levels in patients without evident neurological abnormalities have not been investigated so far. The aim of this study was to determine CSF polyol concentrations in patients without major neurological disease with normal or elevated CSF glucose concentrations. This observational cohort study used CSF and plasma analyses, as well as clinical data, from 30 participants of the Anaesthetic Biobank of Cerebrospinal Fluid study. Biomaterial was collected from adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under spinal anaesthesia. CSF polyol concentrations were measured by GC/flame ionisation detector in ten patients with normal CSF glucose levels (group 1), ten patients with elevated CSF glucose levels (group 2) and ten patients with elevated CSF glucose levels and type 2 diabetes (group 3). We compared the concentrations of plasma glucose, CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose, and CSF polyol/glucose ratios between the three groups, and determined the correlation between plasma glucose levels and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose levels. Groups 2 and 3 had significantly higher CSF fructose levels compared with group 1 (p=0.036 and p<0.001, respectively). Group 3 showed significant differences compared with groups 1 and 2 for CSF sorbitol (p<0.001 and 0.036, respectively). Moreover, patients with diabetes had a significantly higher CSF sorbitol/glucose ratio compared with patients without diabetes. There was a strong positive correlation between plasma glucose and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose. Finally, age, sex, CSF/plasma albumin ratio and preoperative cognitive function scores were significantly correlated with plasma glucose and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose levels. Hyperglycaemia causes a proportional increase in polyol concentrations in CSF of patients without major neurological disease. Furthermore, this study provides the first indication of upregulation of the cerebral polyol pathway in patients with diabetes without evident neurological abnormalities.},

Neurological outcome was classified as cerebral performance category (CPC) at hospital discharge and long-term survival was compared with younger patients and predicted survival rates of the general population. Of the 810 patients admitted after OHCA, a total of 551 patients (68%) achieved return of spontaneous circulation, including 125 (23%) elderly patients with a mean age of 81 ± 5 years. In-hospital survival was lower in elderly patients compared with younger patients with rates of 33% versus 57% ( p < 0.001). A CPC of 1 was present in 73% of the elderly patients versus 86% of the younger patients ( p = 0.031). In 7.3% of the elderly patients, a CPC >2 was observed versus 2.5% of their younger counterparts ( p = 0.103).

  abstract = {Oncologic surgery results in substantially higher morbidity and mortality rates in older patients compared to younger patients, yet little is known about the relation between the preoperative inflammatory state and postoperative outcome in the specific group of older cancer patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether preoperative inflammatory markers could be a predictor of overall survival in older patients undergoing elective surgery for a solid malignant tumor. Patients 65 years and older undergoing surgery for a solid malignant tumor were included in a prospective cohort study. Inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL10, IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) were measured in plasma samples preoperatively. The main outcome was overall survival three years after surgery. Between 2010 and 2016, 328 patients with a median age of 71.5 years (range 65-89) were included. A significantly higher mortality rate three years after surgery, was found in patients with high preoperative plasma levels of CRP and IL-6 (},

  abstract = {Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using a mixture of propofol and remifentanil in the same syringe has become an accepted technique in Pediatric Anesthesia. A survey by a group of respected UK anesthetists demonstrated a low incidence of serious complications, related to the pharmacology and dose of the drugs. However, a current guideline for the safe use of TIVA recommends against this practice. Pharmaceutical concerns include the physical stability of the emulsion when remifentanil is mixed with propofol; changes in drug concentration over time; nonuniform mixing of propofol and remifentanil; the risk of bacterial contamination; and the potential for drug administration errors. Propofol and remifentanil have markedly different pharmacokinetic profiles. When remifentanil is mixed with propofol and delivered as a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol, remifentanil delivery is not target-controlled but passively follows the variable infusion rates calculated by the syringe driver to deliver predicted plasma or effect-site concentrations of propofol. The pharmacokinetic consequences can be illustrated using pharmacokinetic modeling similar to that used in TCI pumps. The clinical consequences reflect the dose-dependent pharmacodynamics of remifentanil. Increasing the target propofol concentration produces a rapid increase and peak in remifentanil concentration that risks apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension, especially with higher concentrations of remifentanil. The faster decline in remifentanil concentration with falling propofol concentrations risks inadequate narcosis and unwanted responses to surgical stimuli. Remifentanil delivery is inflexible and dosing cannot be adjusted to the clinical need and responses of individual patients. The medicolegal considerations are stark. In UK and EU Law, mixing propofol and remifentanil creates a new, unlicensed drug and the person mixing takes on the responsibilities of manufacturer. If a patient receiving anesthesia in the form of a mixed propofol-remifentanil infusion suffered a critical incident or actual harm, the clinician's practice may come under scrutiny and criticism, potentially involving a legal challenge and the Medical Regulator.},

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to 30 May 2024. Studies in adults undergoing LT where PCC exposure was reported in relation to clinical outcomes were included. Random effects models were used to obtain pooled effect estimates. All studies were retrospective, with seven reporting the number of patients receiving PCC [392/1901 (21%)], and one grouping patients receiving different factor concentrates together [576/939 (61%)]. Patients receiving PCC had worse preoperative coagulopathy, model for end-stage liver disease scores, and comorbidities. Patients exposed to PCC had a comparable mean number of red blood cell (RBC), plasma, or platelet units transfused. Use of viscoelastic testing-based algorithms incorporating PCC compared with usual care was associated with reduced odds of RBC exposure (odds ratio [OR]: 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-0.86, I Although there are no randomised trials comparing use of PCC vs FP in LT, their efficacy and safety appear comparable. Higher-quality studies are needed to assess PCC use for coagulopathic bleeding in LT.},

However, severe cardiac failure due to COVID-19 seems to be rare. A 30-year-old woman presented with COVID-19 and cardiogenic shock due to a lymphocytic myocarditis. Since she deteriorated under treatment with inotropes, she was referred to our centre, and veno-arterial extracorporeal life support was started. Subsequently, the aortic valve only opened sporadically, and spontaneous contrast appeared in the left ventricle (LV), pointing towards difficulties with unloading LV. Therefore, an Impella for venting the LV was implanted. After 6 days of mechanical circulatory support, her heart function recovered. All support could be weaned, and 2 months later, she had made a full recovery. We presented a patient with severe cardiogenic shock due to an acute virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the precise aetiology of SARS-CoV-2-related myocarditis remains to be elucidated and no virus could be detected in the heart, a causal relationship remains speculative.},

Recto-perineal and recto-vestibular fistulas were classified as mild CARMs, all others as severe. Significant patent foramen ovale, secundum atrial septal defect, and small ventricular septum defect were classified as minor CHDs, all others as major. Of 129 patients with CARM, 67% had mild CARM, 33% severe CARM, and 17% were additionally diagnosed with CHD. CHDs were distributed equally in patients with mild or severe CARMs. Patients with multiple congenital abnormalities were more frequently diagnosed with CHD (n = 16, 36%) than patients without multiple congenital malformations (n = 5, 9%, P = .001). Patients with CARM diagnosed with CHD using pediatric cardiac echo screening were younger than 3 months of age at diagnosis. Earlier general pediatric examinations missed 7 (50%) children with mild and 4 (50%) with severe CHDs. The severity of CARM could predict neither prevalence nor severity of CHD. More than one-half of CHDs were missed during the first physical examination. No new CHDs were found in patients older than 3 months of age at the time CARMs were diagnosed. We recommend screening all patients with CARM younger than 3 months of age for CHD at the time CARM is diagnosed. Preoperative echocardiography should be the rule in children younger than 3 months of age and with multiple congenital anomalies.},

Nevertheless, it is frequently prescribed to pediatric patients as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia or for procedural sedation. There is ample literature on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in this vulnerable patient population, but there is a general lack of consensus on dosing. In this project, we aimed to use the standardized workflow of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary to establish best evidence-based pediatric dosing guidelines for dexmedetomidine as premedication and for procedural sedation. The available literature on dexmedetomidine in pediatrics was reviewed in order to address the following three questions: (1) What is the right dose? (2) What is known about efficacy? (3) What is known about safety? Relevant literature was compiled into a risk-benefit analysis document. A team of clinical experts critically appraised the analysis and the proposed dosing recommendations. Dexmedetomidine is most commonly administered via the intravenous or intranasal route. Clearance is age dependent, warranting higher doses in infants to reach similar exposure as in adults. Dexmedetomidine use results in satisfactory sedation at parent separation, adequate sedation and a favorable recovery profile. The safety profile is good and comparable to adults, with dose-related hemodynamic effects. Following the structured approach of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary, best evidence-based dosing recommendations were proposed for dexmedetomidine, used as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia (intranasal dose) and for procedural sedation (intranasal and intravenous dose) in pediatric patients.},

Retrospective cohort study. The study was performed at the University Medical Centre Groningen in the 4 years between 1 January 2010 and the 31 December 2013. Complications and their severity were graded according to the standard complication score (20 items) of the Dutch Society of Anaesthesia. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for the reported complications. A total of 81 267 anaesthetic cases were included. In the paediatric cohort, there were 410 (2.9%) complications and 1675 (2.5%) in the adults. In both cohorts age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists classification and emergency treatment were independent risk factors for complications. With respect to age, infants less than 1 year were at the highest risk, whereas in the adult cohort, increased age was related to a greater number of complications. The incidences of the specific complications were different between both cohorts. Upper airway obstruction was more frequently observed in paediatric patients (26%), whereas in the adults, complications with the highest incidence concerned conversion of regional-to-general anaesthesia (25%) and hypotension (17%). Risk factors for all peri-operative complications were similar for paediatric and adult anaesthesia. However, the incidence of specific complications differed between both age categories.},

Knowledge on current pain assessment and treatment in BU is necessary to develop and implement a future guideline on pain management in BU. A mixed methods approach was used, consisting of information retrieved from medical records on prescribed pain medication from Ghana and Benin, and semi-structured interviews with health care personnel (HCP) from Ghana on pain perceptions, assessment and treatment. Medical records (n = 149) of patients treated between 2008 and 2012 were collected between November 2012 and August 2013. Interviews (n = 11) were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and qualitatively analyzed. In 113 (84%) of the 135 included records, pain medication, mostly simple analgesics, was prescribed. In 48% of the prescriptions, an indication was not documented. HCP reported that advanced BU could be painful, especially after wound care and after a skin graft. They reported not be trained in the assessment of mild pain. Pain recognition was perceived as difficult, as patients were said to suppress or to exaggerate pain, and to have different expectations regarding acceptable pain levels. HCP reported a fear of side effects of pain medication, shortage and irregularities in the supply of pain medication, and time constraints among medical doctors for pain management. Professionals perceived BU disease as potentially painful, and predominantly focused on severe pain. Our study suggests that pain in BU deserves attention and should be integrated in current treatment.},

We examined whether middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients show reduced white matter integrity in fiber tracts important for cognition and whether this abnormality is related to preestablished altered resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN). Diabetic and nondiabetic participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessment. Multiple diffusion measures were calculated using streamline tractography, and correlations with DMN functional connectivity were determined. Diabetic patients showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (a measure of white matter integrity) in the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus. Control subjects showed stronger functional connectivity than patients between the posterior cingulate and both left fusiform and medial frontal gyri. FA of the cingulum bundle was correlated with functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus for combined groups. Thus, middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes show white matter abnormalities that correlate with disrupted functional connectivity in the DMN, suggesting that common mechanisms may underlie structural and functional connectivity. Detecting brain abnormalities in middle age enables implementation of therapies to slow progression of neuropathology.},

  abstract = {Multiple pregnancies are high risk pregnancies with higher chances of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. In the past decades the number of multiple pregnancies has increased. This trend is partly due to the fact that women start family planning at an increased age, but also due to the increased use of ART.Couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility generally receive intrauterine insemination IUI with controlled hormonal stimulation (IUI COH). The cumulative pregnancy rate is 40%, with a 10% multiple pregnancy rate.This study aims to reveal whether alternative treatments such as IVF elective Single Embryo Transfer (IVF e SET) or Modified Natural Cycle IVF (MNC IVF) can reduce the number of multiple pregnancy rates, but uphold similar pregnancy rates as IUI COH in couples with mild male or unexplained subfertility. Secondly, the aim is to perform a cost effective analyses and assess treatment preference of these couples. We plan a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of intra-uterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation or six cycles of Modified Natural Cycle (MNC) IVF or three cycles with IVF-elective Single Embryo Transfer (eSET) plus cryo-cycles within a time frame of 12 months.Couples with unexplained subfertility or mild male subfertility and a poor prognosis for treatment independent pregnancy will be included. Women with anovulatory cycles, severe endometriosis, double sided tubal pathology or serious endocrine illness will be excluded.Our primary outcome is the birth of a healthy singleton. Secondary outcomes are multiple pregnancy, treatment costs, and patient experiences in each treatment arm. The analysis will be performed according tot the intention to treat principle. We will test for non-inferiority of the three arms with respect to live birth. As we accept a 12.5% loss in pregnancy rate in one of the two IVF arms to prevent multiple pregnancies, we need 200 couples per arm (600 couples in total). Determining the safest and most cost-effective treatment will ensure optimal chances of pregnancy for subfertile couples with substantially diminished perinatal and maternal complications. Should patients find the most cost-effective treatment acceptable or even preferable, this could imply the need for a world wide shift in the primary treatment.

If women do not conceive, treatment can be continued with gonadotropins or intra-uterine insemination (IUI). At present, it is unclear for how many cycles ovulation induction with CC should be repeated, and when to switch to ovulation induction with gonadotropins and/or IUI. We started a multicenter randomised controlled trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of CC plus intercourse or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus intercourse or six cycles of CC plus IUI or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus IUI.Women with WHO type II anovulation who ovulate but did not conceive after six ovulatory cycles of CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days will be included.Our primary outcome is birth of a healthy child resulting from a pregnancy that was established in the first eight months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and treatment costs. The analysis will be performed according to the intention to treat principle. Two comparisons will be made, one in which CC is compared to gonadotrophins and one in which the addition of IUI is compared to ovulation induction only. Assuming a live birth rate of 40% after CC, 55% after addition of IUI and 55% after ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, with an alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, we need to recruit 200 women per arm (800 women in total).An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee has criticized the data of the first 150 women and concluded that a sample size re-estimation should be performed after including 320 patients (i.e. 80 per arm).

We constructed a second prediction model (PCT model) based on the reference model including the PCT. Primary endpoint in this study was ongoing pregnancy. We evaluated the performance of the PCT model in comparison with the reference model by calculating goodness of fit, discrimination, calibration, and the "net reclassification improvement". We included 3,021 couples of whom 537 (18%) had a spontaneous pregnancy and 55 (1.8%) a nonsuccessful pregnancy; 1,316 (44%) started treatment within 12 months, 824 (27%) neither started treatment nor became pregnant, and 289 (10%) became lost to follow-up within 12 months. The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62 to 0.94). The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.84) in case of no spermatozoa, 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57 to 1.2) in case of nonmotile spermatozoa, and 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.8) in case of motile, nonprogressive spermatozoa. Adding the PCT result to the reference model did not improve goodness of fit. Discrimination was equally poor for the PCT model and the reference model. The calibration plots of both models showed comparably good calibration. The net reclassification improvement of the predictions of the PCT model compared with the reference model was -1.1%. This study demonstrated that the PCT has prognostic value but does not add substantially to a prognostic model for spontaneous pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Anovulation is a common cause of female subfertility. Treatment of anovulation is aimed at induction of ovulation. In women with clomiphene-citrate resistant WHO group II anovulation, one of the treatment options is ovulation induction with exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH or follitropin). FSH is derived from urine or is produced as recombinant FSH. Two forms of recombinant FSH are available - follitropin alpha and follitropin beta. To evaluate the efficacy, safety, costs and acceptability of recombinant FSH, we performed a review to compare recombinant FSH with urinary-derived FSH products. Follitropin alpha, beta and urinary FSH products appeared to be equally effective in terms of pregnancy rates. Patient safety was also found to be comparable, as the incidence of side effects including multiple pregnancies was similar for all FSH products. In practice follitropin alpha and beta may be more convenient to use due to the ease of self-administration, but they are also more expensive than the urinary products.},

In a retrospective study in four large teaching hospitals, all subfertile women who underwent a THL and a conventional laparoscopy as part of their fertility work-up in the period between 2000 and 2011 were studied. Findings at THL were compared with findings at diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopies. Tubal occlusion, endometriosis and adhesions were defined as abnormalities. Out of 1119 women, 1103 women underwent THL. A complete evaluation or incomplete but diagnostic procedure could be performed in 989 (89.7%) and 28 (2.5%), respectively. An incomplete non-diagnostic procedure was performed in 11 (1.0%) women. Failure of THL occurred in 75 women (6.8%) and 40 of these women (3.6%) subsequently underwent laparoscopy. Laparoscopy was performed in a total of 126 patients with a median time interval of 7 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 3-13 weeks). Of 64 patients who successfully underwent both THL and laparoscopy, concordant findings were found in 53 women and discordant results in 11 women, 6 of which were caused by tubal spasm. Sensitivity of THL in detecting abnormalities was 100% and specificity was 22.2%, with a likelihood ratio of 1.29. THL in an outpatient setting can detect anatomical abnormalities comparable to the more invasive reference standard diagnostic laparoscopy. If THL succeeds, there is no need to add a diagnostic laparoscopy in the work-up.},

The primary outcome measure was intrauterine pregnancy, either after natural conception or after treatment with intrauterine insemination or ovulation induction. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and fecundity rate ratios (FRR) were established. THL showed bilateral patent tubes in 83%, one-sided tubal occlusion in 12.4% and bilateral tubal occlusion in 4.6% of women. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates after 36 months were 52% for women with bilateral patent tubes, 44% for one-sided tubal occlusion (FRR 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.39) and 7% for bilateral tubal occlusion (FRR 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.43). Endometriosis was diagnosed in 6.4%, and adhesions in 9.1%, while 3.9% of women had both. Corresponding FRR were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.09), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.46 to 1.02) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.84). In conclusion, women with bilateral tubal occlusion or a combination of endometriosis and adhesions found on THL significantly reduced chances of natural conception.},

A European expert meeting was organized in Brussels, Belgium by the Benelux Neuromodulation Society in order to develop uniform MCS protocols in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses. An expert meeting was organized, and a questionnaire was sent out to all the invited participants before this expert meeting. An extensive literature research was conducted in order to enrich the results. Topics that were addressed during the expert meeting were 1) inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2) targeting and methods of stimulation, 3) effects of MCS, and 4) results from the questionnaire. Substantial commonalities but also important methodologic divergencies emerged from the discussion of MCS experts from 7 European Centers. From this meeting and questionnaire, all participants concluded that there is a need for more homogenous standardized protocols for MCS regarding patient selection, implantation procedure, stimulation parameters, and follow-up-course.},

So, in order to minimize invasiveness while optimizing repeatability, we sought to create an easily reproducible single-access port operative strategy. Four patients suffering from intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis for >10 years (12.8 ± 5.9) underwent a single-port unilateral R5-R11 splanchnotomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. No operative complications were observed. All 4 patients experienced excellent pain relief with a significant improvement of Visual Analogue Scale pain scores (8.8 ± 1.0 preoperatively to 3.0 ± 1.2 postoperatively, P = 0.003). We report the first series of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) splanchnotomy for palliation of intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis. From this small study, single-port VATS splanchnotomy seems to be a safe and effective alternative to multiportal or open procedures.},

Plant-based production systems for terpenoids critically depend on the availability of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Currently, these systems show insufficient yields, due to the competition for FPP of newly introduced pathways with endogenous ones. In this study, for the first time an RNAi strategy aiming at silencing of endogenous pathways for increased (+)-valencene production was employed. Firstly, a transient production system for (+)-valencene in Nicotiana benthamiana was set up using agroinfiltration. Secondly, silencing of the endogenous 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS) and squalene synthase (SQS) that compete for the FPP pool was deployed. This resulted in a N. benthamiana plant that produces (+)-valencene as a prevalent volatile with a 2.8-fold increased yield. Finally, the size of the FPP pool was increased by overexpression of enzymes that are rate-limiting in FPP biosynthesis. Combined with silencing of EAS and SQS, no further increase of (+)-valencene production was observed, but emission of farnesol. Formation of farnesol, which is a breakdown product of FPP, indicates that overproducing sesquiterpenes is no longer limited by FPP availability in the cytosol. This study shows that metabolic engineering of plants can effectively be used for increased production of desired products in plants.},

Plant genomes often encode a number of related terpene synthases, which can produce very different terpenes. The relationship between TPS sequence and resulting terpene product is not completely understood. In this work we describe two TPSs from the Camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. One of these, CiCaMS, acts as a monoterpene synthase (monoTPS), and mediates the production of myrcene, while the other, CiCaSSy, acts as a sesquiterpene synthase (sesquiTPS), and catalyses the production of α-santalene, β-santalene and trans-α-bergamotene. Interestingly, these enzymes share 97% DNA sequence identity and differ only in 22 amino acid residues out of 553. To understand which residues are essential for the catalysis of monoterpenes resp. sesquiterpenes, a number of hybrid synthases were prepared, and supplemented by a set of single-residue variants. These were tested for their ability to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes by in vivo production of sesquiterpenes in E. coli, and by in vitro enzyme assays. This analysis pinpointed three residues in the sequence which could mediate the change in product specificity from a monoterpene synthase to a sesquiterpene synthase. Another set of three residues defined the sesquiterpene product profile, including the ratios between sesquiterpene products.},

  abstract = {Most secreted proteins in eukaryotes are modified on the amino acid consensus sequence NxS/T by an N-glycan through the process of N-glycosylation. The N-glycans on glycoproteins are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to different mannose-type N-glycans or, when the protein passes through the Golgi apparatus, to different complex glycan forms. Here we describe the capturing of N-glycopeptides from a trypsin digest of total protein extracts of Arabidopsis plants and release of these captured peptides following Peptide N-glycosidase (PNGase) treatment for analysis of N-glycan site-occupancy. The mixture of peptides released as a consequence of the PNGase treatment was analyzed by two dimensional nano-LC-MS. As the PNGase treatment of glycopeptides results in the deamidation of the asparagine (N) in the NxS/T site of the released peptide, this asparagine (N) to aspartic acid (D) conversion is used as a glycosylation 'signature'. The efficiency of PNGase F and PNGase A in peptide release is discussed. The identification of proteins with a single glycopeptide was limited by the used search algorithm but could be improved using a reference database including deamidated peptide sequences. Additional stringency settings were used for filtering results to minimize false discovery. This resulted in identification of 330 glycopeptides on 173 glycoproteins from Arabidopsis, of which 28 putative glycoproteins, that were previously not annotated as secreted protein in The Arabidopsis Information Resource database (TAIR). Furthermore, the identified glycosylation site occupancy helped to determine the correct topology for membrane proteins. A quantitative comparison of peptide signal was made between wild type and complex-glycan-less (cgl) mutant Arabidopsis from three replicate leaf samples using a label-free MS peak comparison. As an example, the identified membrane protein SKU5 (AT4G12420) showed differential glycopeptide intensity ratios between WT and cgl indicating heterogeneous glycan modification on single protein. Proteins that enter the secretory pathway are mostly modified by N-glycans. The function of N-glycosylation has been well studied in mammals. However, in plants the function of N-glycosylation is still unclear, because glycosylation mutants in plants often do not have a clear phenotype. Here we analyzed which proteins are modified by N-glycans in plants by developing a glycopeptide enrichment method for plant proteins. Subsequently, label free comparative proteomics was employed using protein fractions from wild type and from a mutant which is blocked in modification of the N-glycan into complex glycans. The results provide new information on N-glycosylation sites on numerous secreted proteins. Results allow for specific mapping of multiple glycosylation site occupancy on proteins, which provides information on which glycosylation sites are protected or non-used from downstream processing and thus presumably are buried into the protein structure. Glycoproteomics can therefore contribute to protein structure analysis. Indeed, mapping the glycosylation sites on membrane proteins gives information on the topology of protein folds over the membrane. We thus were able to correct the topology prediction of three membrane proteins. Besides, these studies also identified limitations in the software that is used to identify single modified peptide per protein.

Here, we established the biotechnological production of indole upon L-tryptophan supplementation in the bacterial host Corynebacterium glutamicum. Heterologous expression of the tryptophanase gene from E. coli enabled the conversion of supplemented L-tryptophan to indole. Engineering of the substrate import by co-expression of the native aromatic amino acid permease gene aroP increased whole-cell biotransformation of L-tryptophan to indole by two-fold.

Besides, inulin chicory taproots also accumulate sesquiterpene lactones (STLs). These are bitter tasting compounds, which need to be removed during inulin extraction, resulting in additional costs. In this work, we describe chicory lines where STL accumulation is almost completely eliminated. Genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to inactivate four genes that encode the enzyme that performs the first dedicated step in STL synthesis, germacrene A synthase (CiGAS). Chicory lines were obtained that carried null mutations in all four CiGAS genes. Lines lacking functional CiGAS alleles showed a normal phenotype upon greenhouse cultivation and show nearly complete elimination of the STL synthesis in the roots. It was shown that the reduction in STLs could be attributed to mutations in genetically linked copies of the CiGAS-short gene and not the CiGAS-long gene, which is relevant for breeding the trait into other cultivars. The inactivation of the STL biosynthesis pathway led to increase in phenolic compounds as well as accumulation of squalene in the chicory taproot, presumably due to increased availability of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FFP). These results demonstrate that STLs are not essential for chicory growth and that the inhibition of the STL biosynthesis pathway reduced the STL levels chicory which will facilitate inulin extraction.},

This study describes a synthetic biology approach for β-ionone production from glucose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is partially based on polycistronic expression. Experiments with model proteins showed that the T2A sequence of the Thosea asigna virus mediated efficient production of individual proteins from a single transcript in S. cerevisiae. Subsequently, three β-carotene biosynthesis genes from the carotenoid-producing ascomycete Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (crtI, crtE and crtYB) were expressed in S. cerevisiae from a single polycistronic construct. In this construct, the individual crt proteins were separated by T2A sequences. Production of the individual proteins from the polycistronic construct was confirmed by Western blot analysis and by measuring the production of β-carotene. To enable β-ionone production, a carotenoid-cleavage dioxygenase from raspberry (RiCCD1) was co-expressed in the β-carotene producing strain. In glucose-grown cultures with a second phase of dodecane, β-ionone and geranylacetone accumulated in the organic phase. Thus, by introducing a polycistronic construct encoding a fungal carotenoid pathway and an expression cassette encoding a plant dioxygenase, a novel microbial production system has been established for a fruit flavour compound.},

  abstract = {Tobacco BY-2 cells have emerged as a promising platform for the manufacture of biopharmaceutical proteins, offering efficient protein secretion, favourable growth characteristics and cultivation in containment under a controlled environment. The cultivation of BY-2 cells in disposable bioreactors is a useful alternative to conventional stainless steel stirred-tank reactors, and orbitally-shaken bioreactors could provide further advantages such as simple bag geometry, scalability and predictable process settings. We carried out a scale-up study, using a 200-L orbitally-shaken bioreactor holding disposable bags, and BY-2 cells producing the human monoclonal antibody M12. We found that cell growth and recombinant protein accumulation were comparable to standard shake flask cultivation, despite a 200-fold difference in cultivation volume. Final cell fresh weights of 300-387 g/L and M12 yields of ∼20 mg/L were achieved with both cultivation methods. Furthermore, we established an efficient downstream process for the recovery of M12 from the culture broth. The viscous spent medium prevented clarification using filtration devices, but we used expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography with SP Sepharose as an alternative for the efficient capture of the M12 antibody. EBA was introduced as an initial purification step prior to protein A affinity chromatography, resulting in an overall M12 recovery of 75-85% and a purity of >95%. Our results demonstrate the suitability of orbitally-shaken bioreactors for the scaled-up cultivation of plant cell suspension cultures and provide a strategy for the efficient purification of antibodies from the BY-2 culture medium.},

  abstract = {The unique features of IgA, such as the ability to recruit neutrophils and suppress the inflammatory responses mediated by IgG and IgE, make it a promising antibody isotype for several therapeutic applications. However, in contrast to IgG, reports on plant production of IgA are scarce. We produced IgA1κ and IgG1κ versions of three therapeutic antibodies directed against pro-inflammatory cytokines in Nicotiana benthamiana: Infliximab and Adalimumab, directed against TNF-α, and Ustekinumab, directed against the interleukin-12p40 subunit. We evaluated antibody yield, quality and N-glycosylation. All six antibodies had comparable levels of expression between 3.5 and 9% of total soluble protein content and were shown to have neutralizing activity in a cell-based assay. However, IgA1κ-based Adalimumab and Ustekinumab were poorly secreted compared to their IgG counterparts. Infliximab was poorly secreted regardless of isotype backbone. This corresponded with the observation that both IgA1κ- and IgG1κ-based Infliximab were enriched in oligomannose-type N-glycan structures. For IgG1κ-based Ustekinumab and Adalimumab, the major N-glycan type was the typical plant complex N-glycan, biantennary with terminal N-acetylglucosamine, β1,2-xylose and core α1,3-fucose. In contrast, the major N-glycan on the IgA-based antibodies was xylosylated, but lacked core α1,3-fucose and one terminal N-acetylglucosamine. This type of N-glycan occurs usually in marginal percentages in plants and was never shown to be the main fraction of a plant-produced recombinant protein. Our data demonstrate that the antibody isotype may have a profound influence on the type of N-glycan an antibody receives.},

These small molecules have shown several health benefits for various diseases, including brain disorders. However, it is unknown whether these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and which could be the effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. We show that six sesquiterpene lactones evaluated in an in vitro model of the BBB have different capacities to be transported through the barrier. Costunolide presented more than 20 % of transport while lactucin, 11β-13-dihydrolactucin, 11β-13-dihydrolactucopicrin, and parthenolide presented between 10 % and 20 %, whilst almost no transport was detected for lactucopicrin. Furthermore, costunolide and parthenolide reduced P-gp ABC transporter expression alongside an increase in caveolin-1, the main protein of caveolae. Remarkably, these two compounds improved barrier tightness by increasing the expression of both tight and adherens junctions. These findings open a new avenue to explore costunolide and parthenolide as promising compounds for brain therapies.},

ROS1 and DEL form a pair of well-characterized TFs from Snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), which specifically induce anthocyanin accumulation when expressed in tomato fruit. In N. benthamiana, robust induction of a single anthocyanin, delphinidin-3-rutinoside (D3R) was observed after expression of both ROS1 and DEL. Surprisingly in addition to D3R, a range of additional metabolites were also strongly and specifically up-regulated upon expression of ROS1 and DEL. Except for the D3R, these induced compounds were not derived from the flavonoid pathway. Most notable among these are nornicotine conjugates with butanoyl, hexanoyl, and octanoyl hydrophobic moieties, and phenylpropanoid-polyamine conjugates such as caffeoyl putrescine. The defensive properties of the induced molecules were addressed in bioassays using the tobacco specialist lepidopteran insect Manduca sexta. Our study showed that the effect of ROS1 and DEL expression in N. benthamiana leaves extends beyond the flavonoid pathway. Apparently the same transcription factor may regulate different secondary metabolite pathways in different plant species.},

To address these challenges, we used a design of experiments approach to develop an optimized induction protocol for the cultivation of tobacco hairy roots secreting the full-size monoclonal antibody M12. The antibody yield was enhanced 30-fold by the addition of 14 g/L KNO3 , 19 mg/L 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 1.5 g/L of the stabilizing agent polyvinylpyrrolidone. Analysis of hairy root cross sections revealed that the optimized medium induced lateral root formation and morphological changes in the inner cortex and pericycle cells, indicating that the improved productivity was at least partially based on the enhanced efficiency of antibody secretion. We found that 57% of the antibody was secreted, yielding 5.9 mg of product per liter of induction medium. Both the secreted and intracellular forms of the antibody could be isolated by protein A affinity chromatography and their functionality was confirmed using vitronectin-binding assays. Glycan analysis revealed three major plant complex-type glycans on both forms of the antibody, although the secreted form was more homogeneous due to the predominance of a specific glycoform. Tobacco hairy root cultures therefore offer a practical solution for the production of homogeneous pharmaceutical antibodies in containment.},

It is an oxidized sesquiterpene, which has been postulated to be derived from valencene. Both valencene and nootkatone are used for flavouring citrus beverages and are considered among the most valuable terpenes used at commercial scale. Functional evaluation of putative terpene synthase genes sourced by large-scale EST sequencing from Nootka cypress wood revealed a valencene synthase gene (CnVS). CnVS expression in different tissues from the tree correlates well with nootkatone content, suggesting that CnVS represents the first dedicated gene in the nootkatone biosynthetic pathway in C. nootkatensis The gene belongs to the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily of terpenes synthases and its protein sequence has low similarity to known citrus valencene synthases. In vitro, CnVS displays high robustness under different pH and temperature regimes, potentially beneficial properties for application in different host and physiological conditions. Biotechnological production of sesquiterpenes has been shown to be feasible, but productivity of microbial strains expressing valencene synthase from Citrus is low, indicating that optimization of valencene synthase activity is needed. Indeed, expression of CnVS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated potential for higher yields. In an optimized Rhodobacter sphaeroides strain, expression of CnVS increased valencene yields 14-fold to 352 mg/L, bringing production to levels with industrial potential.},

Two different types of galactosylated N-glycans have initially been reported in plants as the result of expression of human β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (GalT). Here we show that these differences are associated with differences at its N-terminus: the natural short variant of human GalT results in hybrid type N-glycans, whereas the long form generates bi-antennary complex type N-glycans. Furthermore, expression of non-mammalian, chicken and zebrafish GalT homologues with N-termini resembling the short human GalT N-terminus also induce hybrid type N-glycans. Providing both non-mammalian GalTs with a 13 amino acid N-terminal extension that distinguishes the two naturally occurring forms of human GalT, acted to increase the levels of bi-antennary galactosylated N-glycans when expressed in tobacco leaves. Replacement of the cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain of chicken and zebrafish GalTs with the corresponding region of rat α2,6-sialyltransferase yielded a gene whose expression enhanced the level of bi-antennary galactosylation even further.},

In 2006, three lesions in the liver were detected and resected. The three lesions all showed activation of the β-catenin pathway and were histologically characterized by a highly differentiated steatotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with remnants of the underlying adenoma from which it arose, a hepatocellular adenoma with foci of well-differentiated HCC, and a cholestatic adenoma. Risk factors for the emergence of HCC included FA itself, the use of androgens for a period of 3 years preceding HSCT and toxicity of the conditioning regimen. Because of the danger of developing additional HCC, liver transplantation was proposed, taking into consideration that immunosuppression would increase the risk of other malignancies. By using part of the liver of the sister, who already acted as bone marrow donor 13 years earlier, immunosuppression could be avoided. Liver transplantation was performed in 2007 without complication. Five years after liver transplantation the patient is doing well. This case is twofold special being the first case reporting FA co-occurring with Marfan syndrome and being the first reported case of FA treated for HCC by liver transplantation from a HLA-identical sibling donor without the use of immunosuppression.},

Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 825 +/- 49 dynes. s. cm(-5) (U-46619) to 533 +/- 48 dynes. s. cm(-5) (10 ppm NO) (P < 0.05 versus U-46619) and 396 +/- 42 dynes. s. cm(-5) (dipyridamole 10 microg kg-1x min-1 and 10 ppm NO) (P <0.05 versus NO), and cardiac output increased from 1.93 +/- 0.09 L/min to 2.03 +/- 0.13 L/min and 2.60 +/- 0.30 L/min (P < 0.05 versus NO). Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 90 +/- 5 mm Hg (10 ppm NO) to 75 +/- 3 mm Hg (dipyridamole plus 10 ppm NO) (P < 0.01). The pulmonary vasodilation obtained with NO alone could be prolonged from 12 to 42 min when inhaled NO was combined with IV dipyridamole, accounting for a time-weighted reduction in NO exposure by 72%. We conclude that dipyridamole augments the effects of NO on right ventricular afterload, allows for intermittent NO inhalation, and can significantly reduce exposure to NO. IV dipyridamole prolongs the action of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in a piglet model of acute pulmonary hypertension. Intermittent NO inhalation combined with IV dipyridamole decreases pulmonary artery pressure for a prolonged period of time and reduces exposure to NO.},

Liver transplantation (LTx) may be curative, but is usually restricted to patients with mild-to-moderate POPH. The presence of severe POPH may be a contraindication to transplantation because of the elevated risk of peritransplantation and post-transplantation morbidity and mortality. This report describes a series of seven patients with onset of moderate (two patients) or severe (five patients) POPH before LTx, of whom six were treated with oral vasodilator therapy for POPH. Although previous studies recommend aggressive parenteral prostacyclin therapy (epoprostenol), we describe the opportunity to treat cases of severe POPH with an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (sildenafil) and/or an endothelin receptor antagonist (bosentan/ambrisentan) as a bridge to successful LTx in selected patients.},

We investigated whether i.v. dipyridamole, a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, increased the effects of inhaled NO and prevented rebound pulmonary hypertension. In 14 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated piglets, pulmonary hypertension was induced with U-46619, a thromboxane A(2) analogue. Response to NO and rebound pulmonary hypertension were evaluated without and with i.v. dipyridamole. Low-dose dipyridamole (10 micro g/kg/min) increased cardiac output and augmented the effects of inhaled NO on pulmonary vascular resistance, with marginal additive effect on mean pulmonary artery pressure. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 904 to 511 (20 parts per million NO) (p < 0.0005) and 358 dyne s cm(-5) (20 parts per million NO + dipyridamole) (p < 0.001 versus NO alone), and mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 29.0 to 20.5 (p < 0.0001) and 19.3 mm Hg (NS versus NO), respectively. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 85 to 74 mm Hg (dipyridamole + NO) (p < 0.01). High-dose dipyridamole (100 micro g/kg/min) with inhaled NO reduced pulmonary vascular resistance to 334 dyne s cm(-5) but also decreased mean arterial pressure to 57 mm Hg. Eight piglets developed rebound pulmonary hypertension. Two died of acute right ventricular failure and, in five, rebound pulmonary hypertension was prevented by low-dose dipyridamole. In conclusion, low-dose i.v. dipyridamole augments the effects of inhaled NO on right ventricular afterload with moderate changes in systemic hemodynamics, and can prevent rebound pulmonary hypertension.},

  abstract = {Critically ill cirrhotic patients are increasingly transplanted, but there is no consensus about futile liver transplantation (LT). Therefore, the decision to delay or deny LT is often extensively debated. These debates arise from different opinions of futility among transplant team members. This study aims to achieve a multinational and multidisciplinary consensus on the definition of futility in LT and to develop well-articulated criteria for not proceeding with LT due to futility. Thirty-five international experts from anesthesiology/intensive care, hepatology, and transplant surgery were surveyed using the Delphi method. More than 70% of similar answers to a question were necessary to define agreement. The panel recommended patient and graft survival at 1 year after LT to define futility. Severe frailty and persistent fever or <72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy in case of ongoing sepsis were considered reasons to delay LT. A simple assessment of the number of organs failing was considered the most appropriate way to decide whether LT should be delayed or denied, with respiratory, circulatory and metabolic failures having the most influence in this decision. The thresholds of severity of organ failures contraindicating LT for which a consensus was achieved were a Pao2/FiO2 ratio<150 mm Hg, a norepinephrine dose >1 μg/kg per minute and a serum lactate level >9 mmol/L. Our expert panel provides a consensus on the definition of futile LT and on specific criteria for postponing or denying LT. A framework that may facilitate the decision if a patient is too sick for transplant is presented.},

A consensus was reached among experts after the second round. Patients should be screened for malnutrition and treated whenever possible. Prophylactic nasogastric intubation and prophylactic abdominal drainage may be omitted, and early extubation should be considered. Early oral intake, mobilization, and multimodal-balanced analgesia are recommended.

The level of evidence and strength of recommendation were judged according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation system. Diagnosis of AKI should be based on the KDIGO criteria. The preoperative risk factors are more related to the patient's predisposing factors and post-operative risk factors tend to be difficult to control. Therefore, focusing on intra-operative risk factors it would be important to maintain an adequate hemodynamics and to keep inferior vena cava clamping as short as possible. Biomarkers to identify AKI at an early stage are available; however, there is a lack of robust data that indicates their true beneficial effect. Intraoperative renal replacement therapy may be beneficial in some selective cases whereas its postoperative timing is still under debate. Perioperative liver transplant risk factors for acute kidney injury are difficult to control. Therefore, the focus should be on intra-operative hemodynamics and nephrotoxic drugs avoidance. Prospective randomized trials are needed to show the beneficial effect of early replacement therapy. In this context, the new biomarkers would be helpful in identifying kidney injury earlier.},

The overall conversion rate was 17/265 (6.4%), equally distributed over the period of the study. Statistically significant factors for conversion were found to be LLR of the postero-superior (P-S) segments (SI, SIVa; SVII; SVIII) (12.7% converted versus 2.5% non-converted groups, P = 0.01) and a major compared with a minor hepatectomy (15.2% vs. 4.6%, P = 0.02 respectively). A R0 resection was achieved in 93.2% of cases. According to Dindo's classification, complications were recorded as grade I (n = 20); grade II (6); grade III (11) and grade IV(1) events (total morbidity rate of 14%). Univariate analysis identified a major hepatectomy and resection involving P-S segments as prognostic factors for conversion whereas multivariate analysis identified the latter as an independent risk factor [P = 0.003, odds ratio (OR) = 5.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-18.8]. LLR can be safely performed with low overall morbidity. According to this experience and irrespective of the learning curve, resections of P-S segments were identified as an independent risk factor for conversion in LLR.},

We demonstrated in the past that volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver resection. In this randomized study, we examined if volatile anesthetics have an effect on acute graft injury and clinical outcomes after liver transplantation. Cadaveric liver transplant recipients were enrolled from January 2009 to September 2012 at 3 University Centers (Zurich/Sao Paulo/Ghent). Recipients were randomly assigned to propofol (control group) or sevoflurane anesthesia. Postoperative peak of aspartate transaminase was defined as primary endpoint, secondary endpoints were early allograft dysfunction, in-hospital complications, intensive care unit, and hospital stay. Ninety-eight recipients were randomized to propofol (n = 48) or sevoflurane (n = 50). Median peak aspartate transaminase after transplantation was 925 (interquartile range, 512-3274) in the propofol and 1097 (interquartile range, 540-2633) in the sevoflurane group. In the propofol arm, 11 patients (23%) experienced early allograft dysfunction, 7 (14%) in the sevoflurane one (odds ratio, 0.64 (0.20 to 2.02, P = 0.45). There were 4 mortalities (8.3%) in the propofol and 2 (4.0%) in the sevoflurane group. Overall and major complication rates were not different. An effect on clinical outcomes was observed favoring the sevoflurane group (less severe complications), but without significance. This first multicenter trial comparing propofol with sevoflurane anesthesia in liver transplantation shows no difference in biochemical markers of acute organ injury and clinical outcomes between the 2 regimens. Sevoflurane has no significant added beneficial effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury compared to propofol.},

Because POPH is frequently asymptomatic, screening with echocardiography is recommended. The only reliable technique, however, for diagnosing POPH is right heart catheterization (RHC). The aims of this study were to evaluate the current estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) cutoff value of 30 mm Hg and to determine a better cutoff value. One hundred fifty-two patients underwent pretransplant echocardiography between January 2005 and December 2010. These echocardiographic results were compared with pulmonary artery pressures measured during the pretransplant workup or at the beginning of the transplantation procedure (both by catheterization). With a cutoff value of 30 mm Hg, 74 of the 152 patients met the criteria for POPH on echocardiography, although the diagnosis was confirmed in only 7 patients during catheterization; this resulted in a specificity of 54%. It would have been more accurate to use a cutoff value of 38 mm Hg, which had a maximal specificity of 82% and, at the same time, guaranteed a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%. With the incorporation of the presence or absence of right ventricular dilatation, the specificity even increased to 93% for this new cutoff value. In conclusion, the prevalence of POPH was 4.6% among LT candidates in this study. We can recommend that LT candidates with an sPAP > 38 mm Hg should be referred for RHC. With the cutoff value increased from 30 to 38 mm Hg, the number of patients undergoing invasive RHC during their evaluation could be safely reduced.},

This group was retrospectively compared with a historical cohort of patients treated by the Lichtenstein technique. Our policy concerning type of anaesthesia, post-operative pain management and visual analogue scale measurements did not change over the study period. For post-operative pain evaluation, the visual analogue scale was used (0-10) and scores were measured after 6 h, 24 h, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year and yearly thereafter. Recurrence rates were evaluated at time of clinical examinations. In total, 142 patients have been analysed with the TIPP technique (group I) versus 136 patients operated in the previous 2 years with a Lichtenstein repair (group II). In group I, 112 patients (78.9%) received a medium size patch of 14 x 7.5 cm and 30 patients (21.1%) had a large patch (16 x 9 cm). The mean operative time for a TIPP procedure was statistically shorter than for a Lichtenstein repair, 33 versus 44 min, respectively (p = 0.04). After 24 h, 1 week and 1 month post-surgery, there was significantly less post-operative pain observed in the TIPP group than in the Lichtenstein group. In total, four recurrences were observed in the TIPP group (2.8%), of which one laterally and three medially. In group II, seven recurrences were observed in total (5.1%), of which five were detected within 2 years of follow-up (3.7%). For surgeons performing the Lichtenstein repair but looking for modifications concerning pain relief and a quicker procedure, the TIPP approach is a feasible alternative that seems to be associated with less post-operative pain.},

The surfactant is shown to bind and compact DNA efficiently, and structural studies and calculations provide a working picture of the "lipoplex" formed. The lipoplex can penetrate the outer membranes of many cell types, to appear in the cytoplasm encapsulated within endosomes. Escape from the endosome--a key step for transfection--may be controlled by changes in the aggregation behavior of the lipoplex as the pH falls. The evidence suggests that DNA may be released from the lipoplex before entry into the nucleus, where the new gene can be expressed with high efficiency.},

Uniquely, three well-defined morphologies of the lipoplex were observed upon gradual acidification: a lamellar phase, a condensed lamellar phase, and an inverted hexagonal (H(II)) columnar phase. Using molecular modeling, we link the observed lipoplex morphologies and physical behavior to specific structural features in the individual surfactant, illuminating key factors in future surfactant design, viz., a spacer of six methylene groups, the presence of two nitrogens that can be protonated in the physiological pH range, two unsaturated alkyl tails, and hydrophilic sugar headgroups. Assuming that the mechanism of transfection by synthetic cationic surfactants involves endocytosis, we contend that the efficacy of gemini surfactant 1 as a gene delivery vehicle can be explained by the unprecedented observation of a pH-induced formation of the inverted hexagonal phase of the lipoplex in the endosomal pH range. This change in morphology leads to destabilization of the endosome through fusion of the lipoplex with the endosomal wall, resulting in release of DNA into the cytoplasm.},

  abstract = {Surgery for refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal hernia leads to recurrence or persisting dysphagia in a minority of patients. Redo antireflux surgery in GERD and hiatal hernia is known for higher morbidity and mortality. This study aims to evaluate conventional versus robot-assisted laparoscopic redo antireflux surgery, with the objective to detect possible advantages for the robot-assisted approach. A single institute cohort of 75 patients who underwent either conventional laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic redo surgery for recurrent GERD or severe dysphagia between 2008 and 2013 were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, medical history, procedural data, hospital stay, complications and outcome were prospectively gathered. The main indications for redo surgery were dysphagia, pyrosis or a combination of both in combination with a proven anatomic abnormality. The mean time to redo surgery was 1.9 and 2.0 years after primary surgery for the conventional and robot-assisted groups, respectively. The number of conversions was lower in the robot-assisted group compared to conventional laparoscopy (1/45 vs. 5/30, p = 0.035) despite a higher proportion of patients with previous surgery by laparotomy (9/45 vs. 1/30, p = 0.038). Median hospital stay was reduced by 1 day (3 vs. 4, p = 0.042). There were no differences in mortality, complications or outcome. Robotic support, when available, can be regarded beneficial in redo surgery for GERD and hiatal hernia. Results of this observational study suggest technical feasibility for minimal-invasive robot-assisted redo surgery after open primary antireflux surgery, a reduced number of conversions and shorter hospital stay.},

  abstract = {Microcirculatory alterations have been associated with morbidity and mortality in human sepsis. Such alterations occur despite pressure-guided resuscitation. Earlier data suggested that impaired microcirculatory blood flow could be corrected with intravenous nitroglycerin in these patients. We tested this concept after fulfillment of preset systemic hemodynamic resuscitation end points in the early phase of sepsis. Prospective, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Closed-format 22-bed mixed intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients > or =18 yrs with sepsis, according to international criteria, and at least one early sign of organ dysfunction, as the principal reason for intensive care unit admission, were eligible for enrollment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive nitroglycerin (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35) after fulfillment of protocol-driven resuscitation end points. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00493415. Primary outcome was sublingual microcirculatory blood flow of small vessels, as assessed by side-stream dark field imaging. After protocolized resuscitation, we observed recruitment of sublingual microcirculation in both groups, as indicated by a significant improvement in the microcirculatory flow index after 24 hrs, in comparison to baseline. However, no difference in the sublingual microvascular flow index was observed between groups. The median microvascular flow index in sublingual small-sized vessels was 2.71 (1.85-3) in the nitroglycerin group and 2.71 (1.27-3), p = .80, in the placebo group. In medium-sized vessels, the respective values were 3 (2.75-3) vs. 2.86 (2.19-3), p = .21, and in large-sized vessels, 3 (3-3) vs. 3 (2.89-3), p = .06. In-hospital mortality, as a secondary outcome, was 34.3% in the nitroglycerin group and 14.2% in the placebo group, p = .09. In the context of a strict resuscitation protocol, based upon fulfillment of systemic hemodynamic end points in patients with early-phase severe sepsis or septic shock, we conclude that intravenous nitroglycerin does not promote sublingual microcirculatory blood flow.},

  abstract = {The use of regional anaesthesia has increased and evolved over the past two decades but to what extent is unclear. Moreover, there is no clear standardisation of best practice in the current European landscape, which could result in inconsistencies in regional anaesthesia in practice. The objective of this survey was to explore regional anaesthesia practices across Europe, including the differences in procedures, use of ultrasound, reporting of complications, guidelines, training and patient safety implementation. A Faculty of European regional anaesthesia experts developed a survey of 27 questions focused on respondent and institution profile, anaesthesia services, patient and safety management, training, use of guidelines, and the implementation of NRFit The survey was disseminated across several European countries via professional networks. There were 794 respondents from 36 European countries. The survey demonstrated that use of regional anaesthesia is growing in Europe and is supported by new technologies. Although some results are consistent with expected trends and applications (e.g. procedures predominantly performed by anaesthesiologists), there are inconsistencies in practice across European countries, especially in the specific regional anaesthesia procedures utilised for different clinical applications and the recording and reporting of regional anaesthesia complications. These inconsistencies also extended to which guidelines are primarily followed and how training is implemented. There were also variations in the general awareness and uptake of the ISO standard for NRFit. The survey results highlight a clear need for standardisation and consistency in the use and management of regional anaesthesia across Europe. The faculty put forth several calls to action that could provide major steps in the right direction towards meeting that goal, including the establishment of European best practices, development of a complication reporting system and implementation of educational programmes to highlight the importance of NRFit.},
