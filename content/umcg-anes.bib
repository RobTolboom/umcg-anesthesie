  abstract = {Intraspinal dermoid and epidermoid tumors are two histopathological subtypes of cutaneous inclusion tumors of the spine. This classification is based on obsolete embryological knowledge. In fact, according to current embryology, both tumor types consist of ectodermal derivatives. Therefore, we hypothesized that dermoid and epidermoid tumors do not differ in clinical practice. To explore this hypothesis, we studied the clinical, radiological and intraoperative findings of 18 patients, and related these findings to the histopathological characteristics of the tumor. No differences were found between dermoid and epidermoid tumors regarding clinical presentation, radiological examination and outcome, while intraoperative diagnosis by the surgeon correlated with the histopathological diagnosis in only 8 of 18 cases. Therefore, the histopathological difference between intraspinal dermoid and epidermoid tumors is not important in clinical practice and should be avoided. A new nomenclature is proposed in which both tumor types are referred to as 'spinal cutaneous inclusion tumors'.},

  abstract = {We present a method that significantly enhances the robustness of (automated) NMR structure determination by allowing the NOE data corresponding to unassigned NMR resonances to be used directly in the calculations. The unassigned resonances are represented by additional atoms or groups of atoms that have no interaction with the regular protein atoms except through distance restraints. These so-called "proxy" residues can be used to generate NOE-based distance restraints in a similar fashion as for the assigned part of the protein. If sufficient NOE information is available, the restraints are expected to place the proxies at positions close to the correct atoms for the unassigned resonance, which can facilitate subsequent assignment. Convergence can be further improved by supplying additional information about the possible identities of the unassigned resonances. We have implemented this approach in the widely used automated assignment and structure calculation protocols ARIA and CANDID. We find that it significantly increases the robustness of structure calculations with regard to missing assignments and yields structures of higher quality. Our approach is still able to find correctly folded structures with up to 30% randomly missing resonance assignments, and even when only backbone and beta resonances are present! This should be of significant value to NMR-based structural proteomics initiatives.},

Because the carriers comprise a small fraction of the total charge density and may be rapidly fluctuating, modulations are difficult to detect directly. We demonstrate that in anomalous x-ray scattering at the oxygen K edge of the cuprates, the contribution of carriers to the scattering amplitude is selectively magnified 82 times. This enhances diffraction from the doped holes by more than 10(3), permitting direct structural analysis of the superconducting ground state. Scattering from thin films of La2CuO4+delta (superconducting transition temperature = 39 K) at temperature = 50 +/- 5 kelvin on the reciprocal space intervals (0,0,0.21) --> (0,0,1.21) and (0,0,0.6) --> (0.3,0,0.6) shows a rounding of the carrier density near the substrate suggestive of a depletion zone or similar effect. The structure factor for off-specular scattering was less than 3 x 10(-7) electrons, suggesting an absence of in-plane hole ordering in this material.},

One candidate is the 'stripe' phase, in which the charge carriers (holes) condense into rivers of charge that separate regions of antiferromagnetism. A related but lesser known system is the 'spin ladder', which consists of two coupled chains of magnetic ions forming an array of rungs. A doped ladder can be thought of as a high-T(c) material with lower dimensionality, and has been predicted to exhibit both superconductivity and an insulating 'hole crystal' phase in which the carriers are localized through many-body interactions. The competition between the two resembles that believed to operate between stripes and superconductivity in high-T(c) materials. Here we report the existence of a hole crystal in the doped spin ladder of Sr14Cu24O41 using a resonant X-ray scattering technique. This phase exists without a detectable distortion in the structural lattice, indicating that it arises from many-body electronic effects. Our measurements confirm theoretical predictions, and support the picture that proximity to charge ordered states is a general property of superconductivity in copper oxides.},

We investigate if this relates to changes in cortical excitation-inhibition balance, which has been observed to be atypical in schizophrenia, by combining electroencephalography and computational modeling. Our electroencephalography task results, for which the local field potentials can be used as a proxy, show lower signal-to-noise ratio due to higher noise in schizophrenia. Both electroencephalography rest and task states exhibit higher levels of excitation in the functional excitation-inhibition (as a proxy of excitation-inhibition balance). This suggests a relationship between increased noise and atypical excitation in schizophrenia, which was addressed by using computational modeling. A Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model was used to simulate the effects of varying degrees of noise on excitation-inhibition balance, local field potential, NMDA current, and . Results show a noise-related increase in the local field potential, excitation in excitation-inhibition balance, pyramidal NMDA current, and spike rate. Mutual information and mediation analysis were used to explore a cross-level relationship, showing that the cortical local field potential plays a key role in transferring the effect of noise to the cellular population level of NMDA.},

It is unclear whether epigenetic changes play a mediatory role in the associations between these lifestyle factors and T2DM. We assessed the associations between a comprehensive lifestyle index, DNA methylation and T2DM among Ghanaian adults. We used whole-blood Illumina 450 k DNA methylation data from 713 Ghanaians from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. We constructed a comprehensive lifestyle index based on established cut-offs for diet quality, physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking status. In the T2DM-free discovery cohort (n = 457), linear models were fitted to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with the lifestyle index after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and technical covariates. Associations between the identified DMPs and the primary outcome (T2DM), as well as secondary outcomes (fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c), were determined via logistic and linear regression models, respectively. In the present study population (mean age: 52 ± 10 years; male: 42.6%), the comprehensive lifestyle index showed a significant association with one DMP annotated to an intergenic region on chromosome 7 (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.024). Others were annotated to ADCY7, SMARCE1, AHRR, LOXL2, and PTBP1 genes. One DMR was identified and annotated to the GFPT2 gene (familywise error rate (FWER) from bumphunter bootstrap = 0.036). None of the DMPs showed significant associations with T2DM; directions of effect were positive for the DMP in the AHRR and inverse for all the other DMPs. Higher methylation of the ADCY7 DMP was associated with higher FBG (p = 0.024); LOXL2 DMP was associated with lower FBG (p = 0.023) and HbA1c (p = 0.049); and PTBP1 DMP was associated with lower HbA1c (p = 0.002). In this explorative epigenome-wide association study among Ghanaians, we identified one DMP and DMR associated with a comprehensive lifestyle index not previously associated with individual lifestyle factors. Based on our findings, we infer that lifestyle factors in combination, affect DNA methylation, thereby influencing the risk of T2DM among Ghanaian adults living in different contexts.},

An invasive pharmacologic strategy could offer an alternative treatment for these patients. We aimed to establish whether prognosis was better with primary angioplasty or fibrinolysis for reperfusion in cases of STEMI occurring far from a catheterization laboratory. Prospective registry study of patients with STEMI admitted to our cardiology critical care unit. Patients were included over a 5-year period if they received reperfusion therapy and had required transport of more than 50 km to reach a hospital with a catheterization laboratory. We recorded characteristics of the STEMI event, treatment times, and short- and long-term mortality. The data was used for survival analysis. We registered 584 patients; 194 were treated with primary angioplasty and 390 with fibrinolysis. The mean time between first physician contact and balloon insertion was 160 minutes. The mean time between first physician contact and needle insertion for fibrinolysis was 30 minutes. The 2-year mortality rate was higher in patients treated with angioplasty (12.2%) than with those who underwent fibrinolysis (7.0%) ) (P=.04). Survival analysis showed that risk for death was higher in the primary angioplasty group (hazard ratio, 1.97 (95% CI, 0.64-0.95; P=.001). When STEMI occurs more than 50 km from a catheterization laboratory, reperfusion by means of balloon angioplasty delays care considerably and is associated with a higher mortality rate than reperfusion by fibrinolysis.},

Nanoporous zirconia specimens demonstrated comparable alkaline phosphatase activity (0.0036 ± 0.0035 ng/μl) and intracellular protein content (72.7 ± 0.9 ng/μl) compared to other tested groups. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that cells attached on the polished surface using finger-like processes, whereas on the nanoporous surface, finger-like processes were not observed, as the cell membrane appeared to be in close proximity to the underlying surface. The findings of this study suggest that a nanoporous zirconia surface favors cell growth and attachment compared to a polished surface.

However, quantitative estimates of various disturbance characteristics required in management applications are rare in longer-term historical studies. Thus, our objectives were to (1) quantify past disturbance severity, patch size, and stand proportion disturbed and (2) test for temporal and subregional differences in these characteristics. We developed a comprehensive dendrochronological method to evaluate an approximately two-century-long disturbance record in the remaining Central and Eastern European primary mountain spruce forests, where wind and bark beetles are the predominant disturbance agents. We used an unprecedented large-scale nested design data set of 541 plots located within 44 stands and 6 subregions. To quantify individual disturbance events, we used tree-ring proxies, which were aggregated at plot and stand levels by smoothing and detecting peaks in their distributions. The spatial aggregation of disturbance events was used to estimate patch sizes. Data exhibited continuous gradients from low- to high-severity and small- to large-size disturbance events. In addition to the importance of small disturbance events, moderate-scale (25-75% of the stand disturbed, >10 ha patch size) and moderate-severity (25-75% of canopy disturbed) events were also common. Moderate disturbances represented more than 50% of the total disturbed area and their rotation periods ranged from one to several hundred years, which is within the lifespan of local tree species. Disturbance severities differed among subregions, whereas the stand proportion disturbed varied significantly over time. This indicates partially independent variations among disturbance characteristics. Our quantitative estimates of disturbance severity, patch size, stand proportion disturbed, and associated rotation periods provide rigorous baseline data for future ecological research, decisions within biodiversity conservation, and silviculture intended to maintain native biodiversity and ecosystem functions. These results highlight a need for sufficiently large and adequately connected networks of strict reserves, more complex silvicultural treatments that emulate the natural disturbance spectrum in harvest rotation times, sizes, and intensities, and higher levels of tree and structural legacy retention.},

  abstract = {The drift in radiofrequency (RF) power amplifiers (RFPAs) is assessed and several contributing factors are investigated. Two approaches for prospective correction of drift are proposed and their effectiveness is evaluated. RFPA drift assessment encompasses both intra-pulse and inter-pulse drift analyses. Scan protocols with varying flip angle (FA), RF length, and pulse repetition time (TR) are used to gauge the influence of these parameters on drift. Directional couplers (DICOs) monitor the forward waveforms of the RFPA outputs. DICOs data is stored for evaluation, allowing calculation of correction factors to adjust RFPAs' transmit voltage. Two correction methods, predictive and run-time, are employed: predictive correction necessitates a calibration scan, while run-time correction calculates factors during the ongoing scan. RFPA drift is indeed influenced by the RF duty-cycle, and in the cases examined with a maximum duty-cycle of 66%, the potential drift is approximately 41% or 15%, depending on the specific RFPA revision. Notably, in low transmit voltage scenarios, FA has minimal impact on RFPA drift. The application of predictive and run-time drift correction techniques effectively reduces the average drift from 10.0% to less than 1%, resulting in enhanced MR signal stability. Utilizing DICO recordings and implementing a feedback mechanism enable the prospective correction of RFPA drift. Having a calibration scan, predictive correction can be utilized with fewer complexity; for enhanced performance, a run-time approach can be employed.},

  abstract = {For many years, researchers have been making efforts to find a manufacturing technique, as well as a drug delivery system, that will allow for oral delivery of biopharmaceuticals to their target site of action without impairing their biological activity. Due to the positive in vivo outcomes of this formulation strategy, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDSs) have been intensively studied in the last few years as a way of overcoming the different challenges associated with the oral delivery of macromolecules. The purpose of the present study was to examine the possibility of developing solid SEDDSs as potential carriers for the oral delivery of lysozyme (LYS) using the Quality by Design (QbD) concept. LYS was successfully ion paired with anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), and this complex was incorporated into a previously developed and optimized liquid SEDDS formulation comprising medium-chain triglycerides, polysorbate 80, and PEG 400. The final formulation of a liquid SEDDS carrying the LYS:SDS complex showed satisfactory in vitro characteristics as well as self-emulsifying properties (droplet size: 13.02 nm, PDI: 0.245, and zeta potential: -4.85 mV). The obtained nanoemulsions were robust to dilution in the different media and highly stable after 7 days, with a minor increase in droplet size (13.84 nm) and constant negative zeta potential (-0.49 mV). An optimized liquid SEDDS loaded with the LYS:SDS complex was further solidified into powders by adsorption onto a chosen solid carrier, followed by direct compression into self-emulsifying tablets. Solid SEDDS formulations also exhibited acceptable in vitro characteristics, while LYS preserved its therapeutic activity in all phases of the development process. On the basis of the results gathered, loading the hydrophobic ion pairs of therapeutic proteins and peptides to solid SEDDS may serve as a potential method for delivering biopharmaceuticals orally.},

  abstract = {Progressive neurocognitive dysfunction is the leading cause of a reduced quality of life in patients with primary brain tumors. Understanding how the human brain responds to cancer and its treatment is essential to improve the associated cognitive sequelae. In this study, we performed integrated transcriptomic and tissue analysis on postmortem normal-appearing non-tumor brain tissue from glioblastoma (GBM) patients that had received cancer treatments, region-matched brain tissue from unaffected control individuals and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We show that normal-appearing non-tumor brain regions of patients with GBM display hallmarks of accelerated aging, in particular mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and proteostasis deregulation. The extent and spatial pattern of this response decreased with distance from the tumor. Gene set enrichment analyses and a direct comparative analysis with an independent cohort of brain tissue samples from AD patients revealed a significant overlap in differentially expressed genes and a similar biological aging trajectory. Additionally, these responses were validated at the protein level showing the presence of increased lysosomal lipofuscin, phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein Tau, and oxidative DNA damage in normal-appearing brain areas of GBM patients. Overall, our data show that the brain of GBM patients undergoes accelerated aging and shared AD-like features, providing the basis for novel or repurposed therapeutic targets for managing brain tumor-related side effects.},

These findings suggest that the lower bilirubin binding capacity of serum from newborns as compared with serum from adults is a result of both an intrinsic deficiency in binding capacity of neonatal albumin and the presence of substances in neonatal serum that interfere with bilirubin binding.},

Initiation of venoarterial ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) during resuscitation might improve outcomes if used in time and in a selected patient category. However, previous studies have failed to significantly reduce the time from cardiac arrest to ECMO flow to less than 60 min. We hypothesize that the initiation of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) by a Helicopter Emergency Medical Services System (HEMS) will reduce the low flow time and improve outcomes in refractory Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) patients. The ON-SCENE study will use a non-randomised stepped wedge design to implement ECPR in patients with witnessed OHCA between the ages of 18-50 years old, with an initial presentation of shockable rhythm or pulseless electrical activity with a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism, lasting more than 20, but less than 45 min. Patients will be treated by the ambulance crew and HEMS with prehospital ECPR capabilities and will be compared with treatment by ambulance crew and HEMS without prehospital ECPR capabilities. The primary outcome measure will be survival at hospital discharge. The secondary outcome measure will be good neurological outcome defined as a cerebral performance categories scale score of 1 or 2 at 6 and 12 months. The ON-SCENE study focuses on initiating ECPR at the scene of OHCA using HEMS. The current in-hospital ECPR for OHCA obstacles encompassing low survival rates in refractory arrests, extended low-flow durations during transportation, and the critical time sensitivity of initiating ECPR, which could potentially be addressed through the implementation of the HEMS system. When successful, implementing on-scene ECPR could significantly enhance survival rates and minimize neurological impairment.

A tailored counselling programme covering both the period of the rehabilitation treatment and the first months at home seems on the average effective. However, a considerable variation in response is observed in the sense that some patients show a relevant beneficial response while others show no or only a small response on physical activity behaviour. The Rehabilitation, Sports and Active lifestyle (ReSpAct) study aims to estimate the associations of patient and programme characteristics with patients' physical activity behaviour after their participation in a tailored counselling programme. A questionnaire-based nationwide longitudinal prospective cohort study is conducted. Participants are recruited from 18 rehabilitation centres and hospitals in The Netherlands. 2000 participants with a physical disability or chronic disease will be followed during and after their participation in a tailored counselling programme. Programme outcomes on physical activity behaviour and patient as well as programme characteristics that may be associated with differences in physical activity behaviour after programme completion are being assessed. Data collection takes place at baseline and 14, 33 and 52 weeks after discharge from rehabilitation. The study protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the University Medical Centre Groningen and at individual participating institutions. All participants give written informed consent. The study results will provide new insights into factors that may help explain the differences in physical activity behaviour of patients with a physical disability after they have participated in the same physical activity and sports stimulation programme. Thereby, it will support healthcare professionals to tailor their guidance and care to individual patients in order to stimulate physical activity after discharge in a more efficient and effective way.

A standardized calvaria implantation model was applied for 2, 8, and 16 weeks on Wistar rats to test the interactions between the barrier membrane and the underlying bone defects which were filled with bovine bone substitute materials (BSM). In an effort to understand the barrier membrane's bioactivity, deeper histochemical analyses, as well as the immunohistochemical detection of macrophage subtypes (M1/M2) and vascular endothelial cells, were conducted and combined with histomorphometric and statistical approaches. The native collagen-based membrane was found to have ossified due to its potentially osteoconductive and osteogenic properties, forming a "bony shield" overlying the bone defects. Histomorphometrical evaluation revealed the resorption of the membranes and their substitution with bone matrix. The numbers of both M1- and M2-macrophages were significantly higher within the membrane compartments compared to the underlying bone defects. Thereby, M2-macrophages significantly dominated the tissue reaction within the membrane compartments. Statistically, a correlation between M2-macropahges and bone regeneration was only found at 2 weeks post implantationem, while the pro-inflammatory limb of the immune response correlated with the two processes at 8 weeks. Altogether, this study elaborates on the increasingly described correlations between barrier membranes and the underlying bone regeneration, which sheds a light on the understanding of the immunomodulatory features of biomaterials.},

Only two herders are currently listed on the United States' National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan or National Contingency Plan product schedule for potential use in spill response: the surface collecting agents Siltech OP-40™ and ThickSlick 6535™. Toxicity data for spill response agents are frequently available only for two estuarine species, mysid shrimp (Americamysis bahia) and inland silversides (Menidia beryllina), and are particularly limited for herding agents. Toxicity can vary over several orders of magnitude across product type and species, even within specific categories of spill response agents. Seven aquatic species were tested with both Siltech OP-40™ and ThickSlick 6535™ to evaluate acute herder toxicity and relative species sensitivity. The toxicity assessment included: acute tests with A. bahia and M. beryllina, the freshwater crustacean Ceriodaphina dubia, and the freshwater fish Pimephales promelas; development of the echinoderm Arbacia unctulate; and growth of a freshwater alga Raphidocelis subcapitata and marine alga Dunaliella tertiolecta. Siltech acute toxicity values ranged from 1.1 to 32.8 ppm. ThickSlick acute toxicity values ranged from 2.2 to 126.4 ppm. The results of present study show greater toxicity of Siltech compared to ThickSlick with estimated acute hazard concentrations intended to provide 95% species protection of 1.1 and 3.6 ppm, respectively, on empirical data and 0.64 and 3.3 ppm, respectively, with the addition of interspecies correlation data.

The relative sensitivity of mysids shrimp and inland silversides as surrogate test organisms was determined. Toxicity normalized species sensitivity distributions (SSDn) were used to estimate fifth centile hazard concentration (HC5) values for SWAs with limited toxicity data. Chemical toxicity distributions (CTD) of SWA HC5 values were used to compute a fifth centile chemical hazard distribution (HD5) to provide a more comprehensive assessment of hazard across a spill response product class with limited toxicity data than traditional single species or single agent approaches can give.},

In the present study, we show that βTrCP interacts directly via its WD40 domain with the UbE (ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis) motif in GHR, promoting GHR ubiquitination in vitro. NMR experiments demonstrated that the UbE motif is essentially unstructured, and, together with functional mapping of the UbE and βTrCP WD40 residues necessary for binding, led to a unique interaction model of βTrCP with GHR-UbE. This interaction is different from the conventional βTrCP-substrate interactions described to date. This interaction therefore represents a promising specific target to develop drugs that inhibit GHR endocytosis and increase GH sensitivity in cachexia patients.},

MD simulations unveil temperature-dependent hydration dynamics, with structural transitions marked by changes in the radius of gyration (Rg) and the radial distribution function (RDF), aligning with DFT findings. Our work goes beyond prior studies by combining a DFT, QTAIM and MD simulations approach across different PNIPAM monomer-to-30mer structures. It introduces a systematic quantification of pseudo-saturation thresholds and explores water clustering dynamics with structural specificity, which have not been previously reported in the literature. These novel insights establish a more complete molecular-level picture of PNIPAM hydration behavior and temperature responsiveness, emphasizing the importance of amide hydrogen and carbonyl oxygen sites in hydrogen bonding, which weakens above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), resulting in increased hydrophobicity and paving the way for understanding water sorption mechanisms, offering guidance for future applications such as dehumidification and atmospheric water harvesting.},

In this prospective single-centre study, we included 112 subsequent patients with acute-onset (< 24 h) symptomatic AF. Patients with symptoms of heart failure and ECG signs of ischaemia were excluded. Baseline laboratory measurements, including NT-proBNP, were done. Echocardiograms were performed ~ 2 weeks after restoration of SR. Cardioversion with flecainide was successful in 91 patients (87 %). NT-proBNP was lower in patients with successful cardioversion (P < 0.001). Logistic regression indicated NT-proBNP as an independent predictor of successful cardioversion. A cut-off NT-proBNP value of 1550 pg/ml provided optimal test accuracy to predict successful cardioversion. In patients with < 24 h of symptomatic AF, NT-proBNP levels up to 1550 pg/ml correlate with high success rates (94 %) of cardioversion with flecainide. Conversely, NT-proBNP higher than 1550 pg/ml correlates with poor success rates (36 %).

Retrospective case series. A survey was performed at all large ophthalmological clinics in Switzerland regarding exchanged Lentis LS-502-1 lenses, and the number of affected eyes was counted. Moreover, consecutive patients who were referred to a tertiary clinic between September 2015 and November 2016 with Lentis LS-502-1 opacification were investigated. Peri- and postoperative charts, medical history, and topical and systemic medications were assessed. A total of 674 opacified Lentis LS-502-1 lenses have been reported in Switzerland, and 212 consecutive eyes of 182 patients were included in the study. All IOLs had a similar pattern of opacification with a yellowish, diffuse appearance, and most of them showed a small, paracentral, roundish area that was less affected or not at all. Arterial hypertension (73%), hypercholesterolemia (34%), and diabetes (21%) were the main associated systemic diseases, and statins (34%) and betablockers (34%) were the main treatments used. The prevalence of IOL opacification was 9.9%. No associated systemic eye disease or medications could be detected, which was implicated in the opacification process. The reason for opacification remains unclear, but it seems to be unrelated to the patient's state; therefore, it is attributed to primary calcification.},

Built environment design is recognized as important in the care and management of responsive behaviors for those living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in secured dementia care units (e.g., exiting attempts, agitation). The repetitious behavior of "walking with purpose" (previously termed wandering) in those with dementia has influenced safety-related architectural design components of dementia care units that decrease exiting attempts. Empirical literature addressing design interventions to prevent exiting for those with dementia is lacking and outdated. We sought to describe known design techniques through a topical analysis of experimental studies. A thorough search for empirical studies that assessed interior design interventions at exit doors within dementia care units was undertaken. The review included an extensive search for existing literature and a screening of each study identified for its relevance, quality, and applicability. The experimental studies included in the review collectively assessed five interior design interventions at egress doorways: implementing horizontal and vertical floor grid patterns, mirrors, murals, conditioning responses to color cues, and camouflaging door hardware or vision panels. Why empirical studies have not continued more recently as built environment trends have shifted toward promoting meaningful and purposeful movement through design are considered. Advances in our understanding around the pathophysiology of dementia which might affect future design interventions related to egress are also identified. The built environment is an important part of dementia care, and further prospective research is needed on the role of design interventions in the context of exiting attempts within secured units and subsequent behavior outcomes.},

The level of evidence and strength of recommendation were judged according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation system. Diagnosis of AKI should be based on the KDIGO criteria. The preoperative risk factors are more related to the patient's predisposing factors and post-operative risk factors tend to be difficult to control. Therefore, focusing on intra-operative risk factors it would be important to maintain an adequate hemodynamics and to keep inferior vena cava clamping as short as possible. Biomarkers to identify AKI at an early stage are available; however, there is a lack of robust data that indicates their true beneficial effect. Intraoperative renal replacement therapy may be beneficial in some selective cases whereas its postoperative timing is still under debate. Perioperative liver transplant risk factors for acute kidney injury are difficult to control. Therefore, the focus should be on intra-operative hemodynamics and nephrotoxic drugs avoidance. Prospective randomized trials are needed to show the beneficial effect of early replacement therapy. In this context, the new biomarkers would be helpful in identifying kidney injury earlier.},

In order to identify molecular pathways that are consistently associated with OPMD, we performed an integrated high-throughput transcriptome study in affected muscles of OPMD animal models and patients. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) was found to be the most consistently and significantly OPMD-deregulated pathway across species. We could correlate the association of the UPS OPMD-deregulated genes with stages of disease progression. The expression trend of a subset of these genes is age-associated and therefore, marks the late onset of the disease, and a second group with expression trends relating to disease-progression. We demonstrate a correlation between expression trends and entrapment into PABPN1 insoluble aggregates of OPMD-deregulated E3 ligases. We also show that manipulations of proteasome and immunoproteasome activity specifically affect the accumulation and aggregation of mutant PABPN1. We suggest that the natural decrease in proteasome expression and its activity during muscle aging contributes to the onset of the disease.},

The derivation of gene regulatory networks from high-throughput expression data via machine learning strategies is problematic as the reliability of these models is often compromised by limited and highly variable samples, heterogeneity in transcript isoforms, noise, and other artifacts. Here, we develop a novel algorithm, dubbed Dandelion, in which we construct and train intraspecies Bayesian networks that are translated and assessed on independent test sets from other species in a reiterative procedure. The interspecies disease networks are subjected to multi-layers of analysis and evaluation, leading to the identification of the most consistent relationships within the network structure. In this study, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on datasets from animal models of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and patient materials. We show that the interspecies network of genes coding for the proteasome provide highly accurate predictions on gene expression levels and disease phenotype. Moreover, the cross-species translation increases the stability and robustness of these networks. Unlike existing modeling approaches, our algorithms do not require assumptions on notoriously difficult one-to-one mapping of protein orthologues or alternative transcripts and can deal with missing data. We show that the identified key components of the OPMD disease network can be confirmed in an unseen and independent disease model. This study presents a state-of-the-art strategy in constructing interspecies disease networks that provide crucial information on regulatory relationships among genes, leading to better understanding of the disease molecular mechanisms.},

Genome-wide RNA expression profiles from Vastus lateralis muscles human carriers of expanded-PABPN1 at pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages were compared with healthy controls. Major expression changes were found to be associated with age rather than with expression of expanded-PABPN1, instead transcriptomes of OPMD and elderly muscles were significantly similar (P<0.05). Using k-means clustering we identified age-dependent trends in both OPMD and controls, but trends were often accelerated in OPMD. We report an age-regulated decline in PABPN1 levels in Vastus lateralis muscles from the fifth decade. In concurrence with severe muscle degeneration in OPMD, the decline in PABPN1 accelerated in OPMD and was specific to skeletal muscles. Reduced PABPN1 levels (30% to 60%) in muscle cells induced myogenic defects and morphological signatures of cellular aging in proportion to PABPN1 expression levels. We suggest that PABPN1 levels regulate muscle cell aging and OPMD represents an accelerated muscle aging disorder.},

The effect is conserved for both the human and Drosophila proteins. Mutated Axin forms nonamyloid nanometer-scale aggregates decorated with disordered tentacles, which 'rewire' the Axin interactome. Importantly, the tumor-suppressor activity of both the human and Drosophila Axin cancer mutants is rescued by preventing aggregation of a single nonconserved segment. Our findings establish a new paradigm for misregulation of signaling in cancer and show that targeting aggregation-prone stretches in mutated scaffolds holds attractive potential for cancer treatment.},

Although this hypothesis has not been directly tested in large randomized clinical trials, the observations from prospective studies have been remarkably consistent in showing a late benefit of CT among the subgroup of patients who benefit (ie, women who were close to menopause). The hypothesis has important clinical implications, as it may be possible to spare the associated adverse effects of adjuvant CT in a select group of women with early breast cancer, in favor of optimizing OFS and endocrine therapy (ET), without compromising clinical outcomes. Such an approach has the added benefit of preserving the key quality of life outcomes in premenopausal women, particularly by preventing the irreversible loss of ovarian function that may result from CT use. For this reason, we convened an international panel of clinical experts in breast cancer treatment to discuss the key aspects of the available data in this area, as well as the potential clinical implications for patients. This article summarizes the results of these discussions and presents the consensus opinion of the panel regarding optimizing the use of OFS for premenopausal women with HR+, HER2- early breast cancer.},

GABAergic medial paracapsular intercalated cells (mpITCs) are thought to relay activity from basolateral nucleus (BLA) and prefrontal cortex to inhibit central amygdala output during suppression of fear. Recently, projection diversity and differential behavioral activation of mpITCs in distinct fear states suggest additional functions. Here, we show that mpITCs receive convergent sensory thalamic and cortical inputs that undergo fear learning-related changes and are dynamically modulated via presynaptic GABAB receptors recruited by GABA released from the mpITC network. Among mpITCs, we identify cells that inhibit but are also mutually activated by BLA principal neurons. Thus, mpITCs take part in fear learning-modulated feedforward and feedback inhibitory circuits to simultaneously control amygdala input and output nuclei. Our findings place mpITCs in a unique position to gate acquired amygdala-dependent behaviors via their direct sensory inputs.},

Application of the FRASE assay revealed HSA in brain homogenates of presymptomatic HD transgenic and knockin mice and its progressive increase with phenotypic changes, suggesting that HSA quantitatively tracks disease progression. Biochemical investigations of mouse brain homogenates demonstrated that small, rather than large, mHTT structures are responsible for the HSA measured in FRASE assays. Finally, we assessed the neurotoxicity of mHTT seeds in an inducible Drosophila model transgenic for HTTex1. We found a strong correlation between the HSA measured in adult neurons and the increased mortality of transgenic HD flies, indicating that FRASE assays detect disease-relevant, neurotoxic, mHTT structures with severe phenotypic consequences in vivo.},

The upper mini sternotomy (UMS) approach was performed in ten patients focusing on standardized surgical procedures, and rigorous postoperative care. Key findings indicate that MSARS markedly reduces postoperative complications, ICU stay, and overall hospital stay compared to traditional sternotomy. The median postoperative length of stay was seven days for MSARS versus 11 days for traditional sternotomy, with ICU stays of 27 hours and 105 hours, respectively. Our study also highlights the cost-effectiveness of MSARS, with decreased hospital costs per patient due to reduced ICU resource utilization and shorter hospital stays. These findings suggest that MSARS is a valuable and advantageous alternative to traditional sternotomy, offering substantial benefits in terms of patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.

In addition to ribosome biogenesis, nucleoli are critical for control of cell proliferation and stress responses. Our group previously demonstrated induction of the nucleolar protein nucleostemin (NS) in response to cardiac pathological insult. NS interacts with nucleophosmin (NPM), a marker of nucleolar stress with cytoprotective properties. The dynamic behavior of NS and NPM reveal that nucleolar disruption is an early event associated with stress response in cardiac cells. Rapid translocation of NS and NPM to the nucleoplasm and suppression of new preribosomal RNA synthesis occurs in both neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCM) and cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) upon exposure to doxorubicin or actinomycin D. Silencing of NS significantly increases cell death resulting from doxorubicin treatment in CPC, whereas NPM knockdown alone induces cell death. Overexpression of either NS or NPM significantly decreases caspase 8 activity in cultured cardiomyocytes challenged with doxorubicin. The presence of altered nucleolar structures resulting from myocardial infarction in mice supports the model of nucleolar stress as a general response to pathological injury. Collectively, these findings serve as the initial description of myocardial nucleolar stress and establish the postulate that nucleoli acts as sensors of stress, regulating the cellular response to pathological insults.},

This study therefore seeks to enrich our understanding of transitional care for individuals with 22q11DS by exploring the insights from healthcare professionals (HCPs) from Europe and Canada with multidisciplinary backgrounds. This interview study was part of a larger mixed-methods research project, with the qualitative component concentrating on gathering insights from HCPs involved in patient care through semi-structured interviews. We conducted qualitative thematic analysis while focusing on transitional care within families caring for a child with 22q11DS from the perspective of HCPs. The 20 HCPs interviewed came from diverse professional backgrounds and all had clinical experience with 22q11DS. Our analysis of the data identified three primary themes. Our participants emphasized the inadequacy of the transitional care system, despite its critical importance. HCPs tried their best to overcome the challenges by relying on longer follow-up with their patients, with some even merging children and adult services. There was a shared desire among HCPs for a structured transitional care plan, better access to adult services for 22q11DS, and a more integrated, collaborative approach. This study highlights the inadequacy of transitional care for individuals with 22q11DS and their families, showing a need to better align policies and clinical practice. Filling the gap between existing policies and the desired transitional care services is essential. The latter includes: an appropriate longitudinal transition plan, strong psychological support not only for the individual with 22q11DS but also for their family, a coordination system, and accessible adult services with expertise on 22q11DS.},

To address this, three experimental animal models of renal injury (streptozotocin diabetes I, unilateral ureteral ligation (UUO), and 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx)) were studied in either Nox4-inducible (Nox4(*/*)) or constitutive knockout (Nox4(-/-)) mice. Nox4 contributed more than 80% of diphenylene iodonium-sensitive H(2)O(2) formation of freshly isolated tubules determined by Amplex Red assay. In streptozotocin diabetes, acute deletion of Nox4 by tamoxifen-activated cre-recombinase increased albuminuria, whereas matrix deposition was similar between WT and Nox4(*/*) mice. Interestingly, renal Nox4 expression, mainly localized to tubular cells, decreased in the course of diabetes and this was not associated with a compensatory upregulation of Nox1 or Nox2. In the UUO model, renal expression of ICAM1, connective tissue growth factor, and fibronectin were higher in kidneys of Nox4(*/*) than control mice. Also in this model, levels of Nox4 decreased in the course of the disease. In the 5/6Nx model, which was performed in SV129 and SV129-Nox4(-/-) mice, no difference in the development of hypertension and albuminuria was found between the strains. Collectively, the first in vivo data of the kidney do not support the view that Nox4 is a main driver of renal disease. It rather appears that under specific conditions Nox4 may even slightly limit injury and disease progression.},

  abstract = {Rho-family GTPases like RhoA and Rac-1 are potent regulators of cellular signaling that control gene expression, migration and inflammation. Activation of Rho-GTPases has been linked to podocyte dysfunction, a feature of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). We investigated the effect of Rac-1 and Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibition on progressive renal failure in mice and studied the underlying mechanisms in podocytes. SV129 mice were subjected to 5/6-nephrectomy which resulted in arterial hypertension and albuminuria. Subgroups of animals were treated with the Rac-1 inhibitor EHT1846, the ROCK inhibitor SAR407899 and the ACE inhibitor Ramipril. Only Ramipril reduced hypertension. In contrast, all inhibitors markedly attenuated albumin excretion as well as glomerular and tubulo-interstitial damage. The combination of SAR407899 and Ramipril was more effective in preventing albuminuria than Ramipril alone. To study the involved mechanisms, podocytes were cultured from SV129 mice and exposed to static stretch in the Flexcell device. This activated RhoA and Rac-1 and led via TGFβ to apoptosis and a switch of the cells into a more mesenchymal phenotype, as evident from loss of WT-1 and nephrin and induction of α-SMA and fibronectin expression. Rac-1 and ROCK inhibition as well as blockade of TGFβ dramatically attenuated all these responses. This suggests that Rac-1 and RhoA are mediators of podocyte dysfunction in CKD. Inhibition of Rho-GTPases may be a novel approach for the treatment of CKD.},

In these organelles, activated sugars are substrates for various glycosyltransferases involved in oligo- and polysaccharide biosynthesis. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains more than 40 members of this transporter gene family, of which only a few are functionally characterized. In this study, two Arabidopsis UDP-galactose transporter cDNAs (UDP-GalT1 and UDP-GalT2) are isolated by expression cloning using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-Lec8) deficient in UDP-galactose transport. The isolated genes show only 21% identity to each other and very limited sequence identity with human and yeast UDP-galactose transporters and other NSTs. Despite this low overall identity, the two proteins clearly belong to the same gene family. Besides complementing Lec8 cells, the two NSTs are shown to transport exclusively UDP-galactose by an in vitro NST assay. The most homologous proteins with known function are plant transporters that locate in the inner chloroplast membrane and transport triose-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate, and xylulose 5-phosphate. Also, the latter proteins are members of the same family, which therefore has been named the NST/triose-phosphate transporter family.},

Here, we demonstrate that expression of a hybrid enzyme (called xylGalT), consisting of the N-terminal domain of Arabidopsis thaliana xylosyltransferase and the catalytic domain of human beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase I (GalT), in tobacco causes a sharp reduction of N-glycans with potentially immunogenic core-bound xylose (Xyl) and fucose (Fuc) residues as shown by Western blot and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. A radioallergosorbent test inhibition assay with proteins purified from leaves of WT and these transgenic tobacco plants using sera from allergic patients suggests a significant reduction of potential immunogenicity of xylGalT proteins. A mAb purified from leaves of plants expressing xylGalT displayed an N-glycan profile that featured high levels of galactose, undetectable xylose, and a trace of fucose. Hence, a transgenic plant expressing the hybrid GalT might yield more effective and safer monoclonals for therapeutic purposes than WT plants and even transgenic plants expressing the unchanged GalT.},

However, recently evidence has been provided for the presence of sialic acid in these evolutionary clades. In addition, homologs of mammalian genes involved in sialylation can be found in the genomes of these taxa and for some Drosophila enzymes, involvement in sialic acid metabolism has been documented. In plant genomes, homologs of sialyltransferase genes have been identified, but there activity could not be confirmed. Several mammalian cell lines exist with defects in the sialylation pathway. One of these is the Chinese hamster ovary cell line Lec2, deficient in CMP-sialic acid transport to the Golgi lumen. These mutants provide the possibility to clone genes by functional complementation. Using expression cloning, we have identified an Arabidopsis thaliana nucleotide sugar transporter that is able to complement the CMP-sialic acid transport deficiency of Lec2 cells. The isolated gene (At5g41760) is a member of the triose-phosphate/nucleotide sugar transporter gene family. Recombinant expression of the gene in yeast and testing in vitro confirmed its ability to transport CMP-sialic acid.},

This study confirms rapid changes in erythrocyte membrane phospholipid composition after administration of intravenous n-3 PUFAs. Erythrocyte deformability parameters were not affected but erythrocyte aggregability was decreased in the n-3 PUFA group. Further investigation is necessary to gain more insights in the effects of n-3 PUFA and the postoperative inflammatory response on erythrocyte function.},

This study explored (a) key aspects of crisis communication and (b) explicit consideration of people's health literacy needs in communication to people with RMDs during the first wave of COVID-19 in the Netherlands. We conducted a convergent, qualitatively driven mixed-methods study comprising seven qualitative interviews with professional representatives of organisations responsible for information provision to people with RMDs, and quantitative analysis of 15 patient information materials distributed by these organisations. The study was guided by principles of crisis communication and health literacy. We assessed understandability and actionability of information materials using the Dutch version of the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT, resulting in a percentage of quality criteria met), and language difficulty level using an online application (assessing difficult words, jargon, passive, complex and long sentences, long paragraphs, and difficulty levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR, from A1 (basic) to C2 (proficient))). Respondents reported lack of preparedness, challenges related to scientific uncertainty and reaching the target group, difficulty simplifying information, and uncertainty regarding adequacy of the communication approach. Patient information materials (written and video) showed variation in actionability (range 60-100%) and understandability (range 58-100%), and 69% of written materials were too difficult, mostly due to the use of long sentences and difficult words. The quantitative findings were in coherence with the limitations in communication reported by respondents. Several potential improvements were formulated in 'lessons learned'. Although rheumatology organisations mostly adhered to principles of crisis communication and made efforts to adapt information to their audience's needs, we propose recommendations to improve preparedness, strategy, content, reach and consideration of health literacy needs in future crisis communication.},

We also explore how these trends compare to previous cohorts, particularly the 2014-2017 Multicenter Arthroscopic Study of the Hip (MASH) study. In response to the rapid growth of hip arthroscopy literature, we hypothesize that surgeons are operating on patients with a lower average body mass index (BMI), younger age, less severe reported symptoms at the time of surgery, and shorter preoperative symptom duration. The MASH database was searched for patients who underwent hip arthroscopy for treatment of FAI between 2018 and 2023, and had demographic data available in the registry. Standardized data included demographics, symptoms, imaging, intraoperative diagnoses (labral tears, cartilage lesions) and patient-reported outcome measures (International Hip Outcome Tool 12-item [iHOT-12], modified Harris Hip Score [mHHS], HOS, Visual Analogue Scale, 12-item Short Form Health Survey, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System). Our study found that patients who elected to undergo hip arthroscopy between 2018 and 2023 at eight different US-based sites were, on average, 34.3 years old with a body mass index of 25.0 kg/m². The majority experienced symptoms for at least 4 months (91.4%), with 33.4% reporting symptoms lasting over 2 years. Symptoms were frequently exacerbated by athletic activities (86.6%) and sitting (63.8%). Prior to surgery, patients reported substantial functional limitations and impaired well-being, with a mean iHOT-12 score of 38.7 and a mHHS of 56.0. At 2-year follow-up, 85.9% and 76.4% of patients reached our distribution-based minimal clinically important difference value for mHHS and iHOT-12, respectively. This multicenter data set has demonstrated improved patient-reported symptoms at the time of surgery, a decrease in mean patient BMI, and an increase in symptom duration reported prior to surgery. This data provides a contemporary benchmark for hip arthroscopy patient characteristics, reaffirms the efficacy of hip arthroscopy, and indicates earlier and more effective diagnosis of abnormal hip morphology.

However, the existing literature presents mixed results indicating both significant and insignificant effects of smartphone-delivered interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the impact of smartphone-delivered ABMT on attentional bias and symptoms of mental health problems. Specifically, we examined different design approaches and methods of administration, focusing on common mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, and design elements, including gamification and stimulus types. Our search spanned from 2014 to 2023 and encompassed 4 major databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus. Study selection, data extraction, and critical appraisal were performed independently by 3 authors using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. When necessary, we pooled the standardized mean difference with a 95% CI. In addition, we conducted sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses to explore moderator variables of active and placebo ABMT interventions on reducing symptoms of mental health problems and attentional bias. Our review included 12 papers, involving a total of 24,503 participants, and we were able to conduct a meta-analysis on 20 different study samples from 11 papers. Active ABMT exhibited an effect size (Hedges g) of -0.18 (P=.03) in reducing symptoms of mental health problems, while the overall effect remained significant. Similarly, placebo ABMT showed an effect size of -0.38 (P=.008) in reducing symptoms of mental health problems. In addition, active ABMT (Hedges g -0.17; P=.004) had significant effects on reducing attentional bias, while placebo ABMT did not significantly alter attentional bias (Hedges g -0.04; P=.66). Our understanding of smartphone-delivered ABMT's potential highlights the value of both active and placebo interventions in mental health care. The insights from the moderator analysis also showed that tailoring smartphone-delivered ABMT interventions to specific threat stimuli and considering exposure duration are crucial for optimizing their efficacy. This research underscores the need for personalized approaches in ABMT to effectively reduce attentional bias and symptoms of mental health problems.

With increasing anxiety symptoms, participants' dwell time on neutral compared to angry female faces increased, yet no effects were observed for male faces. Similarly, with decreasing social competence, participants' dwell time on neutral compared to angry female faces increased, yet no differences were observed for male faces. Contrary to the hypothesis, social competence did not account for the effects of anxiety on attention allocation. No effects were observed for latency to first fixation. Anxiety and social competence are both independently associated with attentional biases toward facial expressions in female participants.

These VEs can offer great flexibility, replicability, and control over the presented stimuli in an immersive setting. With recent developments, it has become feasible to achieve higher-quality visuals and VEs at a reasonable investment. Our aim in this project was to develop and implement a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI)-based neurofeedback (NF) training paradigm, taking into account new technological advances that allow us to integrate complex stimuli into a visually updated and engaging VE. We built upon and developed a first-person shooter in which the dynamic change of the VE was the feedback variable in the brain-computer interface (BCI). We designed a study to assess the feasibility of the BCI in creating an immersive VE for NF training. In a randomized single-blinded fMRI-based NF-training session, 24 participants were randomly allocated into one of two groups: active and reduced contingency NF. All participants completed three runs of the shooter-game VE lasting 10 min each. Brain activity in a supplementary motor area region of interest regulated the possible movement speed of the player's avatar and thus increased the reward probability. The gaming performance revealed that the participants were able to actively engage in game tasks and improve across sessions. All 24 participants reported being able to successfully employ NF strategies during the training while performing in-game tasks with significantly higher perceived NF control ratings in the NF group. Spectral analysis showed significant differential effects on brain activity between the groups. Connectivity analysis revealed significant differences, showing a lowered connectivity in the NF group compared to the reduced contingency-NF group. The self-assessment manikin ratings showed an increase in arousal in both groups but failed significance. Arousal has been linked to presence, or feelings of immersion, supporting the VE's objective. Long paradigms, such as NF in MRI settings, can lead to mental fatigue; therefore, VEs can help overcome such limitations. The rewarding achievements from gaming targets can lead to implicit learning of self-regulation and may broaden the scope of NF applications.},

We used the FLAIR sequence to study patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) at 0.6 T. So far, a very long TR (and long acquisition time) has been used in a fully relaxed (FR-FLAIR) system. To speed up the FLAIR sequences, we used a shorter TR, and demonstrated that complete CSF suppression can be maintained with partial saturation (PS-FLAIR) by reducing TI at the same time. The introduction of partial saturation, however, reduced the contrast between lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Suboptimal CSF suppression therefore had to be accepted to maintain sufficient lesion to NAWM contrast. Using a TE of 60 ms, the PS-FLAIR and FR-FLAIR performed equally well in the detection of MS-lesions, although the former provided poorer CSF suppression. Both FLAIR sequences, however, provided poorer constrast between lesions and NAWM compared to conventional spin-echo sequences. Although the long acquisition time of the FLAIR sequence can be reduced by using partial saturation, complete CSF suppression and good lesion to NAWM contrast are incompatible at short TRs. Using a TE of 60 ms, conventional spin-echo sequences detect more lesions and provide better contrast between lesions and NAWM than FLAIR sequences in MS patients.},

For volume stable indications, only non-absorbable synthetic materials are available. This study investigates a new bioresorbable hydrofluoric acid (HF)-treated magnesium (Mg) mesh in a native collagen membrane for volume stable situations. HF-treated and untreated Mg were compared in direct and indirect cytocompatibility assays. In vivo, 18 New Zealand White Rabbits received each four 8 mm calvarial defects and were divided into four groups: (a) HF-treated Mg mesh/collagen membrane, (b) untreated Mg mesh/collagen membrane (c) collagen membrane and (d) sham operation. After 6, 12 and 18 weeks, Mg degradation and bone regeneration was measured using radiological and histological methods. In vitro, HF-treated Mg showed higher cytocompatibility. Histopathologically, HF-Mg prevented gas cavities and was degraded by mononuclear cells via phagocytosis up to 12 weeks. Untreated Mg showed partially significant more gas cavities and a fibrous tissue reaction. Bone regeneration was not significantly different between all groups. HF-Mg meshes embedded in native collagen membranes represent a volume stable and biocompatible alternative to the non-absorbable synthetic materials. HF-Mg shows less corrosion and is degraded by phagocytosis. However, the application of membranes did not result in higher bone regeneration.},

  abstract = {The present study investigates the in vivo tissue reaction and the integration behavior of an injectable bone substitute material (IBS) composed of a water-based gel combined with nano hydroxyapatite particles and biphasic calcium phosphate granules. The results of the IBS were compared to biphasic bone substitute granules (BBSM) of the same chemical composition. The subcutaneous implantation model in 40 female 5-week-old CD-1 mice up to 60 days after implantation was used for conduction of the in vivo experiments. Moreover, established histological, histopathological and histomorphometrical methods were applied. The results showed that the IBS was gradually invaded by cells and complex tissue elements. Thus, the implant bed could be distinguished in two areas, i.e. an outer and inner region. While the outer region started to interact with the peri-implant tissue by evoking multinucleated giant cells and at earlier time points by undergoing a continuous high vascularization, the inner part was free of peri-implant cells for at least 30 days, starting to undergo a similar tissue reaction at a later time point. The bone substitute granules allowed for a fast tissue influx between the interspaces of the granules starting at day 10. While the vessel density did not differ in both groups up to the end of the study, the amount of vascularization was significantly higher over the entire observation period in the BBSM group. Moreover, the amount of biomaterial-associated multinucleated giant cells (BMGCs) was significantly higher in the IBS group in the period of between 15 to 30 days after implantation, while comparable BMGC numbers were found in both groups towards the end of the study. IBS can build a barrier-like structure that is able to control the soft tissue influx into the central regions of the implantation bed, which could not be observed in other bone substitute granules of the same chemical composition. This directed integration behavior is assumed to be in accordance with the concept of Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR). Furthermore, BMGCs can significantly influence the process of angiogenesis within an implant bed of a biomaterial but not the maturity of blood vessels.},

The present study aimed to compare the detection validity and expression pattern of the TRAP enzyme using enzymatic and immunohistochemical detection methods in the context of biocompatibility analyses of BSM. Biopsies from 8 patients were analyzed after sinus augmentation with a xenogeneic bone substitute. Analysis of both macrophage and BMGC polarization were performed by histochemical TRAP detection and immunohistochemical detection of TRAP5a. Histomorphometrical analysis was used for comparison of the TRAP detection of BMGCs. The enzymatic TRAP detection method revealed that in 7 out of 8 biopsies only single cells were TRAP-positive, whereas most of the cells and especially the BMGCs were TRAP-negative. The immunohistochemical detection of TRAP5a showed moderate numbers of stained mononuclear cells, while the majority of the BMGCs showed signs of TRAP5a-expression. The enzymatic TRAP detection was comparable to the results obtained via immunohistochemistry only in one case. The histomorphometrical analysis showed that significantly more mononuclear and multinucleated TRAP-positive cells were found using immunohistochemical TRAP5a-staining compared to the enzymatic TRAP detection method. Also, significantly more TRAP-negative BMGCs were found using the enzymatic TRAP detection. The immunohistochemical detection of TRAP is more accurate for examination of the bioactivity and cellular degradability of BSM.},

The current study is a follow-up of these infants at the age of 12 and 23 months, and examined whether the group that started weaning with vegetables continued eating more vegetables than the group that started weaning with fruits. At 12 (n = 86) and 23 (n = 81) months of age the children's daily vegetable consumption was reported by their parents using a 3-day food diary. The intake of green beans and apple purée was measured in the laboratory. Reported daily intake of vegetables at 12 months of age was 38 % higher (P = 0.02) in the vegetable group (75 ± 43 g) than in the fruit group (54 ± 29 g), but was similar for both groups at 23 months of age (49 ± 43, 57 ± 35 g, respectively; NS). Both at 12 and 23 months of age, apple and green beans intake in the lab did not differ significantly between the groups. These findings suggest that weaning exclusively with vegetables results in a higher daily vegetable consumption until at least 12 months of age. More research is needed to investigate how to maintain this effect.},

A comprehensive search strategy was performed using the databases Scopus and Pubmed. Articles published before March 2018 measuring vegetable intake and/or liking were included. 46 papers, 25 experimental (intervention) studies, and 21 observational studies were included. Intervention studies revealed that repeated exposure increased acceptance of the target vegetable, whereas exposure to variety was found to be particularly effective in increasing acceptance of a new vegetable. Starting complementary feeding with vegetables increased vegetable acceptance, whereas starting with fruits did not. Visual exposure to an unfamiliar vegetable increased the acceptance of that vegetable even without consuming it, while visual exposure to a familiar vegetable did not. A stepwise introduction of vegetables resulted in better initial acceptance of vegetables than introducing vegetables directly. Observational studies showed that vegetable consumption was associated with frequency of exposure, exposure to variety, and modelling. A majority of studies found a positive association between breastfeeding and vegetable acceptance, but only two out of seven studies found an association between age of vegetable introduction and their acceptance. Based on the papers reviewed, we conclude that introducing vegetables at the beginning of complementary feeding, giving a different type of vegetable every day and ensuring repeated exposure to the same vegetable following an interval of a few days are the most promising strategies to promote vegetable intake in children starting complementary feeding until they are 3 years of age.},

In these locations, lipid crystal clefts and perivascular macrophages, neuronal loss, demyelination, fibrosis, and reactive astrocytosis were found at microscopic examination. Hypointensity was sometimes found on T2-weighted images in the dentate nucleus and was related to deposition of hemosiderin and calcifications. CT depicted fewer lesions; all had low attenuation, except for the calcifications. Spinal cord MR imaging revealed increased signal intensity in the lateral and dorsal columns on T2-weighted images.

For all controls together, the averaged peak velocity was 4.2 +/- 1.5 cm/s in rostral and -7.8 +/- 4.9 cm/s in caudal direction; for the flux it was 0.16 +/- 0.10 cm3/s in rostral and -0.29 +/- 0.19 cm3/s in caudal direction. Phase-contrast measurements were significantly related to flow-void on modulus MR images, but not with ventricular size or cortical atrophy.

Thirteen patients with definite MS received a total of 31 courses of methylprednisolone over an average period of 50 weeks. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI was obtained before and after treatment, then at monthly intervals, using a standardised repositioning and imaging protocol. Two experienced readers in conference defined the number of active (gadolinium-enhancing and new or enlarging nonenhancing) lesions. We detected 609 active lesions on 195 examinations. Directly after treatment the reduction in the number of enhancing lesions was 78%, indicating restoration of the BBB and suppression of inflammation. It was uncommon for a lesion which stopped enhancing to show enhancement on a subsequent examination. No beneficial effect was observed on the rate of disappearance of related abnormalities on T2-weighted images, indicating persistent change such as oedema, cellular infiltration or demyelination. Moreover, in 89% of cases, an increase in the number of active lesions was observed before new clinical activity, if any, was observed (on average 52% earlier).

The contrast between tumour and ipsilateral vitreous strongly increased (57 %) after gadolinium on T1-weighted images (p = 0.004). Tumour was strongly hypointense as compared with ipsilateral vitreous in all patients using heavily T2-weighted (TE = 120 ms) images (p = 0.001). The estimated T2 of tumour (mean 96 + 14 ms) did not correlate with histological grading or degree of calcification. Unenhanced T1-weighted MR images rightfully excluded extrascleral growth in 16 of 16 cases, but its presence was confirmed after enucleation in only one of 2 abnormal MR scans.

  abstract = {In multiple sclerosis (MS), periventricular lesions produce atrophy of the corpus callosum (CC), as evidenced by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We investigated whether CC atrophy in relapsing-remitting MS patients is related to functional deficits. We compared 14 mildly disabled (mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score 2.7) relapsing-remitting MS patients with 14 age- und sex-matched controls. CC size was determined using sagittal T1-weighted MRI. The function of the CC was studied using a neuropsychological battery and neurophysiological evaluation based on visual stimulation using a divided visual field paradigm. The total area of the CC in patients (mean 5.3 cm2) was significantly (P = 0.002) smaller than in controls (mean 6.6 cm2). Patients showed left ear extinction using the dichotic listening test and impaired name learning, which was correlated with atrophy of the splenium. There were no differences in interhemispheric transfer time between patients and controls. Marked atrophy of the CC can be encountered in relapsing-remitting MS patients. The associated cerebral disconnection correlated with atrophy of expected regions of the CC, thus supporting topographical organization.},

  abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA), characterized by degeneration of the cartilaginous tissue in articular joints, severely impairs mobility in many people worldwide. The degeneration is thought to be mediated by inflammatory processes occurring in the tissue of the joint, including the cartilage. Intra-articular administered triamcinolone acetonide (TAA) is one of the drug treatments employed to ameliorate the inflammation and pain that characterizes OA. However, the penetration and distribution of TAA into the avascular cartilage is not well understood. We employed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which has been previously used to directly monitor the distribution of drugs in biological tissues, to evaluate the distribution of TAA in human cartilage after in vitro incubation. Unfortunately, TAA is not easily ionized by regular electrospray ionization (ESI) or MALDI. To overcome this problem, we developed an on-tissue derivatization method with Girard's reagent T (GirT) in human incubated cartilage being able to study its distribution and quantify the drug abundance (up to 3.3 ng/μL). Our results demonstrate the depth of penetration of a corticosteroid drug in human OA cartilage using MALDI-MSI.},

Its manual volumetric assessment is, however, too demanding to be implemented in clinical practice. To assess the value of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the automatic segmentation of infarct volume in follow-up CT images in a large population of patients with acute ischemic stroke. We included CT images of 1026 patients from a large pooling of patients with acute ischemic stroke. A reference standard for the infarct segmentation was generated by manual delineation. We introduce three CNN models for the segmentation of subtle, intermediate, and severe hypodense lesions. The fully automated infarct segmentation was defined as the combination of the results of these three CNNs. The results of the three-CNNs approach were compared with the results from a single CNN approach and with the reference standard segmentations. The median infarct volume was 48 mL (IQR 15-125 mL). Comparison between the volumes of the three-CNNs approach and manually delineated infarct volumes showed excellent agreement, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.88. Even better agreement was found for severe and intermediate hypodense infarcts, with ICCs of 0.98 and 0.93, respectively. Although the number of patients used for training in the single CNN approach was much larger, the accuracy of the three-CNNs approach strongly outperformed the single CNN approach, which had an ICC of 0.34. Convolutional neural networks are valuable and accurate in the quantitative assessment of infarct volumes, for both subtle and severe hypodense infarcts in follow-up CT images. Our proposed three-CNNs approach strongly outperforms a more straightforward single CNN approach.},

A steady generation of fibrin and fibrinogen-fibrin complexes during treatment with haemodialysis is indicated by increasing results for thrombus precursor protein.

In due course, a steady, on-going generation of thrombin antithrombin complexes was observed in several subjects, especially after treatment with F-60 membranes, amounting to increases exceeding 100% of initial values.

At the time of hospitalization percentages concerning the incidence of decreased serum concentrations reflecting an inappropriate nutrient state in the subject group amounted to 28% for vitamin B12, 20% for folate, 36% for iron, 12% for transferrin and 56% for albumin concentrations. Increased plasma concentrations of homocysteine combined with decreased folate concentrations were found in 16% of the psychogeriatric patients. If compared with the initial results at admission, after three weeks of nutrient supplementation the vitamin B12 and folate serum concentrations were increased. Results for serum iron concentrations remained below the reference range interval in 5 of the 25 subjects reflecting iron deficiency. Initially decreased serum transferrin concentrations did not return to the reference range. Serum albumin levels still further decreased after admission to the hospital, resulting after three weeks in albumin concentrations below the reference range for 68% of the subjects. It is concluded that supplementation of folate and vitamin B12 lowered homocysteine plasma concentrations successfully. Supplementation of protein nutrients is not appropriate in order to restore disturbances of protein metabolism. Persisting low concentrations of proteins in serum are indicative of irreversible decreased synthesis.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate alterations with regard to the degree of hemoglobinization in reticulocytes in comparison with mature erythrocytes. Iron availability in subjects with anemia resulting from iron deficiency and alpha- or beta- thalassemia was studied by application of conventional as well hemocytometric parameters that have recently become available. Participants of the study were reference subjects (n=75), subjects with iron deficiency anemia (IDA, n=52) and alpha- (n=26) or beta-thalassemia trait (n=24). If compared with the reference group obviously increased RBC counts together with decreased values for RDW-sd and MCHC were established in case of alpha- and beta- thalassemia subjects. Deviations were demonstrated to be more pronounced in case of beta- thalassemia. Accelerated erythropoiesis in the case of subjects with IDA and beta-thalassemia is manifested by detection of increased results for immature reticulocyte counts. In particular in case of beta- thalassemia, elevated reticulocyte counts combined with slightly increased values for ZPP/heme ratio reflect increased activity of erythropoiesis. In the case of subjects with beta-thalassemia serum transferrin concentrations revealed slightly decreased results, whereas serum ferritin and iron concentrations demonstrated a tendency towards higher values if compared with the group of reference subjects. At a definitive MCV level, the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes is decreased in the case of IDA if compared with the alpha- or beta- thalassemia trait. For the ratio of hemoglobin content of reticulocytes and erythrocytes, obviously decreased results are demonstrated in the case of subjects with iron deficiency anemia (1.02 +/- 0.08, mean +/- SD) and in the case of beta-thalassemia (1.06 +/- 0.04) if compared with the group of reference subjects (1.11 +/- 0.02) and a-thalassemia (1.11 +/- 0.07). Evaluation of the hemoglobinization state should be performed by means of pattern recognition in concordance with characteristic profiles for parameters reflecting the actual iron state. In case of therapy the result of intervention can be appropriately monitored by longitudinal follow-up.},

In routine investigations, pseudothrombocytopenia could be highly suspected when the Sysmex NE 8000 showed characteristic peculiarities in the white blood cell (WBC) scattergram and histogram. Platelet aggregation is avoided in such cases by the use of citrate as an anticoagulant instead of EDTA. Pseudothrombocytopenia was detected in 46 subjects.

  abstract = {The ban on assisted suicide "intended as a recurring pursuit" was lifted by the German Federal Constitutional Court in 2020. Consequently, the German Medical Council repealed § 16 sentence 3 of the (model) professional code ("They [doctors] may not provide assistance for suicide"). Two legislative proposals to regulate assisted suicide failed in the German Bundestag in 2023. To date, medical staff lack a basis for action when dealing with patients who wish to die. The opinions, attitudes and perspectives of professional groups are important with regard to assisted suicide in order to be able to draw up practical regulations that can be implemented in everyday medical practice. The aim of this survey is to assess the knowledge about the legal situation in Germany as well as perceptions and attitudes towards assisted suicide among members of the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI). The study group developed a questionnaire in repeated interdisciplinary and multiprofessional discussions based on a literature review and a previous survey among younger physicians. The questionnaire consisted of questions on the legal and statutory situation of assisted suicide in Germany, personal attitudes and demographic data. It was distributed via the DGAI member newsletter using an online link. From 08/2023-01/2024, out of 25,573 reachable members, 1056 viewed the survey (view rate: 4%), 822 participated, of which 686 completed the questionnaire (completion rate: 83%). Of all participants, 99% (n = 676/686) were physicians; 56% (n = 385/686) were older than 50 years. 45% (n = 310/686) of participants stated that they were aware of the judgment on the invalidity of section 217 of the German criminal code. 86% (n = 589/686) of respondents incorrectly believed that it is prohibited in Germany to offer assisted suicide intended as a recurring pursuit and 21% (n = 142/686) of respondents falsely believed that assisted suicide is a criminal offense in Germany. 77% (n = 527/686) would prefer a new legal regulation on assisted suicide in order to achieve greater legal certainty. 55% (n = 374/686) stated that healthcare workers are the appropriate point of contact to decide on the permissibility of assisted suicide. Of all respondants, 45% (n = 305/686) have asked patients about the existence of death wishes in their professional career; 23% (n = 159/686) of respondents have never done so. 71% (n = 486/686) declined to participate in assisted suicide for patients regardless of the health condition; 65% (n = 443/686) indicated they could only envision participation in a palliative care setting. Participating members of the DGAI show a lack of knowledge regarding the current legal framework surrounding assisted suicide in Germany. They express the hope that future legal regulations will provide legal certainty in this sensitive area. The findings of this study highlight the complexity inherent in the issue of assisted suicide. Subsequent research and policy development should focus on addressing the needs and challenges faced by clinicians and patients, while fostering the establishment of clear guidelines and regulatory frameworks to ensure the provision of safe and ethically responsible care.},

  abstract = {The poor fertility after orchiopexy can be due either to the previously prolonged high abdominal temperature, to surgical trauma or to congenitally malformed or dissociated testis and epididymis. In order to test whether manipulation of the testis and the spermatic cord in juvenile dogs causes damage to the seminiferous epithelium after puberty, orchiopexy was performed stepwise in 31 normal young dogs. In four dogs, in which traction to the proper testis ligament or biopsy was carried out, a significantly lower relative testis weight was found, together with impaired differentiation of the seminiferous epithelium. From these experiments it was clear that surgical procedures in the inguinal and scrotal region do not necessarily affect the development of the seminiferous epithelium in the dog. However, trauma to the vaginal tunic seemed to be crucial, causing damage to the differentiation of the seminiferous epithelium.},

We now report that this receptor complex is modified by the recruitment of syndecan-2 (Sdc2), the Recepteur d'Origine Nantais (RON) tyrosine kinase, and the cellular signaling mediator Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (ABL1) in triple-negative breast carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, where it contributes to EGFR kinase-independent proliferation.

  abstract = {Optimal treatment of bone fractures with minimal complications requires implant alloys that combine high strength with high ductility. Today, TiAl6V4 titanium and 316L steel are the most applied alloys in bone surgery, whereas both share advantages and disadvantages. The nickel-free, high-nitrogen austenitic steel X13CrMnMoN18-14-3 (1.4452, brand name: P2000) exhibits high strength in combination with superior ductility. In order to compare suitable alloys for bone implants, we investigated titanium, 316L steel, CoCrMo and P2000 for their biocompatibility and hemocompatibility (according to DIN ISO 10993-5 and 10993-4), cell metabolism, mineralization of osteoblasts, electrochemical and mechanical properties. P2000 exhibited good biocompatibility of fibroblasts and osteoblasts without impairment in vitality or changing of cell morphology. Furthermore, investigation of the osteoblasts function by ALP activity and protein levels of the key transcription factor RUNX2 revealed 2x increased ALP activity and more than 4x increased RUNX2 protein levels for P2000 compared to titanium or 316 steel, respectively. Additionally, analyses of osteoblast biomineralization by Alizarin Red S staining exhibited more than 6x increased significant mineralization of osteoblasts grown on P2000 as compared to titanium. Further, P2000 showed no hemolytic effect and no significant influence on hemocompatibility. Nanoindentation hardness tests of Titanium and 316L specimens exposed an indentation hardness (HIT) of about 4 GPa, whereas CoCrMo and P2000 revealed HIT of 7.5 and 5.6 GPa, respectively. Moreover, an improved corrosion resistance of P2000 compared to 316L steel was observed. In summary, we could demonstrate that the nickel-free high-nitrogen steel P2000 appears to be a promising alternative candidate for applications in bone surgery. As to nearly all aspects like biocompatibility and hemocompatibility, cell metabolism, mineralization of osteoblasts and mechanical properties, P2000 was similar to or revealed advantages against titanium, 316L or CoCrMo.},

  abstract = {Titanium is one of the most commonly used materials for implants in trauma applications due to its low density, high corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. Nevertheless, there is still a need for improved surface modifications of Titanium, in order to change surface properties such as wettability, antibacterial properties or tissue attachment. In this study, different novel plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) modifications have been investigated for tendon adhesion to implants commonly used in hand surgery. Titanium samples with four different PEO modifications were prepared by varying the electrolyte composition and analyzed with regards to their surface properties. Unmodified titanium blanks and Dotize® coating served as controls. Samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), contact angle measuring system and analyzed for their biocompatibility and hemocompatibility (according to DIN ISO 10993-5 and 10,993-4). Finally, tendon adhesion of these specific surfaces were investigated by pull-off tests. Our findings show that surface thickness of PEO modifications was about 12-20 μm and had porous morphology. One modification demonstrated hydrophilic behavior accompanied by good biocompatibility without showing cytotoxic properties. Furthermore, no hemolytic effect and no significant influence on hemocompatibility were observed. Pull-off tests revealed a significant reduction of tendon adhesion by 64.3% (35.7% residual adhesion), compared to unmodified titanium (100%). In summary, the novel PEO-based ceramic-like porous modification for titanium surfaces might be considered a good candidate for orthopedic applications supporting a more efficient recovery.},

We demonstrated in the past that volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver resection. In this randomized study, we examined if volatile anesthetics have an effect on acute graft injury and clinical outcomes after liver transplantation. Cadaveric liver transplant recipients were enrolled from January 2009 to September 2012 at 3 University Centers (Zurich/Sao Paulo/Ghent). Recipients were randomly assigned to propofol (control group) or sevoflurane anesthesia. Postoperative peak of aspartate transaminase was defined as primary endpoint, secondary endpoints were early allograft dysfunction, in-hospital complications, intensive care unit, and hospital stay. Ninety-eight recipients were randomized to propofol (n = 48) or sevoflurane (n = 50). Median peak aspartate transaminase after transplantation was 925 (interquartile range, 512-3274) in the propofol and 1097 (interquartile range, 540-2633) in the sevoflurane group. In the propofol arm, 11 patients (23%) experienced early allograft dysfunction, 7 (14%) in the sevoflurane one (odds ratio, 0.64 (0.20 to 2.02, P = 0.45). There were 4 mortalities (8.3%) in the propofol and 2 (4.0%) in the sevoflurane group. Overall and major complication rates were not different. An effect on clinical outcomes was observed favoring the sevoflurane group (less severe complications), but without significance. This first multicenter trial comparing propofol with sevoflurane anesthesia in liver transplantation shows no difference in biochemical markers of acute organ injury and clinical outcomes between the 2 regimens. Sevoflurane has no significant added beneficial effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury compared to propofol.},

It is an oxidized sesquiterpene, which has been postulated to be derived from valencene. Both valencene and nootkatone are used for flavouring citrus beverages and are considered among the most valuable terpenes used at commercial scale. Functional evaluation of putative terpene synthase genes sourced by large-scale EST sequencing from Nootka cypress wood revealed a valencene synthase gene (CnVS). CnVS expression in different tissues from the tree correlates well with nootkatone content, suggesting that CnVS represents the first dedicated gene in the nootkatone biosynthetic pathway in C. nootkatensis The gene belongs to the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily of terpenes synthases and its protein sequence has low similarity to known citrus valencene synthases. In vitro, CnVS displays high robustness under different pH and temperature regimes, potentially beneficial properties for application in different host and physiological conditions. Biotechnological production of sesquiterpenes has been shown to be feasible, but productivity of microbial strains expressing valencene synthase from Citrus is low, indicating that optimization of valencene synthase activity is needed. Indeed, expression of CnVS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated potential for higher yields. In an optimized Rhodobacter sphaeroides strain, expression of CnVS increased valencene yields 14-fold to 352 mg/L, bringing production to levels with industrial potential.},

This study describes a synthetic biology approach for β-ionone production from glucose by Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is partially based on polycistronic expression. Experiments with model proteins showed that the T2A sequence of the Thosea asigna virus mediated efficient production of individual proteins from a single transcript in S. cerevisiae. Subsequently, three β-carotene biosynthesis genes from the carotenoid-producing ascomycete Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (crtI, crtE and crtYB) were expressed in S. cerevisiae from a single polycistronic construct. In this construct, the individual crt proteins were separated by T2A sequences. Production of the individual proteins from the polycistronic construct was confirmed by Western blot analysis and by measuring the production of β-carotene. To enable β-ionone production, a carotenoid-cleavage dioxygenase from raspberry (RiCCD1) was co-expressed in the β-carotene producing strain. In glucose-grown cultures with a second phase of dodecane, β-ionone and geranylacetone accumulated in the organic phase. Thus, by introducing a polycistronic construct encoding a fungal carotenoid pathway and an expression cassette encoding a plant dioxygenase, a novel microbial production system has been established for a fruit flavour compound.},

With these tests no difference was found between algal oil and fish oil. The nonhydrolysed algal oils and fish oil showed a much lower toxic effect on cell viability, and cell proliferation in Caco-2 cells than the hydrolysed oils and the free fatty acids (FFAs). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3) were used as samples for comparison with the tested hydrolysed and nonhydrolysed oils.

Oxidative stress was shown to play a role in the antiproliferative properties of EPA and DHA, as alpha-tocopherol could partially reverse the EPA/DHA-induced effects.

Despite the difference in fatty acid composition and total amount of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) between microalgal oil and fish oil, both these oils gave the same 50% reduction of AOM-induced ACF when compared to corn oil. To determine whether oxidative stress could play a role in the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer by n-3 PUFAs, feces and caecal content were examined using the TBA assay. The results showed that lipid peroxidation does occur in the gastrointestinal tract. As several lipid peroxidation products of n-3 PUFAs can induce phase II detoxifying enzymes by an EpRE-mediated pathway, the in vivo results suggest that this route may contribute to n-3 PUFA-mediated chemoprevention. All in all, n-3 PUFA-rich oil from microalgae is as good as fish oil regarding chemoprevention in the colon of the rat.},

In 317 patients undergoing reconstructive surgery on the internal carotid artery, simultaneous recordings of SEP and rSO2 were obtained throughout the operation. All 287 patients with preserved cortical SEP remained neurologically intact. Shunt placement was performed in 27 patients (9%) after flattening of cortical SEP during cross-clamping of the internal carotid artery. A stable rSO2 value just before cross-clamping and the lowest value after cross-clamping were registered, and the decrease was calculated. A statistically significant (P<0.01) decrease of rSO2 after cross-clamping could be found in patients without (64.9+/-8.3% to 60.9+/-9.9%) as well as in patients with consecutive loss of cortical SEP (65.8+/-9.1% to 56.1+/-13.4%). The difference of the decrease of rSO2 in both groups was highly significant (6.9+/-9.0% versus 15.6+/-14.0%; P<0.001). However, substantial interindividual variability of rSO2 and derived change of rSO2 did not allow the definition of a threshold value indicating need of shunt placement. The reliability of SEP for the detection of clamp-related hypoperfusion has been reaffirmed. As long as rSO2 threshold values indicating critical cerebral ischemia are not defined, therapeutic interventions based on monitoring with the cerebral oximeter INVOS 3100A are not justified.},

Venous oxygen saturations represent this relationship between oxygen delivery and oxygen demand and can therefore be used as an additional parameter to detect an impaired cardiorespiratory reserve. Before appropriate use of venous oxygen saturations, however, one should be aware of the physiology. Although venous oxygen saturation has been the subject of research for many years, increasing interest arose especially in the past decade for its use as a therapeutic goal in critically ill patients and during the perioperative period. Also, there has been debate on differences between mixed and central venous oxygen saturation and their interchangeability. Both mixed and central venous oxygen saturation are clinically useful but both variables should be used with insightful knowledge and caution. In general, low values warn the clinician about cardiocirculatory or metabolic impairment and should urge further diagnostics and appropriate action, whereas normal or high values do not rule out persistent tissue hypoxia. The use of venous oxygen saturations seems especially useful in the early phase of disease or injury. Whether venous oxygen saturations should be measured continuously remains unclear. Especially, continuous measurement of central venous oxygen saturation as part of the treatment protocol has been shown a valuable strategy in the emergency department and in cardiac surgery. In clinical practice, venous oxygen saturations should always be used in combination with vital signs and other relevant endpoints.},

Furthermore, we evaluated the feasibility of the optimisation algorithm used. We randomized 50 high-risk patients, all >65 years with ASA physical status III, who underwent major abdominal surgery under standardized balanced general anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia. Throughout surgery StO2 was monitored at the thenar eminence using near-infrared spectroscopy. All patients were treated according to a standard care algorithm. In addition, patients in the intervention group were treated with dobutamine if necessary to keep or raise StO2 ≥ 80%. Data were recorded continuously and complications were recorded during hospital stay with a maximum of 28 days. The number of complications was not significantly different between groups (11 vs 20; p = 0.23). Eleven patients in the intervention group had no complication, versus 7 in the control group. There was no significant difference between groups in length of stay in ICU or in hospital. Only ten patients in the intervention group received dobutamine. Administration of dobutamine resulted in a moderate 6 [-3 to 10] % increase of StO2. The overall protocol adherence was 94%. No statistically significant difference in outcome was realized through intraoperative optimization of StO2 values in this pilot study. The protocol used may be considered feasible for clinical practice. Further research is obligatory to define both the optimal StO2 threshold and intervention to treat tissue hypoperfusion.

Uniquely, three well-defined morphologies of the lipoplex were observed upon gradual acidification: a lamellar phase, a condensed lamellar phase, and an inverted hexagonal (H(II)) columnar phase. Using molecular modeling, we link the observed lipoplex morphologies and physical behavior to specific structural features in the individual surfactant, illuminating key factors in future surfactant design, viz., a spacer of six methylene groups, the presence of two nitrogens that can be protonated in the physiological pH range, two unsaturated alkyl tails, and hydrophilic sugar headgroups. Assuming that the mechanism of transfection by synthetic cationic surfactants involves endocytosis, we contend that the efficacy of gemini surfactant 1 as a gene delivery vehicle can be explained by the unprecedented observation of a pH-induced formation of the inverted hexagonal phase of the lipoplex in the endosomal pH range. This change in morphology leads to destabilization of the endosome through fusion of the lipoplex with the endosomal wall, resulting in release of DNA into the cytoplasm.},

  abstract = {Learning health systems (LHSs) are systems that seamlessly embed continuous quality improvement based on real-world data. To establish LHSs, several infrastructures need to be in place. Registries already have part(s) of this infrastructure and could therefore be leveraged to establish LHSs. This study aims to identify key factors facilitating the transition of registries into LHS to support continuous learning from real-world data. Eleven interviews with 12 stakeholders, including medical specialists and nonmedical stakeholders, were conducted in the context of a prostate cancer registry. Findings were coded deductively based on seven previously identified facilitators for learning: complexity, relative advantage, compatibility, credibility, social impact, actionability, and resource match. These facilitators cover technical, social, and organizational aspects. An inductive phase followed to pinpoint factors for continuous learning and LHSs. Subsequently, two focus groups were conducted to ensure accurate interpretation of findings, and five expert panels to provide additional context. Complexity within healthcare systems emerged as a significant challenge, attributed to multiple stakeholders and the rapidly changing healthcare landscape. The advantage of LHSs is the timely availability of population-based data for real-time care adjustments. Compatibility of the system with stakeholders' needs was considered pivotal requiring a relatively flexible infrastructure. Credibility of data and results was supported by creating transparent processes in which stakeholders could review data from their own patient population. Social influences, including interpersonal trust and engaged leadership, fostered collaboration within LHSs. Actionability of the findings and resource match were vital for knowledge translation and sustainability. Our findings provide practical recommendations to support registries in transitioning towards LHSs by leveraging and expanding their infrastructure for continuous learning. We identified technical, interpersonal, and organizational factors that facilitate continuous and rapid learning using real-world data, create transparent and collaborative infrastructures, and help to navigate the complexity of the healthcare system.},

  abstract = {Pathological cardiac remodeling is a maladaptive response that leads to changes in the size, structure, and function of the heart. These changes occur due to an acute or chronic stress on the heart and involve a complex interplay of hemodynamic, neurohormonal and molecular factors. As a critical regulator of cell growth, protein synthesis and autophagy mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is an important mediator of pathological cardiac remodeling. The tumor suppressor folliculin (FLCN) is part of the network regulating non-canonical mTORC1 activity. FLCN activates mTORC1 by functioning as a guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (GAP). Our work has identified a regulatory upstream open reading frame (uORF) localized in the 5'UTR of the FLCN mRNA. These small genetic elements are important regulators of protein expression. They are particularly important for the regulation of stress-responsive protein synthesis. We have studied the relevance of the FLCN uORF in the regulation of FLCN translation. We show that FLCN downregulation through the uORF is linked to cardiomyocyte growth and increased lysosomal activity. In summary, we have identified uORF-mediated control of RNA translation as another layer of regulation in the complex molecular network controlling cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.},

  abstract = {Multiple pregnancies are high risk pregnancies with higher chances of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. In the past decades the number of multiple pregnancies has increased. This trend is partly due to the fact that women start family planning at an increased age, but also due to the increased use of ART.Couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility generally receive intrauterine insemination IUI with controlled hormonal stimulation (IUI COH). The cumulative pregnancy rate is 40%, with a 10% multiple pregnancy rate.This study aims to reveal whether alternative treatments such as IVF elective Single Embryo Transfer (IVF e SET) or Modified Natural Cycle IVF (MNC IVF) can reduce the number of multiple pregnancy rates, but uphold similar pregnancy rates as IUI COH in couples with mild male or unexplained subfertility. Secondly, the aim is to perform a cost effective analyses and assess treatment preference of these couples. We plan a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of intra-uterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation or six cycles of Modified Natural Cycle (MNC) IVF or three cycles with IVF-elective Single Embryo Transfer (eSET) plus cryo-cycles within a time frame of 12 months.Couples with unexplained subfertility or mild male subfertility and a poor prognosis for treatment independent pregnancy will be included. Women with anovulatory cycles, severe endometriosis, double sided tubal pathology or serious endocrine illness will be excluded.Our primary outcome is the birth of a healthy singleton. Secondary outcomes are multiple pregnancy, treatment costs, and patient experiences in each treatment arm. The analysis will be performed according tot the intention to treat principle. We will test for non-inferiority of the three arms with respect to live birth. As we accept a 12.5% loss in pregnancy rate in one of the two IVF arms to prevent multiple pregnancies, we need 200 couples per arm (600 couples in total). Determining the safest and most cost-effective treatment will ensure optimal chances of pregnancy for subfertile couples with substantially diminished perinatal and maternal complications. Should patients find the most cost-effective treatment acceptable or even preferable, this could imply the need for a world wide shift in the primary treatment.

Bayesian adaptation of the PK model was applied at 60 min in the intervention group. Median (Absolute) Performance Error (Md(A)PE) was used to evaluate the difference between bias and inaccuracy of the models. Haemodynamic (mean arterial pressure [MAP], heart rate) and hypnotic (bispectral index [BIS]) stability was studied. The predictive performance of four alternative propofol PK models was studied. MdPE and MdAPE did not differ between groups during the pre-adjustment period (control group: 6.3% and 16%; intervention group: 5.4% and 18%). MdPE differed in the post-adjustment period (12% vs. -0.3%), but MdAPE did not (18% vs. 15%). No difference in heart rate, MAP or BIS was found. Compared with the other models, the Eleveld propofol PK model (patients) showed the best prediction performance. When an accurate population-based PK model was used for propofol TCI, Bayesian adaption of the model improved bias but not precision. Dutch Trial Registry NTR4518.},

  abstract = {Female fertility is an important trait in dairy cattle. Identifying putative causal variants associated with fertility may help to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction of fertility. Combining expression data (eQTL) of genes, exons, gene splicing and allele specific expression is a promising approach to fine map QTL to get closer to the causal mutations. Another approach is to identify genomic differences between cows selected for high and low fertility and a selection experiment in New Zealand has created exactly this resource. Our objective was to combine multiple types of expression data, fertility traits and allele frequency in high- (POS) and low-fertility (NEG) cows with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on calving interval in Australian cows to fine-map QTL associated with fertility in both Australia and New Zealand dairy cattle populations. Variants that were significantly associated with calving interval (CI) were strongly enriched for variants associated with gene, exon, gene splicing and allele-specific expression, indicating that there is substantial overlap between QTL associated with CI and eQTL. We identified 671 genes with significant differential expression between POS and NEG cows, with the largest fold change detected for the CCDC196 gene on chromosome 10. Our results provide numerous candidate genes associated with female fertility in dairy cattle, including GYS2 and TIGAR on chromosome 5 and SYT3 and HSD17B14 on chromosome 18. Multiple QTL regions were located in regions with large numbers of copy number variants (CNV). To identify the causal mutations for these variants, long read sequencing may be useful. Variants that were significantly associated with CI were highly enriched for eQTL. We detected 671 genes that were differentially expressed between POS and NEG cows. Several QTL detected for CI overlapped with eQTL, providing candidate genes for fertility in dairy cattle.},

Multiple genetic defects underlying SCN have been identified, but a genetic diagnosis is still lacking in a significant proportion of patients. Here, we report four independent pedigrees with heterozygous variants in LCP1. Variants c.740-1G>T and c.740-20_744del resulted in the same alternatively spliced RNA product, causing an in-frame deletion (p.A247_E254del). Variant c.509C>T in the third pedigree resulted in p.S170L, and variant c.806T>C in the fourth pedigree in p.L269P. Affected individuals suffer from neutropenia, poor or complete lack of response to G-CSF treatment, and variable degrees of lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, and monocytopenia. Patients with A247_E254del and p.L269P presented with tetraploid cells in the bone marrow, indicative of disturbed cytokinesis. In one of these kindreds, two individuals developed acute leukemia. G-CSF non-responsiveness and defective cell cycling were repaired upon correction of the LCP1 A247_E254del variant in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, supporting the monogenic origin of the disease. Indicative of their gain-of-function, both A247_E254del and S170L variants increased F-actin bundling and formation of abnormal protrusions. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of A247_E254del bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) showed deregulation of signaling pathways controlling mitosis in multi-lineage and lymphoid-primed HSPC subsets. We conclude that activating LCP1 variants cause a new hematopoietic disorder with autosomal dominant inheritance. Depending on the consequences of the LCP1 variants for protein structure, patients may suffer from G-CSF refractory severe neutropenia, lymphopenia, hypogammaglobulinemia, monocytopenia, and defective cytokinesis.},

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) from a voxel located in the basal ganglia revealed a decrease in N-acetylaspartate and myo-inositol peaks and an elevation of glutamine/ glutamate. The presence of spectroscopic abnormalities in a stable metabolic condition, in particular the rise in glutamine/ glutamate, indicates that the metabolic balance on cerebral parenchymal level is less optimal than estimated from biochemical analysis of urine, plasma, or cerebrospinal fluid.},

Intraoperative fluoroscopy views, including AP, elevated lateral and DTV were obtained. Intraoperative -screw- revision frequency for dorsal screw protrusion, screw position relative to volar plate and to dorsal compartment, and screw lengths were evaluated. Additional DTV led to a change of intraoperative management in 31 of 100 (31%) of patients. A total of 35 out of 504 screws (6.9%) were changed. Screws in the two most radial screws in the plate were at the highest risk of being revised; 16 (46%) screws in most radial position and nine (26%) screws in the 2nd from radial position were revised. Furthermore, five (14%) screws in both the 2nd from ulnar and most ulnar screw holes were revised after DTV. No screws were revised in the central hole. The median length of revised protruding screws was 22 mm (range, 12-26 mm), and these were changed to a mean length of 20  mm (range, 10-22 mm). In this prospective series of 100 patients, obtaining additional DTV is found to be efficacious as it led to change in intraoperative strategy in one-third of patients. We concur with previous pilot studies that DTV, after obtaining conventional AP and elevated lateral views, is advised to avoid dorsally protruding screws, which could minimise the potential for iatrogenic extensor tendon rupture after volar plating for distal radius fractures. Diagnostic accuracy of DTV is subject of a subsequent prospective cohort study with post-operative CT to serve as the reference standard. .Prognostic I.},

Cohort 1 was defined as patients treated with distal volar radius (DVR) plates during this period. Cohort 2 comprised 200 patients who had volar plate fixation with variable angle locking compression plates (LCP) during the same period.

In cohort 2, 63 plates (31.5%) were grade 0; 103 plates (51.5%) were grade 1; and 34 plates (17%) had grade 2 prominence on, and volar to, the watershed line.

  abstract = {In this cadaveric study of anterior plating of the distal radius, we aimed to determine the interobserver agreement and diagnostic performance for detecting dorsally protruding screws using the dorsal tangential radiographic view before and after specific training. Without prior instruction, 13 observers interpreted the dorsal tangential view of cadaveric specimens, in which anterior radial plates were placed. After seeing a training video on the dorsal tangential view, they repeated the task. Though we found that accuracy and interobserver agreement was lower than described in some other clinical series, training led to statistically significant improvements of (1) the interobserver agreement on the decision to exchange screws, (2) the self-confidence of the surgeon in obtaining adequate views, and (3) the number of fluoroscopic images required to obtain these views. After training, the number of protruding screws missed was reduced by 36%, but 7% of dorsally protruding screws was still missed.},

Multiplanar reconstructions of postoperative CTs allowed for detection and quantification of dorsal screw penetration using reproducible measuring techniques. Diagnostic performance (sensitivity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and accuracy) of DTV. Intraoperatively, in 16 of 50 patients (32%), screws were revised based on DTV, with 13 of 218 screws (6.0%) being revised due to dorsal prominence. One screw was changed because DTV showed it was in the distal radioulnar joint. Postoperatively, in 10 patients (20%), the computed tomography revealed 12 additional screws penetrating ≥1 mm with an average of 1.8 mm (range 1.0-4.5 mm). DTV had a sensitivity of 52%, a negative predictive value of 95%, and accuracy of 95%. No ≥1-mm protruding screw remained in the third compartment. In one-third of our patients, the incidence of protruding screws that can cause iatrogenic extensor tendon rupture was reduced by obtaining additional DTVs. Although DTV reduces the incidence of dorsal screw penetration considerably, this study reveals limited sensitivity. Therefore, one should keep in mind that dorsal screw penetration may go unnoticed on DTVs, and proper surgical technique remains paramount of DTV. Diagnostic Level II.

During an 18-month period, all adult patients that needed treatment for a unilateral inguinal or femoral hernia were treated by the TIPP repair using the Polysoft mesh. This group was retrospectively compared with a historical cohort of patients treated by the Lichtenstein technique. Our policy concerning type of anaesthesia, post-operative pain management and visual analogue scale measurements did not change over the study period. For post-operative pain evaluation, the visual analogue scale was used (0-10) and scores were measured after 6 h, 24 h, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year and yearly thereafter. Recurrence rates were evaluated at time of clinical examinations. In total, 142 patients have been analysed with the TIPP technique (group I) versus 136 patients operated in the previous 2 years with a Lichtenstein repair (group II). In group I, 112 patients (78.9%) received a medium size patch of 14 x 7.5 cm and 30 patients (21.1%) had a large patch (16 x 9 cm). The mean operative time for a TIPP procedure was statistically shorter than for a Lichtenstein repair, 33 versus 44 min, respectively (p = 0.04). After 24 h, 1 week and 1 month post-surgery, there was significantly less post-operative pain observed in the TIPP group than in the Lichtenstein group. In total, four recurrences were observed in the TIPP group (2.8%), of which one laterally and three medially. In group II, seven recurrences were observed in total (5.1%), of which five were detected within 2 years of follow-up (3.7%). For surgeons performing the Lichtenstein repair but looking for modifications concerning pain relief and a quicker procedure, the TIPP approach is a feasible alternative that seems to be associated with less post-operative pain.},

Description of the modified technical setup and retrospective analysis of the feasibility of the RCA-protocol for TPE in all patients treated between 2009 and 2010. 411 consecutive TPE with RCA were performed in 42 patients, all using FFP as replacement fluid. Median procedure characteristics were: blood flow 160 ml/min, filtrate flow 36 ml/min, duration 93 min, processed total plasma volume 3600 mL. Trisodium citrate was infused at a rate of 0.43 mmol/min to achieve post-filter ionized calcium levels of <0.4 mmol/l. Calcium substitution rate was 0.19 mmol/min to maintain physiologic iCa levels. RCA was well tolerated with no significant differences in pH, iCa, bicarbonate or potassium after repeated sessions. Clotting events complicated 7.3% of the procedures. Adverse events occurred in 3.4% of TPE procedures; none was severe or fatal. No significant differences were observed comparing the rate of adverse events to those observed in TPE using standard anticoagulation at our center (4.8%). We describe for the first time a modified protocol for RCA in TPE using an integrated citrate module.

Here, we reported that biallelic loss of SEC24C leads to a syndrome characterized by primary microcephaly, brain anomalies, epilepsy, hearing loss, liver dysfunction, anemia, and cataracts in an extended consanguineous family with 4 affected individuals. We showed that knockout of sec24C in zebrafish recapitulated important aspects of the human phenotype. SEC24C-deficient fibroblasts displayed alterations in the expression of several COPII components as well as impaired anterograde trafficking to the Golgi, indicating a severe impact on COPII function. Transcriptome analysis revealed that SEC24C deficiency also affected the proteasome and autophagy pathways. Moreover, a shift in the N-glycosylation pattern and deregulation of the N-glycosylation pathway suggested a possible secondary alteration of protein glycosylation, linking the described disorder with the congenital disorders of glycosylation.},

This difference was mainly driven by the 2-dose schedule for HIV patients in 2009/10. Vitamin D levels were lower in HIV patients but did not correlate with immune response. HIV-infected patients who had received 1 or 2 doses of an adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine in the previous year (2009/10) had a significant higher seroconversion rate following TIV as compared to healthy controls, indicating a stronger memory cell response due to the 2-dose schedule.},

From 2010 to 2020, our center evaluated 997 patients presenting with infertility and normozoospermia. All patients underwent comprehensive assessments, including physical examinations, testicular sonography, blood tests, follice-stimulating hormone beta (FSHB) c.-211 variants, and semen analyses. For comparative purposes, we established two control groups: one comprising healthy men participating in the FAMe study (n = 201) and another consisting of men seeking fertility restoration following vasectomy (n = 75). Within the infertile male group, we further stratified patients into those with primary or secondary infertility. Analysis of patient histories revealed a significantly elevated prevalence of genital malformations (e.g., hypospadias (p = 0.024) and undescended testes during childhood (p < 0.001) in our infertile group relative to the control group. By anamnesis we could find significant more patients with erectile dysfunction (p < 0.001) in our infertile men. The physical examination showed significant more patients with obesity in our infertility group (p < 0.001). Regarding hormonal profiles, a notably higher proportion of patients in the infertility group exhibited hypogonadism (p < 0.001), while compensated hypogonadism was more common in the control group. Reduced serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations in men with the FSHB c.-211 GT/TT polymorphism versus the GG wildtype were only present in the infertile but not the fertile cohort (p < 0.001). Evaluation of ejaculate samples indicated a significant increase in round cells (p < 0.001) and leukocytes (p = 0.013) in our infertile patients compared to the healthy subjects. The assessment of men presenting with infertility and normozoospermia unveiled a marked prevalence of physical and genetic findings. This underscores the critical need for andrological evaluations to prevent potential long-term consequences. The andrological examination of normozoospermic and infertile men promises better health outcomes for the patients as well as it aids in refining fertility treatment options for their female counterparts.},

While developing a transducible zinc finger protein-based artificial transcription factor targeting the expression of endothelin receptor A, we identified interaction between the CPP and the endosomal membrane or endosomal entanglement as a main culprit for endosomal entrapment. To achieve endosomal disentanglement, we utilized endosome-resident proteases to sever the artificial transcription factor from its CPP upon arrival inside the endosome. Using this approach, we greatly enhanced the correct subcellular localization of the disentangled artificial transcription factor, significantly increasing its biological activity and distribution in vivo. With rational engineering of proteolytic sensitivity, we propose a new design principle for transducible therapeutic proteins, helping CPPs attain their full potential as delivery vectors for therapeutic proteins.},

In patients, ATD led to attenuated FC of the right superior premotor cortex (BA 6) with the DMN, comparable to the extent found in controls after BAL administration. ATD lowered FC of the left somatosensory cortex (BA 3) with the DMN, independently of the factor group, but with stronger effects in controls. Data reveal a serotonergic modulation of FC between BA 6 and 3, known to be relevant for motor planning and sensory perception, and the DMN, thereby possibly pointing toward ATD acting beneficially on neural planning of motor activity in patients with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Closure of the ductus arteriosus (DA) at birth is essential for the transition from fetal to postnatal life. Before birth the DA bypasses the uninflated lungs by shunting blood from the pulmonary trunk into the systemic circulation. The molecular mechanism underlying DA closure and degeneration has not been fully elucidated, but is associated with apoptosis and cytolytic necrosis in the inner media and intima. We detected features of histology during DA degeneration that are comparable to Hutchinson Gilford Progeria syndrome and ageing. Immunohistochemistry on human fetal and neonatal DA, and aorta showed that lamin A/C was expressed in all layers of the vessel wall. As a novel finding we report that progerin, a splicing variant of lamin A/C was expressed almost selectively in the normal closing neonatal DA, from which we hypothesized that progerin is involved in DA closure. Progerin was detected in 16.2%±7.2 cells of the DA. Progerin-expressing cells were predominantly located in intima and inner media where cytolytic necrosis accompanied by apoptosis will develop. Concomitantly we found loss of α-smooth muscle actin as well as reduced lamin A/C expression compared to the fetal and non-closing DA. In cells of the adjacent aorta, that remains patent, progerin expression was only sporadically detected in 2.5%±1.5 of the cells. Data were substantiated by the detection of mRNA of progerin in the neonatal DA but not in the aorta, by PCR and sequencing analysis. The fetal DA and the non-closing persistent DA did not present with progerin expressing cells. Our analysis revealed that the spatiotemporal expression of lamin A/C and progerin in the neonatal DA was mutually exclusive. We suggest that activation of LMNA alternative splicing is involved in vascular remodeling in the circulatory system during normal neonatal DA closure.},

ROTA.shock was a 1:1 randomized, prospective, double-arm multi-center non-inferiority trial that compared the use of IVL and RA with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in severely calcified lesions. In 19 of the patients out of this study CNs were detected by OCT in the target lesion and were treated by either IVL or RA. The mean angle of CNs was significantly larger in final OCT scans than before RA (92 ± 17° vs. 68 ± 7°; p = 0.01) and IVL (89 ± 18° vs. 60 ± 10°; p = 0.03). The CNs were thinner upon final scans than in initial native scans (RA: 17.8 ± 7.8 mm vs. 38.6 ± 13.1 mm; p = 0.02; IVL: 16.5 ± 9.0 mm vs. 37.2 ± 14.3 mm; p = 0.02). Nodule volume did not differ significantly between native and final OCT scans (RA: 0.66 ± 0.12 mm RA or IVL are unable to reduce the volume of the calcified plaque.

  abstract = {In glycoanalysis protocols, N-glycans from glycoproteins are most frequently released with peptide- N (4)-( N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F (PNGase F). As the enzyme is an amidase, it cleaves the NH-CO linkage between the Asn side chain and the Asn-bound GlcNAc residue. Usually, the enzyme has a low activity, or is not active at all, on native glycoproteins. A typical example is native bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B (RNase B) with oligomannose-type N-glycans at Asn-34. However, native RNase BS, generated by subtilisin digestion of native RNase B, which comprises amino acid residues 21-124 of RNase B, is sensitive to PNGase F digestion. The same holds for carboxymethylated RNase B (RNase B (cm)). In this study, NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling have been used to explain the differences in PNGase F activity for native RNase B, native RNase BS, and RNase B (cm). NMR analysis combined with literature data clearly indicated that the N-glycan at Asn-34 is more mobile in RNase BS than in RNase B. MD simulations showed that the region around Asn-34 in RNase B is not very flexible, whereby the alpha-helix of the amino acid residues 1-20 has a stabilizing effect. In RNase BS, the alpha-helix formed by amino acid residues 23-32 is significantly more flexible. Using these data, the possibilities for complex formation of both RNase B and RNase BS with PNGase F were studied, and a model for the RNase BS-PNGase F complex is proposed.},

With the aim to generate biologically active 15N-labeled glycohormones for conformational studies focused on the unravelling of the NMR structures in solution, the P. pastoris strains GS115 and X-33 were explored for the expression of human chorionic gonadotropin (phCG) and human follicle-stimulating hormone (phFSH). In agreement with recent investigations on the N-glycosylation of phCG, produced in P. pastoris GS115, using ammonia/glycerol-methanol as nitrogen/carbon sources, the N-glycosylation pattern of phCG, synthesized using NH4Cl/glucose-glycerol-methanol, comprised neutral and charged, phosphorylated high-mannose-type N-glycans (Man8-15GlcNAc2). However, the changed culturing protocol led to much higher amounts of glycoprotein material, which is of importance for an economical realistic approach of the aimed NMR research. In the context of these studies, attention was also paid to the site specific N-glycosylation in phCG produced in P. pastoris GS115. In contrast to the rather simple N-glycosylation pattern of phCG expressed in the GS115 strain, phCG and phFSH expressed in the X-33 strain revealed, besides neutral high-mannose-type N-glycans, also high concentrations of neutral hypermannose-type N-glycans (Manup-to-30GlcNAc2). The latter finding made the X-33 strain not very suitable for generating 15N-labeled material. Therefore, 15N-phCG was expressed in the GS115 strain using the new optimized protocol. The 15N-enrichment was evaluated by 15N-HSQC NMR spectroscopy and GLC-EI/MS. Circular dichroism studies indicated that 15N-phCG/GS115 had the same folding as urinary hCG. Furthermore, 15N-phCG/GS115 was found to be similar to the unlabeled protein in every respect as judged by radioimmunoassay, radioreceptor assays, and in vitro bioassays.},

A single-center retrospective descriptive study was performed. All patients with LRYGBP from 2011 till April 2017 were included. An antecolic technique was used with closure of the mesenteric defect with a non-absorbable running suture between 2011 and October 2013 (group A), and from November 2013, we added closure of the Petersen defect (group B). From a total of 3124 patients, 116 patients (3.71%) had an exploratory laparoscopy due to suspicion of bowel obstruction, but in only 67 (2.14%) patients, an IH was found. Preoperative CT predicted the diagnosis in only 73%. In group A, including 1586 patients, 53 (3.34%) were diagnosed with an internal hernia: 39 at Petersen's space and 14 at the mesenteric defect. The mean time interval was 24.2 months and the mean BMI 25.7 kg/m After descriptive analysis, these results can provide strong recommendation of closure of the mesenteric defect and Petersen's space, as we notice a tendency to lower incidence of internal hernias.},

In ulcerative colitis, hypercoagulation is presumed, which may explain part of the clinical features of this disease. Therapy strategies affecting hemostasis may improve the course of ulcerative colitis. This study was conducted to evaluate the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis in the course of treatment of active ulcerative colitis. Patients with active ulcerative colitis were studied by serial determination of markers of the coagulation cascade (thrombin-antithrombin complexes and fibrin degradation products [FbDP]) and the fibrinolytic cascade (fibrinogen degradation products [FgDP]). Parameters of inflammation were also measured (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], albumin, platelet count, and fibrinogen). Disease activity was assessed by endoscopic and histopathological scores. Follow-up measurement was performed in the course of treatment at the third or fourth month after baseline. Measurements were compared with healthy controls. Thirty-three patients and 22 healthy controls were included. During active ulcerative colitis, inflammatory parameters (CRP, ESR, platelet count) and hemostatic parameters (thrombin-antithrombin complexes, fibrinogen, FgDP, and FbDP) were elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Albumin was decreased and antithrombin-III remained unchanged. During treatment, disease activity decreased significantly endoscopically and histopathologically (p < 0.001). CRP, ESR, platelet count, and fibrinogen also decreased significantly. The hemostatic balance, expressed as the ratio between the plasmin-dependent generation of FgDP and coagulation-dependent generation of FbDP, increased from 0.69 to 1.12 during treatment, mainly because of a decrease of FbDP. In healthy controls, this ratio was The coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades were activated in active ulcerative colitis, with a hemostatic imbalance in favor of coagulation. This hypercoagulability persisted in 20% (7/33) of patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. The decrease of FbDP and the increase in the FgDP/FbDP ratio during reconvalescence of ulcerative colitis showed that the coagulation cascade was more activated than the fibrinolytic cascade in active disease.},

We studied longitudinally inflammatory and haemostatic parameters in patients treated for severe ulcerative colitis. We carried out a descriptive study of longitudinal blood measurements in patients with severe ulcerative colitis from one large regional hospital. Nineteen patients with severe ulcerative colitis were assessed by an endoscopic score and a patient score at baseline. Patients were assessed by patient scores during treatment at scheduled intervals. At each visit, inflammatory and haemostatic parameters were determined. At baseline, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, leucocyte and granulocyte count, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, prothrombin fragment 1+2, fibrinogen and degradation products of fibrinogen and fibrin were increased in patients when compared with controls, whereas albumin concentration and factor XIII activity were significantly lower. Antithrombin activity was normal. During treatment, the median patient score diminished significantly from 12 to 4.5 points after 2 weeks, decreased further to 4 points after 4 weeks and remained below 4 points throughout the remaining study period. Inflammation parameters returned to within the reference range in two patients after 4 weeks, whereas the coagulation markers prothrombin fragment 1+2 and thrombin-antithrombin complexes returned to normal values after 8 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. In contrast with markers of inflammation, slightly increased concentrations of the degradation products of both fibrinogen and fibrin were found for almost 1 year, which indicated low-grade activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. These results are compatible with a condition of persistent hypercoagulation in patients with ulcerative colitis who are in clinical remission. Persistent hypercoagulation may contribute to the clinical course of ulcerative colitis.},

Data on efficient pharmacotherapy for SQT1 are scarce. In patients with primary carnitine-deficiency, acquired-short QT syndrome (SQTS) has been observed and rescued by carnitine supplementation. Here, we assessed whether carnitine exerts direct beneficial (prolonging) effects on cardiac repolarization in genetic SQTS. Adult wild-type (WT) and transgenic SQT1 rabbits (HERG-N588K, gain of IKr) were used. In vivo electrocardiograms (ECGs), ex vivo monophasic action potentials (APs) in Langendorff-perfused hearts, and cellular ventricular APs and ion currents were assessed at baseline and during L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine-perfusion. Two-dimensional computer simulations were performed to assess re-entry-based ventricular tachycardia-inducibility. L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine prolonged QT-intervals in WT and SQT1, leading to QT-normalization in SQT1. Similarly, monophasic and cellular AP duration (APD) was prolonged by L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine in WT and SQT1. As underlying mechanisms, we identified acute effects on the main repolarizing ion currents: IKr-steady, which is pathologically increased in SQT1, was reduced by L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine and deactivation kinetics were accelerated. Moreover, L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine decreased IKs-steady and IK1. In silico modelling identified IKr changes as the main factor for L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine-induced APD-prolongation. 2D simulations revealed increased sustained re-entry-based arrhythmia formation in SQT1 compared to WT, which was decreased to the WT-level when adding carnitine-induced ion current changes. L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine prolong/normalize QT and whole-heart/cellular APD in SQT1 rabbits. These beneficial effects are mediated by acute effects on IKr.

  abstract = {Hygienic healthcare standards are essential for avoiding hospital infections. However, medical students and staff lack training in this field, which may be due to high personnel resources of present educational approaches. Thus, there is an urgent need for a novel and efficient approach. Aim of the study is to compare a newly developed video-assisted peer feedback (VAPF) method for teaching wound dressings to the traditional teaching method with qualified instructor feedback (QIF) with respect to essential learning outcomes. In this randomized controlled noninferiority trial, 251 medical undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of two interventions (QIF n = 127; VAPF n = 124). In QIF, participants received feedback from a qualified instructor. In VAPF, participants video-recorded each other while performing a wound dressing and gave each other feedback assisted by a standardized checklist. Outcome measures were participants' score in an objective structured practical examination (OSPE) and a written exam after the course. Noninferiority of VAPF (n = 123) compared to QIF (n = 127) was confirmed for both OSPE (QIF: 8.83 ± 1.30; VAPF: 8.88 ± 1.04; mean difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.25) and written exam (QIF: 8.99 ± 1.06; VAPF: 9.14 ± 1.05; mean difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.12). VAPF is a cost-efficient and viable alternative to QIF commonly used in medical education. It provides comparable training outcomes to the traditional training method with lower personnel investment. VAPF is a promising educational method for improving essential clinical competencies.},

  abstract = {Perioperative goal-directed therapy is considered to improve patient outcomes after high-risk surgery. The association of compliance with perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols and postoperative outcomes is unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of protocol compliance on postoperative outcomes following high-risk surgery, after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol. Through a before-after study design, patients undergoing elective high-risk surgery before (before-group) and after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol (after-group) were included. Perioperative goal-directed therapy in the after-group consisted of optimized stroke volume variation or stroke volume index and optimized cardiac index. Additionally, the association of protocol compliance with postoperative complications when using perioperative goal-directed therapy was assessed. High protocol compliance was defined as ≥ 85% of the procedure time spent within the individual targets. The difference in complications during the first 30 postoperative days before and after implementation of the protocol was assessed. In the before-group, 214 patients were included and 193 patients in the after-group. The number of complications was higher in the before-group compared to the after-group (n = 414 vs. 282; p = 0.031). In the after-group, patients with high protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index had less complications compared to patients with low protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index (n = 187 vs. 90; p = 0.01). Protocol compliance by the attending clinicians is essential and should be monitored to facilitate an improvement in postoperative outcomes desired by the implementation of perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols.},

Activator E2Fs, E2F1-3, induce an upswing of E2F targets, which is essential for the G1-to-S phase transition, whereas atypical E2Fs, E2F7 and E2F8, mediate a downswing of the same targets during late S, G2, and M phases. Expression of atypical E2Fs is induced by E2F1-3, but it is unknown how atypical E2Fs are inactivated in a timely manner. Here, we demonstrate that E2F7 and E2F8 are substrates of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Removal of CDH1, or mutating the CDH1-interacting KEN boxes, stabilized E2F7/8 from anaphase onwards and during G1. Expressing KEN mutant E2F7 during G1 impairs S phase entry and eventually results in cell death. Furthermore, we show that E2F8, but not E2F7, interacts also with APC/C(C) (dc20). Importantly, atypical E2Fs can activate APC/C(C) (dh1) by repressing its inhibitors cyclin A, cyclin E, and Emi1. In conclusion, we discovered a feedback loop between atypical E2Fs and APC/C(C) (dh1), which ensures balanced expression of cell cycle genes and normal cell cycle progression.},

  abstract = {In problem-based learning, a tutor, the quality of the problems and group functioning play a central role in stimulating student learning. This study is conducted in a hybrid medical curriculum where problem-based learning is one of the pedagogical approaches. The aim of this study was to examine which tutor tasks are the most important during the tutorial sessions and thus should be promoted in hybrid (and in maybe all) problem-based learning curricula in higher education. A student (N = 333) questionnaire was used to obtain data about the problem-based learning process, combined with the achievement score of the students on a multiple-choice exam. Structural equation modeling was used to test the fit of different models (two existing models and a new simplified model) representing the factors of interest and their relationships, in order to determine which tutor characteristics are the most important in the present study. A new simplified model is presented, which demonstrates that stimulation of active and self-directed learning by tutors enhances the perceived case quality and the perceived group functioning. There was no significant effect between the stimulation of collaborative learning and perceived group functioning. In addition, group functioning was not a significant predictor for achievement. We found that stimulating active and self-directed learning are perceived as tutors' most important tasks with regard to perceived case quality and group functioning. It is necessary to train and teach tutors how they can stimulate active and self-directed learning by students.},

The contributions show current research in biomolecular NMR, spin hyperpolarisation and spin chemistry, including CIDNP (chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarisation), topics to which he has contributed enormously. His proposal of the radical pair mechanism was the birth of the field of spin chemistry, and the laser CIDNP NMR experiment on a protein was a major breakthrough in hyperpolarisation research. He set milestones for biomolecular NMR by developing computational methods for protein structure determination, including restrained molecular dynamics and 3D NMR methodology. With a lac repressor headpiece, he determined one of the first protein structures determined by NMR. His studies of the lac repressor provided the first examples of detailed studies of protein nucleic acid complexes by NMR. This deepened our understanding of protein DNA recognition and led to a molecular model for protein sliding along the DNA. Furthermore, he played a leading role in establishing the cluster of NMR large-scale facilities in Europe. This editorial gives an introduction to the publication and is followed by a biography describing his contributions to magnetic resonance.},

Meanwhile, modernist imaginaries of ordering 'unruly waters and humans' have become cornerstones of hydraulic-bureaucratic and capitalist development. They separate hydro/social worlds, sideline river-commons cultures, and deepen socio-environmental injustices. But myriad new water justice movements (NWJMs) proliferate: rooted, disruptive, transdisciplinary, multi-scalar coalitions that deploy alternative river-society ontologies, bridge South-North divides, and translate river-enlivening practices from local to global and vice-versa. This paper's framework conceptualizes 'riverhood' to engage with NWJMs and river commoning initiatives. We suggest four interrelated ontologies, situating river socionatures as arenas of material, social and symbolic co-production: 'river-as-ecosociety', 'river-as-territory', 'river-as-subject', and 'river-as-movement'.},

Earlier data suggested that impaired microcirculatory blood flow could be corrected with intravenous nitroglycerin in these patients. We tested this concept after fulfillment of preset systemic hemodynamic resuscitation end points in the early phase of sepsis. Prospective, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Closed-format 22-bed mixed intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients > or =18 yrs with sepsis, according to international criteria, and at least one early sign of organ dysfunction, as the principal reason for intensive care unit admission, were eligible for enrollment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive nitroglycerin (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35) after fulfillment of protocol-driven resuscitation end points. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00493415. Primary outcome was sublingual microcirculatory blood flow of small vessels, as assessed by side-stream dark field imaging. After protocolized resuscitation, we observed recruitment of sublingual microcirculation in both groups, as indicated by a significant improvement in the microcirculatory flow index after 24 hrs, in comparison to baseline. However, no difference in the sublingual microvascular flow index was observed between groups. The median microvascular flow index in sublingual small-sized vessels was 2.71 (1.85-3) in the nitroglycerin group and 2.71 (1.27-3), p = .80, in the placebo group. In medium-sized vessels, the respective values were 3 (2.75-3) vs. 2.86 (2.19-3), p = .21, and in large-sized vessels, 3 (3-3) vs. 3 (2.89-3), p = .06. In-hospital mortality, as a secondary outcome, was 34.3% in the nitroglycerin group and 14.2% in the placebo group, p = .09. In the context of a strict resuscitation protocol, based upon fulfillment of systemic hemodynamic end points in patients with early-phase severe sepsis or septic shock, we conclude that intravenous nitroglycerin does not promote sublingual microcirculatory blood flow.},

Previous studies revealed that the passive individuals are more prone to hyperinsulinemia. Likewise, we hypothesize that different coping styles may require different drugs to treat this. We tested this by treating passive and proactive rats (Roman Low Avoidance and Roman High Avoidance rats respectively) with either Rosiglitazone or with RU486. After eight days of treatment we performed and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and we compared the insulin and glucose levels with those measured during the IVGTT at baseline. Rosiglitazone improved insulin levels during an IVGTT in both passive and proactive coping styles. RU486, however, lowered insulin levels only in rats with a passive coping style. This study suggests that insight in the neuroendocrine differences between passive and proactive coping styles may provide an extra impulse to improve treatment of insulin resistance, since it allows the application of drugs targeted at the individual.},

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) has proven effective for preventing strokes associated with atrial fibrillation but is complicated by inherent bleeding risk and therapeutic compliance. Mechanical closure of the left atrial appendage seems an attractive alternative, especially in patients for whom long-term oral anticoagulation is not a good option. In the past decade, several percutaneous techniques have become available for this, including the WATCHMAN device. Randomized trials with the WATCHMAN device suggest that closure of the left atrial appendage is not inferior to oral anticoagulation in stroke prevention and that additionally there is reduced bleeding. Prospective registry studies of patients with contraindications for oral anticoagulation confirm that closure of the left atrial appendage is an attractive alternative to anticoagulation. Ongoing investigations are focused on reducing complications of the closure procedure, the lowest form of anticoagulation, comparing existing techniques and comparing left atrial appendage closure with direct oral anticoagulants.},

The QoL assessment using the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) Score of AF-related symptoms was collected at baseline and 12 months. In total, 1054 patients were included in this analysis (age 60.6, 67.6% male, 26.5% PersAF). Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom from AF recurrence was 77.7% at 12 months. Peri-procedural device or procedure-related complications were observed in 26 (2.5%) patients, with a low stroke rate of 0.3%. One-year post-ablation, the EHRA AF Symptom score decreased in 68% of patients. The AFEQT score improvement was observed in 88.4% and 90.4% of patients who completed the questionnaire in-person or interviewed by phone at 12 month follow-up, respectively. Phased RF ablation for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent AF demonstrated a 77.7% freedom from AF recurrence at 12 months in addition to a significant reduction in arrhythmia symptoms and clinically meaningful improved QoL. Low peri-procedural complication rate of <3% was reported.},

Beyond assessing image quality, we investigate the model's capacity for generalization by analyzing its performance across diverse patient subgroups, considering factors such as sex, age, and anatomical region.

Prolonged immobilization, biochemical factors and hemodynamic instability have been discussed as factors in the pathogenesis of this devastating complication. Perioperative visual loss in four consecutive patients, all featuring Flammer syndrome, is reported herein. To our knowledge, we present the first case series, which associates perioperative visual loss with Flammer syndrome. We assume that a low perfusion pressure, disturbed autoregulation of the ocular blood flow and altered drug sensitivity in such subjects, play significant role in the pathogenesis of this dreaded complication. We analysed the medical records of four consecutive patients with permanent perioperative visual loss and complemented our findings with additional history taking and clinical examinations. A variety of tests was performed, including colour Doppler ultrasonography of the retroocular vessels, static and dynamic retinal vessel analysis. The visual loss was unilateral in three patients and bilateral in one. An extensive review of published perioperative vision loss cases was conducted. All four patients were male Caucasians, and exhibited prominent signs and symptoms of Flammer syndrome. The visual loss originated from a propensity for unstable ocular blood flow, combined with hyperreactivity toward pharmacological stimuli, leading together to disturbed autoregulation of the blood supply, and subsequently - to ocular hypoxia. An identified intrinsic hypoperfusion diathesis was a crucial pathophysiologic link in all of the patients. Other, yet unknown systemic or local factors may also be involved in this process. A review of numerous publications of perioperative visual loss and our data, support our hypothesis for a novel pathophysiologic model and incorporate Flammer syndrome as a distinct risk factor for paradoxical visual loss, during nonocular and ocular surgeries, or invasive procedures. To prevent the complications produced by disturbed blood flow autoregulation in such patients, guidelines for screening and tailored preoperative approach are given.},

Its incidence is unknown, and the insidious and nonspecific nature of symptoms may contribute to considerable diagnostic delay. We conducted the current study to assess the incidence and clinicoradiologic characteristics of idiopathic RPF. For this, we evaluated prospectively 53 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic RPF at our tertiary care referral center from April 1998 through January 2008.Calculated annual incidence of RPF was 1.3/100,000 inhabitants. Mean age was 64 +/- 11.1 (SD) yr; male-female ratio was 3.3:1.0. Median duration of symptoms was 6.0 mo (IQR 3.0-12.0). Abdominal, flank, and/or back pain and discomfort were the major symptoms, with visual analogue scale scores of 49 +/- 27.2 mm and 43 +/- 29.4 mm for pain and discomfort, respectively. Female patients had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), higher white blood cell count, and lower hemoglobin content than male patients at presentation. Computed tomography-documented maximal mass thickness amounted to 35 +/- 16.6 mm; craniocaudal length amounted to 137 +/- 48.8 mm. RPF mass extension up to or above the level of the renal vessels was noted in 3 patients (6%). Six patients (11%) presented with atypical RPF localization and/or bulky mass. Localized lymphadenopathy adjacent to the RPF mass was observed frequently (25%). Patients with hydronephrosis (56%) presented earlier than patients without hydronephrosis, with higher creatinine and greater mass thickness but similar pain severity. Patients were typically at high cardiovascular risk with increased-often aneurysmal-infrarenal aortic diameter (25.0 mm, IQR 22.0-30.0). RPF mass distribution was similar in patients with or without aneurysmal dilation. Occupational asbestos exposure (20%) and asbestos-related pleural changes (17%) were frequent among males. Previous or concurrent chronic inflammatory disease and/or autoimmune disease was noted in 8 patients (15%). Multivariate analysis revealed an independent association of ESR values with severity of pain and discomfort. Smoking was independently associated with infrarenal aortic diameter.In summary, annual RPF incidence is higher than previously assumed. Age at diagnosis and male-female ratio seem to have changed over time. RPF typically affects patients at high cardiovascular risk, including increased aortic diameter. Clinical presentation is influenced by sex, severity of inflammation and presence of hydronephrosis. Prolonged asbestos exposure and asbestos-related pleural changes were frequent among males. Localized lymphadenopathy adjacent to the RPF mass occurs frequently and should not confuse RPF diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Damage to the brain can have disastrous and long-lasting consequences. The European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) is aware of the importance of taking good care of the brain, both of patients and of anaesthesia and intensive care unit (ICU) caregivers, and has organised a complete learning track on brain health to bring this concern to the attention of practitioners. This learning track included an online Focus Meeting on Brain Health (November 25, 2023). We here provide readers with a digest of the information that was delivered during that meeting in an opinion paper driven by the authors' own reading of the literature. It is divided according to the meeting's sessions, including how to improve the health of an injured brain, how to keep a young or old brain healthy, how to keep a healthy adult brain unimpaired, how monitoring can impact brain health in the operating room and in the intensive care unit, and how to keep the anaesthesia and ICU caregivers' brain healthy. Each part is a brief and focused summary. The main delivered messages are that the management of injured brain patients involves an adequate choice of sedation, adequate brain monitoring, and focused attention to specific points depending on the underlying pathology; that several measures can be undertaken to protect the brain of the very young needing anaesthesia; that it is possible to detect older patients at risk of postoperative neurocognitive disorders, and that dedicated perioperative management by a multidisciplinary expert team may improve their outcomes; that apparently healthy adult brains may suffer during anaesthesia; that the electroencephalogram may track peri-operative brain dysfunction, and that female patients should be given special care in this respect; that multimodal brain monitoring helps to detect pathological processes and to maintain brain homeostasis; and that burnout in anaesthesiologists can be effectively fought using personal, organisational, managerial and legal approaches.},

  abstract = {Cardioprotective signaling mediates antiapoptotic actions through multiple mechanisms including maintenance of mitochondrial integrity. Pim-1 kinase is an essential downstream effector of AKT-mediated cardioprotection but the mechanistic basis for maintenance of mitochondrial integrity by Pim-1 remains unexplored. This study details antiapoptotic actions responsible for enhanced cell survival in cardiomyocytes with elevated Pim-1 activity. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the cardioprotective kinase Pim-1 acts to inhibit cell death by preserving mitochondrial integrity in cardiomyocytes. A combination of biochemical, molecular, and microscopic analyses demonstrate beneficial effects of Pim-1 on mitochondrial integrity. Pim-1 protein level increases in the mitochondrial fraction with a corresponding decrease in the cytosolic fraction of myocardial lysates from hearts subjected to 30 minutes of ischemia followed by 30 minutes of reperfusion. Cardiac-specific overexpression of Pim-1 results in higher levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 compared to samples from normal hearts. In response to oxidative stress challenge, Pim-1 preserves the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Ultrastructure of the mitochondria is maintained by Pim-1 activity, which prevents swelling induced by calcium overload. Finally, mitochondria isolated from hearts created with cardiac-specific overexpression of Pim-1 show inhibition of cytochrome c release triggered by a truncated form of proapoptotic Bid. Cardioprotective action of Pim-1 kinase includes preservation of mitochondrial integrity during cardiomyopathic challenge conditions, thereby raising the potential for Pim-1 kinase activation as a therapeutic interventional approach to inhibit cell death by antagonizing proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members that regulate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.},

Patients' platelets were tested directly. Diethyl-ether eluates of these platelets and patients' sera were tested indirectly with normal donor platelets. When all three tests were considered, positive results were obtained for 92.0% of the ITP patients with a platelet count of less than 150 X 10(9)/l and for 98.4% of the patients with a count of less than 100 X 10(9)/l. However, for many patients rather weak test results were obtained, with a score of 1/2-1 in 59.8% of the patients. Most patients (94.1%) with a positive direct test had a positive indirect test on the eluate. Thus, platelet-bound antibodies but not platelet-bound immune complexes were present in most, if not all, patients. Positive immunofluorescence tests were obtained for many patients with a diagnosis other than ITP. This resulted in a low specificity of the test for the diagnosis of ITP, evidently because autoimmune thrombocytopenia occurred together with many other diseases and also because antibodies against platelet cryptantigens (expressed by the action of EDTA or by platelet fixation) were present in many patients.},

  abstract = {At least a third of patients with a colorectal carcinoma who are candidate for surgery, are anaemic preoperatively. Preoperative anaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In general practice, little attention is paid to these anaemic patients. Some will have oral iron prescribed others not. The waiting period prior to elective colorectal surgery could be used to optimize a patients' physiological status. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of preoperative intravenous iron supplementation in comparison with the standard preoperative oral supplementation in anaemic patients with colorectal cancer. In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, patients with an M0-staged colorectal carcinoma who are scheduled for curative resection and with a proven iron deficiency anaemia are eligible for inclusion. Main exclusion criteria are palliative surgery, metastatic disease, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (5 × 5 Gy = no exclusion) and the use of Recombinant Human Erythropoietin within three months before inclusion or a blood transfusion within a month before inclusion. Primary endpoint is the percentage of patients that achieve normalisation of the haemoglobin level between the start of the treatment and the day of admission for surgery. This study is a superiority trial, hypothesizing a greater proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint in favour of iron infusion compared to oral supplementation. A total of 198 patients will be randomized to either ferric(III)carboxymaltose infusion in the intervention arm or ferrofumarate in the control arm. This study will be performed in ten centres nationwide and one centre in Ireland. This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of preoperative iron supplementation in exclusively anaemic patients with a colorectal carcinoma. Our trial hypotheses a more profound haemoglobin increase with intravenous iron which may contribute to a superior optimisation of the patient's condition and possibly a decrease in postoperative morbidity.

  abstract = {Haemodialysis (HD)-induced bio-incompatibility includes alterations in both cellular elements and humoral factors. As far as polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells are concerned, an increase in both adhesion and degranulation has been reported. However, whereas increased PMN adherence and aggregation is highly linked with early transient complement activation, degranulation seems a continuous process, independent from the formation of complement degradation products. In the process of cell activation, including PMN degranulation, divalent cations (Ca2+) appear to play a pivotal role. As regionally administering citrate creates an almost Ca(2+)-free environment within the dialyser, it is tempting to speculate that Ca2+ dependent phenomena of bio-incompatibility, originating within the dialyser, can be attenuated by substituting conventional heparin for citrate. Therefore, both anticoagulation modalities were compared in 10 stable patients, undergoing haemodialysis (HD) treatment with cellulose-triacetate membranes (CTA) only. Apart from the intracellular granule products myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoferrin (LF), the classical parameters of bio-incompatibility, peripheral blood neutropenia and complement activation, were measured. Analysis of MPO and LF gradients across the dialyser (concentration in efferent line-concentration in afferent line) suggested that degranulation is an early process, that occurs mainly within the extracorporeal circuit. Citrate abolished the release of MPO almost completely, whereas LF release was partially inhibited. Neither neutropenia, nor complement activation could be correlated with the occurrence of degranulation. HD-induced PMN degranulation seems largely independent from complement activation, but primarily reliant on Ca2+, at least in the case of CTA membranes.},

Glycoengineering also allows the construction of plants that are able to produce vaccines with custom-made N-glycan structures aiding the construction of vaccines that can be delivered to antigen-presenting cells in a target-oriented approach. The knowledge of innate immune receptors and their role in antigen uptake and presentation is rapidly increasing.

Moreover, the targeted manipulation of the plant N-glycosylation pathway allows the production of proteins carrying largely homogeneous, human-type oligosaccharides. These outstanding results have placed plants in a favourable position compared to other eukaryotic expression systems. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the N-glycosylation of plant-produced recombinant proteins, the possible impact of plant-specific N-glycans on the human immune system, and recent advances in engineering the plant N-glycosylation pathway towards the synthesis of (complex) human-type glycan structures, highlighting challenges and achievements in the application of these powerful technologies.},

  abstract = {Throughout life, fear learning is indispensable for survival and neural plasticity in the lateral amygdala underlies this learning and storage of fear memories. During development, properties of fear learning continue to change into adulthood, but currently little is known about changes in amygdala circuits that enable these behavioural transitions. In recordings from neurons in lateral amygdala brain slices from infant up to adult mice, we show that spontaneous and evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmissions mature into adolescence. At this time, increased inhibitory activity and signalling has the ability to restrict the function of excitation by presynaptic modulation, and may thus enable precise stimulus associations to limit fear generalization from adolescence onward. Our results provide a basis for addressing plasticity mechanisms that underlie altered fear behaviour in young animals. Convergent evidence suggests that plasticity in the lateral amygdala (LA) participates in acquisition and storage of fear memory. Sensory inputs from thalamic and cortical areas activate principal neurons and local GABAergic interneurons, which provide feed-forward inhibition that tightly controls LA activity and plasticity via pre- and postsynaptic GABAA and GABAB receptors. GABAergic control is also critical during fear expression, generalization and extinction in adult animals. During rodent development, properties of fear and extinction learning continue to change into early adulthood. Currently, few studies have assessed physiological changes in amygdala circuits that may enable these behavioural transitions. To obtain first insights, we investigated changes in spontaneous and sensory input-evoked inhibition onto LA principal neurons and then focused on GABAB receptor-mediated modulation of excitatory sensory inputs in infant, juvenile, adolescent and young adult mice. We found that spontaneous and sensory-evoked inhibition increased during development. Physiological changes were accompanied by changes in dendritic morphology. While GABAB heteroreceptors were functionally expressed on sensory afferents already early in development, they could only be physiologically recruited by sensory-evoked GABA release to mediate heterosynaptic inhibition from adolescence onward. Furthermore, we found GABAB -mediated tonic inhibition of sensory inputs by ambient GABA that also emerged in adolescence. The observed increase in GABAergic drive may be a substrate for providing modulatory GABA. Our data suggest that GABAB -mediated tonic and evoked presynaptic inhibition can suppress sensory input-driven excitation in the LA to enable precise stimulus associations and limit generalization of conditioned fear from adolescence onward.},

The factor year affected codling moth MFO-resistance level, particularly in the untreated orchards, highlighting the great influence of codling moth migration on the spread of resistance in field populations. Chemical treatments and adult flight were also very important but mating disruption technique showed no influence. The second adult flight showed the highest frequency, followed by the first flight and the third flight. In untreated orchards, there were no significant differences in the frequency of MFO-resistant individuals attracted by Combo and BioLure. Red septa lures baited with pear ester (DA) captured sufficient insects only in the first generation of 2010, obtaining a significantly lower proportion of MFO-resistant adults than Combo and BioLure. In the chemically treated orchards, in 2009 BioLure caught a significantly lower proportion of MFO-resistant adults than Combo during the first and third flight, and also than DA during the first flight. No significant differences were found between the lures or flights in 2010. These results cannot support the idea of a higher attractiveness of the pear ester for MFO-resistant adults in the field but do suggest a high influence of the response to the attractant depending on the management of the orchard, particularly with regard to the use of chemical insecticides.},

  abstract = {Optogenetic approaches are now widely used to study the function of neural populations and circuits by combining targeted expression of light-activated proteins and subsequent manipulation of neural activity by light. Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) are light-gated cation-channels and when fused to a fluorescent protein their expression allows for visualization and concurrent activation of specific cell types and their axonal projections in defined areas of the brain. Via stereotactic injection of viral vectors, ChR fusion proteins can be constitutively or conditionally expressed in specific cells of a defined brain region, and their axonal projections can subsequently be studied anatomically and functionally via ex vivo optogenetic activation in brain slices. This is of particular importance when aiming to understand synaptic properties of connections that could not be addressed with conventional electrical stimulation approaches, or in identifying novel afferent and efferent connectivity that was previously poorly understood. Here, a few examples illustrate how this technique can be applied to investigate these questions to elucidating fear-related circuits in the amygdala. The amygdala is a key region for acquisition and expression of fear, and storage of fear and emotional memories. Many lines of evidence suggest that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) participates in different aspects of fear acquisition and extinction, but its precise connectivity with the amygdala is just starting to be understood. First, it is shown how ex vivo optogenetic activation can be used to study aspects of synaptic communication between mPFC afferents and target cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Furthermore, it is illustrated how this ex vivo optogenetic approach can be applied to assess novel connectivity patterns using a group of GABAergic neurons in the amygdala, the paracapsular intercalated cell cluster (mpITC), as an example.},

Synergist bioassays were performed to determine the enzymatic mechanisms involved. The least active ingredients were methoxyfenozide, with 100% of the populations showing significantly lower mortality than the susceptible strain, and lambda-cyhalothrin, with very high resistance ratios (872.0 for the most resistant field population). Approximately 50% of the populations were resistant or tolerant to thiacloprid. By contrast, tebufenozide was very effective in all the field populations, as was chlorpyrifos-ethyl despite its widespread use during the last few years. Indoxacarb, spinosad and chlorantraniliprole also provided high efficacy, as did emamectin and spinetoram, which are not yet registered in Spain. The resistant Spanish codling moth populations can be controlled using new reduced-risk insecticides.

Its resistance to available insecticides has been widely reported. Chlorantraniliprole is an anthranilic diamide that was introduced in European countries in 2008-2009 and acts by activating the insect's ryanodine receptors. The aims of this study were to determine the baseline susceptibility of European populations of C. pomonella to chlorantraniliprole, to establish the discriminant concentrations (DC) to check the possible development of resistance, and to know the role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450) in the possible susceptibility decrease of field populations to the insecticide. Ten field populations from Spain along with others were used to calculate the baseline response of larvae to chlorantraniliprole incorporated into the diet. A pooled probit line was calculated, and three DC were established: 0.3 mg a.i./kg (close to the LC50), 1.0 mg a.i./kg (close to the LC90), and 10 mg a.i./kg diets (threefold the LC99). The DC were used to test the susceptibility of 27 field populations from France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, and Spain. The corrected mortality observed in all cases ranged within the expected interval, even with Spanish populations that showed between 12.1 and 100.0% of individuals with high P450 activity. However, the mortality caused by the DC0.3 decreased as the mean P450 activity increased. Field populations resistant to other insecticides were susceptible to chlorantraniliprole. The determined baseline codling moth susceptibility is a valuable reference for tracking possible future alterations in the efficacy of the insecticide.},

  abstract = {Implementation of the Dutch national bowel screening programme in 2014 led to an increased rate of detection of polyps. In general, polyps should be removed endoscopically. However, if the size and location of the polyp make endoscopic removal technically difficult, or if there is a suspicion for early (T1) cancer, surgery is the preferred method for removal. An increasing number of these patients are being treated with minimally invasive surgical procedures instead of segmental resection. The aim of this study was to assess the number of referrals for surgery and the type of surgery for polyps since the introduction of the Dutch national bowel screening programme. A retrospective cohort study was performed. Patients who underwent surgery for colorectal polyps between January 2012 and December 2017 were included. Patients with histologically proven carcinoma prior to surgery were excluded. Primary outcomes were the number and type of surgical procedures for polyps. A total of 164 patients were included. An annual increase in procedures for colorectal polyps was observed, from 18 patients in 2012 to 36 patients in 2017. All the procedures before implementation of the screening programme were segmental resections, and 58.8% of the patients underwent organ-preserving surgery after implementation of the screening. The overall complication rate of organ-preserving surgery was 16.3%, compared with 44.3% for segmental resections (P = 0.001). Overall, invasive colorectal cancer was encountered in 23.8% of cases. The number of referrals for surgical resection of colorectal polyps has doubled since the introduction of the Dutch national bowel screening programme with a substantial shift towards organ-preserving techniques.},

However, CAPRI-3 uses text mining (an artificial intelligence (AI) technology) for patient identification and data collection. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the reliability and efficiency of this AI-driven approach. CAPRI-3 is an observational retrospective multicenter cohort registry on metastatic prostate cancer. We tested the patient-identification algorithm and automated data extraction through manual validation of the same patients in two pilots in 2019 and 2022. Pilot one identified 2030 patients and pilot two 9464 patients. The negative predictive value of the algorithm was maximized to prevent false exclusions and reached 94.8%. The completeness and accuracy of the automated data extraction were 92.3% or higher, except for date fields and inaccessible data (images/pdf) (10-88.9%). Additional manual quality control took over 3 h less time per patient than the original fully manual CAPRI registry (105 vs. 300 min). The CAPRI-3 patient-identification algorithm is a sound replacement for excluding ineligible candidates. The AI-driven data extraction is largely accurate and complete, but manual quality control is needed for less reliable and inaccessible data. Overall, the AI-driven approach of the CAPRI-3 registry is reliable and timesaving.},

A toolbox which uses PyTorch's autodifferentiation for simultaneous optimization of RF and gradient waveforms is presented and its performance is evaluated. MR measurements were performed on a 9.4T MRI scanner using a 3D saturated single-shot turboFlash sequence for [Formula: see text] mapping. RF pulse simulation and optimization were done using a Python toolbox and a dedicated server. An RF- and Gradient pulse design toolbox was developed, including a cost function to balance different metrics and respect hardware and regulatory limits. Pulse performance was evaluated in GRE and MPRAGE imaging. Pulses for non-selective and for slab-selective excitation were designed. Universal pulses for non-selective excitation reduced the flip angle error to an NRMSE of (12.3±1.7)% relative to the targeted flip angle in simulations, compared to (42.0±1.4)% in CP mode. The tailored pulses performed best, resulting in a narrow flip angle distribution with NRMSE of (8.2±1.0)%. The tailored pulses could be created in only 66 s, making it feasible to design them during an experiment. A 90° pulse was designed as preparation pulse for a satTFL sequence and achieved a NRMSE of 7.1%. We showed that both MPRAGE and GRE imaging benefited from the pTx pulses created with our toolbox. The pTx pulse design toolbox can freely optimize gradient and pTx RF waveforms in a short time. This allows for tailoring high-quality pulses in just over a minute.},

In recent years consensus has been reached that treatment with a second ART should be avoided due to low response rates. The aim of this study was to investigate if new scientific insights led to changes in clinical daily practice in the Netherlands. Patients included in the Dutch CAPRI-3 prostate cancer registry, currently encompassing 19 hospitals, and treated with at least 1 ART (ie, abiraterone or enzalutamide) were included. Patients were stratified based on start date of first ART (ART1) according to standard of care between 2016-2017, 2018-2019 and 2020-2021. Second ART (ART2) was defined as either direct (ART1>ART2) or at any given time (any ART2). Between the first and last ART1 group, the prevalence of ART1>ART2 declined from 14.3% to 6.5% (P = .001) and the prevalence of any ART2 from 27.6% to 10.7% (P < .001). The decline was observed before recommendations were included in European guidelines. The use of other life-prolonging drugs (LPDs) after ART1 (ART1>LPD) increased. Patients who were selected for ART1>ART2 instead of ART1>LPD were older, less frequently treated with taxane-based chemotherapy for mHSPC and had a longer time to development of mCRPC. New scientific insights were incorporated into clinical daily practice, with a significant decline in in the prevalence of sequential ART treatment, even before recommendations were included in European guidelines.},

  abstract = {Well-being at work can be defined as "creating an environment to promote a state of contentment which allows an employee to flourish and achieve their full potential for the benefit of themselves and their organisation." In the health care context, well-being at work of nurses and doctors is important for good patient care. Moreover, it is strongly associated with individual- and organization-level consequences. Relevant literature presents models and concepts of physical, mental, and social well-being. This study uses the 6 elements of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model to interpret well-being at work (job demands, job resources, personal resources, leadership, well-being, and outcomes) as part of a Netherlands Federation of University Medical Hospitals program to find ways to improve and monitor health care professionals' well-being in Dutch hospitals. Many instruments exist to measure well-being at work in terms of population, setting, and other aspects. An overview of available and eligible instruments assessing and monitoring the well-being of nurses and doctors is currently missing. We will perform a scoping review aiming to provide an overview of validated instruments assessing and monitoring the well-being of nurses and doctors at work. We will perform a search of published literature in the following databases: Medline, Embase, and CINAHL. Studies will be eligible if they (1) assess well-being at work of nurses and doctors employed in hospitals; (2) describe an evaluation of an instrument or review an instrument; (3) measure well-being at work or aspects of well-being at work according to the elements of the JD-R model, and (4) were published in English from 2011 onwards. Title/abstract screening according to the eligibility criteria will be followed by full-text screening. Data extraction of included studies will be conducted by 3 reviewers independently. Reviewers will use standardized data extraction forms that include study characteristics, sample characteristics, measurement instrument details, and psychometric properties. The analysis will be descriptive. When synthesizing the data, a distinction will be made between comprehensive instruments and common instruments. This scoping review identifies instruments that have been developed and validated for monitoring the well-being of nurses and doctors at work. Studies were searched between September and December 2021 and screened between December 2021 and May 2022. A total of 739 studies were included. Timely screening of well-being at work may be beneficial for individual health care workers, the organization, and patients. There is often a substantial gap and mismatch between employer perceptions of well-being and well-being interventions. It is important to develop and implement suitable interventions adapted to the needs of nurses and doctors and their health or other problems. Well-being screening should be timely to gain insight into these needs and problems. Moreover, to determine the effectiveness of well-being interventions, measurement is mandatory. The results will be critical for organizations to select a monitoring instrument that best fits the needs of employees and organizations. DERR1-10.2196/43692.},

Instruments were categorised based on the JD-R model domains. Descriptive analysis and data visualisation were performed using Excel and Python. We included 1204 studies, reporting 986 unique instruments. We identified 32 comprehensive instruments suitable for broad health screening, measuring four or more of the JD-R model domains. Additionally, we identified instruments focusing on specific domains for targeted screening needs. Furthermore, we present frequently reported instruments assumed to be extensively evaluated, user-friendly, accessible and available in multiple languages. Health at work cannot be determined by a single instrument alone, underscoring the multidimensional nature of workplace health. Alternatively, organisations should select instruments based on domains most relevant and applicable to their context. This approach ensures a more comprehensive assessment of health at work.},

Mechanical fixation and boundary conditions of the gradient coil were altered in several ways at one site to study the impact of mechanical coupling with the magnet on the field perturbations. Vibrations, power deposition in the He bath, and field dynamics were characterized at 11.7 T with the third-order shim coils connected and disconnected inside the Faraday cage. For the same whole-body gradient coil design, all measurements differed greatly based on the third-order shim coil configuration (connected or not). Vibrations and gradient transfer function peaks could be affected by a factor of 2 or more, depending on the resonances. Disconnecting the third-order shim coils at 11.7 T also suppressed almost completely power deposition peaks at some frequencies. Third-order shim coil configurations can have major impact in gradient-magnet interactions with consequences on potential hardware damage, magnet heating, and image quality going beyond EPI acquisitions.},

Due to the lack of data on hippoboscids in Morocco, this study aimed to investigate the louse fly fauna of sheltered dogs in the country as well as the filarial nematodes they may harbor. Between April and November 2022, 230 sheltered dogs from four cities in Central Morocco were randomly examined as part of an entomological and epidemiological study on arthropod vectors and canine vector-borne pathogens. All visible louse flies on the domestic dogs were randomly collected and then morphologically and molecularly identified. DNA was subsequently extracted for screening of filarial nematodes. A total of 30 dogs (13.1%) were infested with 35 H. longipennis louse flies, consisting of 33 adults (10 males, 19 non-gravid females, and four gravid females) and two larvae. Two representative specimens were confirmed through DNA barcoding of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene. All fly pools (gravid females, non-gravid females, males, and larvae) tested negative for filarial nematodes in the 12S rRNA PCR. This study represents the first morphological and molecular characterization of H. longipennis flies in Morocco. Further national-scale investigations are needed to address gaps in the knowledge of unrecorded hippoboscid species and the pathogens of medical and veterinary importance that they may carry.},

Secondary outcome measures were traumatic findings on CT scan, neurosurgical intervention and adherence to the guideline. During the study and control periods, respectively 1063 and 1026 patients with MHI attended the emergency department of the study centre. During the study period a CT scan was carried out in 34.2% of patients, significantly more than in the control period 18.8%; p < 0.01). The percentage of admissions also increased from 13.8% to 18.2% (p = 0.01). The differences between the two periods were mainly in adults and in children aged 6 and older. There was no significant change in traumatic intracranial findings or neurosurgical interventions. Adherence to the guideline in regard to hospitalization (81.7% guideline adherence) and CT brain imaging (88.3% guideline adherence) was reasonably high. After introduction of the current MHI guideline in the Netherlands, percentages of both hospitalization and CT of cerebrum have increased significantly. It was expected that the guideline would result in decreases of this percentages. This increase does not seem to be related to more or serious head/brain injury.},

Median total physical activity ranged from 1545 (IQR: 853-2453) at T0 to 1710 (IQR: 960-2730) at T3 min/week. Household (495-600 min/week) and light-intensity (900-998 min/week) activities accrued the most minutes. Analyses showed a significant increase in total physical activity moderate-intensity to vigorous-intensity physical activity and work/commuting physical activity for all time points (T1-T3) compared with baseline (T0). Diagnosis, age, sex and body mass index had a significant effect on baseline total physical activity. Physical activity is highly diverse among adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. Understanding this diversity in physical activity can help improve physical activity promotion activities.},

Data of 1,256 adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases enrolled in the prospective cohort study Rehabilitation, Sports, and Active lifestyle (ReSpAct) were analyzed. Self-reported physical activity and four main psychosocial factors (i.e., self-efficacy, attitude, motivation, social support) were measured with questionnaires 3-6 weeks before discharge (T0) and 14 (T1), 33 (T2), and 52 (T3) weeks after discharge from rehabilitation. Hybrid multilevel regression models (corrected for age, sex, education level, diagnosis, counseling support) were used. Multivariable significant between-subject associations were found for self-efficacy (std β = .094; 95% CI [0.035, 0.153]) and intrinsic motivation (std β = .114; [0.036, 0.192]).

Monitoring physical activity levels is important to provide insight on how much and what types of activities people with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases engage in. This information can be used as input for interventions to promote a physically active lifestyle. Therefore, valid and reliable physical activity measurement instruments are needed. This scoping review aims 1) to provide a critical mapping of the existing literature and 2) directions for future research on measurement properties of device-based instruments assessing physical activity behavior in ambulant adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. Four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Embase) were systematically searched from 2015 to April 16 One hundred three of 21566 Studies were included. 55 Consumer-grade and 23 research-grade devices were studied on measurement properties, using 14 different physical activity outcomes, in 23 different physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. ActiGraph (n = 28) and Fitbit (n = 39) devices were most frequently studied. Steps (n = 68) was the most common used physical activity outcome. 97 studies determined validity, 11 studies reliability and 6 studies responsiveness. This scoping review shows a large variability in research on measurement properties of device-based instruments in ambulatory adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. The variability highlights a need for standardization of and consensus on research in this field. The review provides directions for future research.},

Mutations in epigenetic pathway functions are powerful tools to induce epigenetic variation. As an alternative approach, we investigated the potential of over-expressing an epigenetic function, using DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) for proof-of-concept. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MET1 controls maintenance of cytosine methylation at symmetrical CG positions. At some loci, which contain dense DNA methylation in CG- and non-CG context, loss of MET1 causes joint loss of all cytosines methylation marks. We find that over-expression of both catalytically active and inactive versions of MET1 stochastically generates new epi-alleles at loci encoding transposable elements, non-coding RNAs and proteins, which results for most loci in an increase in expression. Individual transformants share some common phenotypes and genes with altered gene expression. Altered expression states can be transmitted to the next generation, which does not require the continuous presence of the MET1 transgene. Long-term stability and epigenetic features differ for individual loci. Our data show that over-expression of MET1, and potentially of other genes encoding epigenetic factors, offers an alternative strategy to identify epigenetic target genes and to create novel epi-alleles.},

In CD patients gluten-derived peptides are presented to the immune system, which leads to a CD4+ T-cell mediated immune response and inflammation of the small intestine. However, not all gluten proteins contain T-cell stimulatory epitopes. Gluten proteins are encoded by multigene loci present on chromosomes 1 and 6 of the three different genomes of hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) (AABBDD). The effects of deleting individual gluten loci on both the level of T-cell stimulatory epitopes in the gluten proteome and the technological properties of the flour were analyzed using a set of deletion lines of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. The reduction of T-cell stimulatory epitopes was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies that recognize T-cell epitopes present in gluten proteins. The deletion lines were technologically tested with respect to dough mixing properties and dough rheology. The results show that removing the alpha-gliadin locus from the short arm of chromosome 6 of the D-genome (6DS) resulted in a significant decrease in the presence of T-cell stimulatory epitopes but also in a significant loss of technological properties. However, removing the omega-gliadin, gamma-gliadin, and LMW-GS loci from the short arm of chromosome 1 of the D-genome (1DS) removed T-cell stimulatory epitopes from the proteome while maintaining technological properties. The consequences of these data are discussed with regard to reducing the load of T-cell stimulatory epitopes in wheat, and to contributing to the design of CD-safe wheat varieties.},

Specific gluten peptides can be presented by antigen presenting cells to gluten-sensitive T-cell lymphocytes leading to CD. During the last decades, a significant increase has been observed in the prevalence of CD. This may partly be attributed to an increase in awareness and to improved diagnostic techniques, but increased wheat and gluten consumption is also considered a major cause. To analyze whether wheat breeding contributed to the increase of the prevalence of CD, we have compared the genetic diversity of gluten proteins for the presence of two CD epitopes (Glia-α9 and Glia-α20) in 36 modern European wheat varieties and in 50 landraces representing the wheat varieties grown up to around a century ago. Glia-α9 is a major (immunodominant) epitope that is recognized by the majority of CD patients. The minor Glia-α20 was included as a technical reference. Overall, the presence of the Glia-α9 epitope was higher in the modern varieties, whereas the presence of the Glia-α20 epitope was lower, as compared to the landraces. This suggests that modern wheat breeding practices may have led to an increased exposure to CD epitopes. On the other hand, some modern varieties and landraces have been identified that have relatively low contents of both epitopes. Such selected lines may serve as a start to breed wheat for the introduction of 'low CD toxic' as a new breeding trait. Large-scale culture and consumption of such varieties would considerably aid in decreasing the prevalence of CD.},

The collagen-binding domain of LAIR-1 is homologous to that of glycoprotein VI (GPVI), a collagen receptor crucial for platelet activation. Because LAIR-1 and GPVI also display overlapping collagen-binding specificities, a common structural basis for collagen recognition would appear likely. Therefore, it is crucial to gain insight into the molecular interaction of both receptors with their ligand to prevent unwanted cross-reactions during therapeutic intervention. We determined the crystal structure of LAIR-1 and mapped its collagen-binding site by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titrations and mutagenesis. Our data identify R59, E61, and W109 as key residues for collagen interaction. These residues are strictly conserved in LAIR-1 and GPVI alike; however, they are located outside the previously proposed GPVI collagen-binding site. Our data provide evidence for an unanticipated mechanism of collagen recognition common to LAIR-1 and GPVI. This fundamental insight will contribute to the exploration of specific means of intervention in collagen-induced signaling in immunity and hemostasis.},

Interventions combining mindfulness and behavioural techniques showed to be more effective than other interventions. However, this result should be interpreted with care due to possible overestimation of the subgroup analysis. No differences in effectiveness were found across assessment times, delivery modes or study designs.

The focus is on three key areas: personalized interactions, empathic communication, and sensory engagement. Personalized interactions ensure therapy is uniquely tailored to each patient' needs, fostering a sense of individual attention and care. Empathic communication involves understanding and responding effectively to patients' verbal and nonverbal cues, creating a supportive environment where patients feel genuinely heard. Sensory engagement utilizes the therapeutic environment's visual, olfactory, and auditory elements to create a calming, welcoming space conducive to healing and relaxation. Integrating these strategies aims to increase treatment effectiveness and improve therapist well-being by promoting a fulfilling and less stressful work environment. Through a comprehensive review of existing evidence, current practices and innovative approaches, this paper advocates for a holistic, patient-centered model of hand therapy that significantly improves treatment outcomes and enhances the overall therapeutic experience, ensuring it is both practical and compassionate.},

  abstract = {To determine if inequality in height between claws within each hindlimb of dairy cattle is a risk factor for the development of lameness and to determine the effect of preventive trimming of these claws on the subsequent risk of lameness. Cows (n=2,695) on three dairy farms in Canterbury, New Zealand, were examined and the height differential between their hind claws on each limb was measured. Cows were blocked by age, then breed and grouped by height differential, before being randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups. Cows in the control group were not trimmed, whilst cows in the treatment group were all trimmed according to the 'Dutch Trimming' method by an experienced foot trimmer. All subsequent clinical incidences of lameness were identified, recorded and classified according to five categories. The overall incidence of lameness, the effect of claw height differential on the incidence of lameness and the effect of trimming on the incidence of lameness were assessed using both GEE modelling and survival analysis. The incidence of lameness identified in any untrimmed hindlimb irrespective of diagnosis, measured at a limb level and assessing the first incidence of lameness only, was 10.0% for a 6-month period from November to drying off. The predominant lesion identified was white line disease (WLD; 7.9% incidence and 78.6% of all lameness). The overall incidence of hindlimb lameness measured at cow level for the same period was 14.5%. The risk of lameness was influenced by breed (p=0.016), age (p=0.002) and claw height differential (p=0.026). There were no significant interactions. The risk of lameness was lowest where the claw height differential was 0-2 mm. The incidence of lameness in the first 70 days following trimming was higher in older cows than in younger cows (p<0.001). Trimming did not affect lameness incidence (p=0.185). The Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that farm (p<0.001), trimming group (p=0.021); and age (p=0.021) significantly affected the median days to lameness in the first 70 days following trimming. Hind feet with lower height differentials between claws had a lower incidence of lameness. Trimming of these feet to remove the height differential did not reduce their overall incidence of lameness, but did increase days to first lameness.},

The study population comprised 681 neurocritically ill patients from a mixed neurosurgical and neurological intensive care unit. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was 8.4% (57/681). Overall incidence of AKI was 11.6% with 36 (45.6%) patients developing dialysis-requiring AKI. Sepsis was the main cause of AKI in nearly 50% of patients. Acute kidney injury and renal replacement therapy are independent predictors of worse outcome (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.704; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.867-7.350;  Acute kidney injury in neurocritical care has a high incidence and is a crucial risk factor for mortality independently of the underlying neurocritical condition. Sepsis is the main cause of AKI in this setting. Therefore, careful prevention of infectious complications and considering CKD in treatment decisions may lower the incidence of AKI and hereby improve outcome in neurocritical care.},

Clinical characteristics and patterns of drug abuse. Histopathologic alterations of the kidney. Hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, Sirius, and Congo Red stainings and immunoglobulin A immunohistochemistry of all cases; additional histochemical stainings or immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy in selected cases. Individuals were mostly white (99.2%), were male (82.2%), and had intravenous drug use (IVDU) (81.4%). Median age at death was 39 years and duration of drug abuse was 17 years. The majority (79.1%) took various drugs in parallel as assessed by toxicologic analysis. Despite a young age, the deceased had a high burden of comorbid conditions, especially cardiovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, and infections. Evaluation of the kidneys demonstrated a broad spectrum of pathologic alterations predominated by arteriosclerotic and ischemic damage, mild interstitial inflammation, calcification of renal parenchyma, and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, with hypertensive-ischemic nephropathy as the most common cause of nephropathy. Interstitial inflammation (OR, 16.59; 95% CI, 3.91-70.39) and renal calcification (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.03- 5.75) were associated with severe IVDU, whereas hypertensive and ischemic damage were associated with cocaine abuse (OR, 6.00; 95% CI, 1.27-28.44). Neither specific glomerular damage indicative for heroin and hepatitis C virus-related disease nor signs of analgesic nephropathy were found. White population, lack of a comparable control group, incomplete clinical data, and absence of routine immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Illicit drug abuse is associated with a broad but unspecific spectrum of pathologic alterations of the kidneys. Cocaine abuse has a deleterious role in this setting by promoting hypertensive and ischemic damage.},

The reason for this restricted use is largely unknown. However, among other reasons, it may be related to the difficulties in positioning an electrode in the epidural space. We studied the feasibility and efficacy of subcutaneous implantation of an entire system.   Seven male patients, mean age 67 ± 3.6 years, received complete subcutaneously implanted electrical nerve stimulation (SENS) systems, with one or more leads fixed in parallel with the sternum, covering the angina area. At baseline and 2 months follow-up patients performed exercise and quality of life tests (Seattle Angina Questionnaire and diaries number angina attacks and glyceryl trinitrate use).   All patients showed clinical relevant improvement (baseline vs. follow-up), in exercise (63%) and quality of life (Seattle Angina Questionnaire 59%). The number of angina attacks dropped 82% and the number of glyceryl trinitrate use decreased by 90%. No major adverse events were observed.   This small feasibility study demonstrates SENS to be an effective and safe method to treat patients suffering from refractory angina. Furthermore, SENS is less invasive and appears to have less lead migrations compared with SCS.},

We sought the perspectives of 15 Head Start parents equally representing Black, Latino(a), and White parents, 17 teachers, and 11 healthcare providers to discover facilitators and barriers to adherence with professional recommendations. We found that silos in professional communications, parent distrust, knowledge deficits, and stigma were barriers to obtaining developmental recommendations. Participants also identified missed opportunities to facilitate interagency coordination, parental advocacy of a child's developmental needs, and professional alliances to take collaborative actions for early identification and treatment. Furthermore, a subculture of poverty adversely influenced adherence to developmental recommendations, and ethno-racial biases affected Black and Latino(a) families' follow-through. Our findings highlight how the lack of coordination between sectors resulted in the dismissal of parental concerns or denial of services by 1 system or the other, thus, at the very least reducing the child's chances for earlier intervention and treatment. We also identified potential benefits to children when the barriers of poverty and ethnoracial bias are addressed by professionals with coordinated actions, and new systems are developed for sharing developmental screening results and partnering to coordinate care across the preschool and primary healthcare settings.},

Potassium and sodium shifts were derived from balance measurements in a preclinical study of livers that underwent DHOPE (n = 6) or SCS alone (n = 9), followed by ex situ normothermic reperfusion. Similar measurements were performed in a clinical study of DHOPE-preserved livers (n = 10) and control livers that were transplanted after SCS only (n = 9).

Since attentional biases in those with elevated anxiety remain understudied using more naturalistic stimuli, such as dynamic social videos, the purpose of this explorative study was to use novel dynamic stimuli and modern eye-tracking equipment to further investigate negative attentional biases in anxious emerging, female adults. Non-clinical participants (N = 62; mean age = 20.44 years; biologically female) completed validated questionnaires regarding their anxiety symptoms and completed a free-viewing task by watching 30-s video clips while having their eye movements tracked. The video clips were shown in side-by-side pairs (i.e., positive-neutral, negative-neutral, and positive-negative) on a split screen without audio. Overall, participants fixated more quickly on emotional videos (i.e., positive and negative) over neutral ones, with more anxious participants orienting their gaze faster to the videos, regardless of content. Moreover, individuals with greater self-reported anxiety spent more time gazing at negative videos in negative-neutral pairings, highlighting that emerging female adults with increased anxiety symptoms may show a negative attention bias when viewing social interactions. Importantly, by incorporating novel, dynamic stimuli, we expand upon prior research on attentional biases, with the potential to adapt this approach for novel interventions that may ultimately help those suffering from anxiety.},

VPS4A accumulates at the cytoplasmic viral assembly complex (cVAC) of cells infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the site where nascent virus particles obtain their membrane envelope. Here we show that VPS4A is recruited to the cVAC via interaction with pUL71. Sequence analysis, deep-learning structure prediction, molecular dynamics and mutagenic analysis identify a short peptide motif in the C-terminal region of pUL71 that is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with VPS4A. This motif is predicted to bind the same groove of the N-terminal VPS4A Microtubule-Interacting and Trafficking (MIT) domain as the Type 2 MIT-Interacting Motif (MIM2) of cellular ESCRT-III components, and this viral MIM2-like motif (vMIM2) is conserved across β-herpesvirus pUL71 homologues. However, recruitment of VPS4A by pUL71 is dispensable for HCMV morphogenesis or replication and the function of the conserved vMIM2 during infection remains enigmatic. VPS4-recruitment via a vMIM2 represents a previously unknown mechanism of molecular mimicry in viruses, extending previous observations that herpesviruses encode proteins with structural and functional homology to cellular ESCRT-III components.},

The symposium focused on the current knowledge of these autoantibodies' role in various diseases, such as cardiovascular, renal, infectious (COVID-19), and autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus). Beyond their association with disease phenotypes, intense research related to the mechanistic action of these autoantibodies on immune regulation and pathogenesis has been developed, underscoring the role of autoantibodies targeting GPCRs on disease outcomes and etiopathogenesis. The observation repeatedly highlighted that autoantibodies targeting GPCRs could also be present in healthy individuals, suggesting that anti-GPCR autoantibodies play a physiologic role in modeling the course of diseases. Since numerous therapies targeting GPCRs have been developed, including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies designed for treating cancer, infections, metabolic disorders, or inflammatory conditions, anti-GPCR autoantibodies themselves can serve as therapeutic targets to reduce patients' morbidity and mortality, representing a new area for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.},

PMPs inherit a myriad of proteins and small RNAs from the parental platelets, which in turn can be transferred to cancer cells following internalization. However, the exact effect this may have in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate whether PMPs could transfer their contents to the THP-1 cell line and if this could change the biological behavior of the recipient cells. Using acridine orange stained PMPs, we demonstrated that PMPs were internalized by THP-1 cells, which resulted in increased levels of miR-125a, miR-125b, and miR-199. In addition, co-incubation with PMPs protected THP-1 and primary AML cells against daunorubicin-induced cell death. We also showed that PMPs impaired cell growth, partially inhibited cell cycle progression, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and induced differentiation toward macrophages in THP-1 cells. Our results suggest that this altering of cell phenotype, in combination with decrease in cell activity may offer resistance to daunorubicin-induced apoptosis, as serum starvation also yielded a lower frequency of dead and apoptotic cells when treated with daunorubicin.},

In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) this can induce chemoresistance, partially through a decrease in cell activity. Here we investigated if the internalization of PMPs protected the monocytic AML cell line, THP-1, from apoptosis by decreasing the initial cellular damage inflicted by treatment with daunorubicin, or via direct modulation of the apoptotic response. We examined whether PMPs could protect against apoptosis after treatment with a selection of inducers, primarily associated with either the intrinsic or the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and protection was restricted to the agents targeting intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, levels of daunorubicin-induced DNA damage, assessed by measuring gH2AX, were reduced in both 2N and 4N cells after PMP co-incubation. Measuring different BCL2-family proteins before and after treatment with daunorubicin revealed that PMPs downregulated the pro-apoptotic PUMA protein. Thus, our findings indicated that PMPs may protect AML cells against apoptosis by reducing DNA damage both dependent and independent of cell cycle phase, and via direct modulation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway by downregulating PUMA. These findings further support the clinical relevance of platelets and PMPs in AML.},

This clinical review paper will focus on some of the more commonly used irrigation solutions; povidone-iodine (PI), chlorhexidine (CHG), acetic acid (AA), hydrogen peroxide (HP), antibiotic irrigations, taurolidine, and polyhexanide-betaine (PB). Significant research has been performed on the prevention of PJI, including use of intraoperative joint irrigation solutions. Several solutions have been theorized to aid in infection prevention, but no evidence-based practice guidelines in this area of orthopaedics have been established. There is a paucity of prospective randomized control trials to compare the efficacy of these joint irrigation solutions. The authors present a review regarding seven major categories of commonly used intraoperative joint irrigation solutions. The current literature fails to demonstrate a clear consensus for a preferred solution and concentration for povidone-iodine, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, antibiotic irrigations, taurolidine, and polyhexanide-betaine. Prospective, randomized control trials directly comparing these different irrigation solutions are needed.},

A novel P450 cDNA was identified in a chicory root EST library. Co-expression of the enzyme with a valencene synthase in yeast, led to formation of trans-nootkatol, cis-nootkatol and (+)-nootkatone. The novel enzyme was also found to catalyse a three step conversion of germacrene A to germacra-1(10),4,11(13)-trien-12-oic acid, indicating its involvement in chicory sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis. Likewise, amorpha-4,11-diene was converted to artemisinic acid. Surprisingly, the chicory P450 has a different regio-specificity on (+)-valencene compared to germacrene A and amorpha-4,11-diene.},

Plant-based production systems for terpenoids critically depend on the availability of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Currently, these systems show insufficient yields, due to the competition for FPP of newly introduced pathways with endogenous ones. In this study, for the first time an RNAi strategy aiming at silencing of endogenous pathways for increased (+)-valencene production was employed. Firstly, a transient production system for (+)-valencene in Nicotiana benthamiana was set up using agroinfiltration. Secondly, silencing of the endogenous 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS) and squalene synthase (SQS) that compete for the FPP pool was deployed. This resulted in a N. benthamiana plant that produces (+)-valencene as a prevalent volatile with a 2.8-fold increased yield. Finally, the size of the FPP pool was increased by overexpression of enzymes that are rate-limiting in FPP biosynthesis. Combined with silencing of EAS and SQS, no further increase of (+)-valencene production was observed, but emission of farnesol. Formation of farnesol, which is a breakdown product of FPP, indicates that overproducing sesquiterpenes is no longer limited by FPP availability in the cytosol. This study shows that metabolic engineering of plants can effectively be used for increased production of desired products in plants.},

Besides, inulin chicory taproots also accumulate sesquiterpene lactones (STLs). These are bitter tasting compounds, which need to be removed during inulin extraction, resulting in additional costs. In this work, we describe chicory lines where STL accumulation is almost completely eliminated. Genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to inactivate four genes that encode the enzyme that performs the first dedicated step in STL synthesis, germacrene A synthase (CiGAS). Chicory lines were obtained that carried null mutations in all four CiGAS genes. Lines lacking functional CiGAS alleles showed a normal phenotype upon greenhouse cultivation and show nearly complete elimination of the STL synthesis in the roots. It was shown that the reduction in STLs could be attributed to mutations in genetically linked copies of the CiGAS-short gene and not the CiGAS-long gene, which is relevant for breeding the trait into other cultivars. The inactivation of the STL biosynthesis pathway led to increase in phenolic compounds as well as accumulation of squalene in the chicory taproot, presumably due to increased availability of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FFP). These results demonstrate that STLs are not essential for chicory growth and that the inhibition of the STL biosynthesis pathway reduced the STL levels chicory which will facilitate inulin extraction.},

The current study examined the relationship between parental mental health, perceived social support, and child mental health (internalizing/externalizing symptoms) in children with 22q11DS. Ninety caregivers of children with 22q11DS completed an online survey measuring parental depressive symptoms, perceived social support, and child mental health problems (internalizing and externalizing symptoms). Structural equation models were run to examine the postulated relationships between variables. The caregiver's depressive symptoms were associated with higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms in their children with 22q11DS (mean age 11.8, SD 7.6 years). Caregivers experiencing symptoms of depression were less likely to report strong social support, and lower perceived social support was associated with greater child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The relationship between caregiver's depressive symptoms and internalizing symptoms in their children was mediated by perceived social support, but no such mediating effects were observed for externalizing symptoms. These findings provide valuable insights into the mental health burdens facing families living with 22q11DS. Interventions focusing on 22q11DS should integrate techniques to foster social and other supports to improve the mental health of caregivers and children.},

However, like many regions where marine mega-fauna gather, these waters are also the focus of a flourishing local eco-tourism and whale watching industry. Our aim was to establish current trends in habitat preference in female-calf humpback whale pairs within this region, focusing specifically on the busy, eastern portions of the channel. We used an equally-spaced zigzag transect survey design, compiled our results in a GIS model to identify spatial trends and calculated Neu's Indices to quantify levels of habitat use. Our study revealed that while mysticete female-calf pairs on breeding grounds typically favor shallow, inshore waters, female-calf pairs in the Au'au Channel avoided shallow waters (<20 m) and regions within 2 km of the shoreline. Preferred regions for female-calf pairs comprised water depths between 40-60 m, regions of rugged bottom topography and regions that lay between 4 and 6 km from a small boat harbor (Lahaina Harbor) that fell within the study area. In contrast to other humpback whale breeding grounds, there was only minimal evidence of typical patterns of stratification or segregation according to group composition. A review of habitat use by maternal females across Hawaiian waters indicates that maternal habitat choice varies between localities within the Hawaiian Islands, suggesting that maternal females alter their use of habitat according to locally varying pressures. This ability to respond to varying environments may be the key that allows wildlife species to persist in regions where human activity and critical habitat overlap.},

While changes in climate will likely lead to the greatest impacts at the system-level, for marine megafauna, entanglement in marine debris also constitutes a pernicious threat. For baleen whales, in regions where high productivity and prolific fisheries overlap, entanglement is emerging as a component of their life history: In some of these regions, entanglement comprises the leading cause of serious injury and mortality. Additionally, up to 80% of whales carry scars indicative of entanglement, and associated declines in long-term health are reducing fecundity. Here, we describe behavioral traits seen in humpback whales during entanglement incidents. Specifically, we focus on reports of humpback whales that have remained in association with entangled whales during these incidents and apply the term "companion whales" in reference to these whales. Reports reviewed include a detailed account of a recent incident observed in Hawaiian waters, a compilation of 62 accounts of similar behavior extracted from 414 reports of entanglement events provided by regional entanglement response networks, and a series of six reports associated with whaling activities. The similarities between the current behavior of companion whales and behaviors observed during whaling activities suggest that this may be an example of behavioral plasticity, underscoring the expanding behavioral repertoire exhibited by baleen whales, and highlighting their potential resilience as they respond to the changing marine environment.},

As a first step a diagnostic, temporary celiac plexus block with local anesthetics was performed. If substantial pain relief was obtained, the assumption was that pain was relayed via the celiac plexus and major splanchnic nerves. When pain recurred, patients were then scheduled for a major splanchnic nerve block with radiofrequency ablation. In cases with no pain relief, it was assumed that pain was relayed via the aortico-renal plexus, and catheter-based renal denervation was performed. Sixty patients were referred, of which 44 were eligible. In 36 patients the diagnostic celiac plexus block resulted in substantial pain relief with a change in the median visual analogue scale (VAS) score pre-post intervention of 50/100. Of these patients, 23 received a major splanchnic nerve block because pain recurred, with a change in median VAS pre-post block of 53/100. In 8 patients without pain relief after the diagnostic block, renal denervation was performed in 5, with a borderline significant change in the median VAS pre-post intervention of 20/100.

Here, we generated isogenic TP53-knockout versions of the euploid AML cell line EEB to investigate the impact of TP53 on karyotype stability. We show that chromosome abnormalities spontaneously arise in TP53-deficient cells. Numerical aneuploidy could, to some extent, be propagated in a TP53-proficient setting, indicating that it does not necessarily trigger TP53 activation. In contrast, tolerance to structural chromosome aberrations was almost entirely restricted to TP53-knockout clones, all of which were able to continue proliferation in the presence of damaged DNA. Mechanistically, as a source of chromosome aberrations, limited numerical but not structural chromosomal instability was tolerated by TP53-wildtype cells. In contrast, structural instability was found only in TP53-knockout cells. Together, in myeloid cells TP53 loss allows for the development of complex karyotype aberrations and karyotype heterogeneity by perpetuation of chromosome segregation errors.},

Patient records and transfusion data, divided into 5-year intervals, were analyzed. The incidence of massive transfusion (>10 units of red blood cells [RBCs] in 24 h) was 27% and did not change over time, whereas the median (interquartile range) transfusion requirement in the whole cohort decreased from 8 (5-12) to 3 (0-10) RBCs (p < 0.001). In patients transplanted from the intensive care unit, the incidence of massive transfusion increased over time from 25% to 54% (p = 0.04) and median transfusion requirements from 4.5 (3-8.5) units to 14.5 (5-26) units of RBCs (p = 0.03). Multivariable analysis showed that circulatory support, pulmonary hypertension, re-transplantation, cystic fibrosis, Eisenmenger syndrome, bilateral transplantation, and low body mass index were associated with massive transfusion. Patients with massive transfusion had more primary graft dysfunction grade III at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours (p < 0.001), higher 30-day mortality (13% v 4%; p < 0.001), and lower 5-year survival (hazard ratio 3.67 [95% confidence interval 1.72-7.85]; p < 0.001). The incidence of massive transfusion did not change over time, whereas transfusion requirements in the whole cohort decreased. In patients transplanted from the intensive care unit, massive transfusion and transfusion requirements increased. Massive transfusion was associated with poor outcome.},

Control measurements were made in four animals in which the vascular clamp was not adjusted. Fetal PaO2 fell from 20.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 16.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg within 1 hour after application of the clamp and remained suppressed during 48 hours. There was a transient acidemia at 1 to 2 hours that had corrected by 8 hours. Fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone levels rose from 24 +/- 6 to 1320 +/- 205 pg/ml at 2 hours but decreased by 16 hours. Measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, more than 95% of immunoreactivity corresponded to adrenocorticotropic hormone1-39. Fetal cortisol levels rose by 6 hours and remained elevated through 48 hours. Maternal adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and progesterone levels were unchanged during the study period. We conclude that fetal hypoxemia-acidemia after restriction of uterine blood flow provokes fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone release, but the elevation in adrenocorticotropic hormone is not sustained. However, the level of fetal cortisol rises progressively, consistent with fetal adrenal activation.},

Forty participants with T1D for >1 year and an HbA1C level of ≥9.5% (80 mmol/mol) enrolled for a multidisciplinary intervention that included pediatric endocrinologists, pediatric psychologists, and a certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES). The CDCES-integrated medical management, while reinforcing physical, emotional, and behavioral health, connected with families to set and monitor goals and reviewed medication adjustments. The feasibility was assessed based on enrollment targets; acceptability based on retention rates; and preliminary efficacy based on changes in HbA1C levels, quality of life, diabetes-related strengths and resilience, hospital admissions, emergency room visits, and missed school days. Of 43 patients and families approached, 40 agreed to participate, 36 completed the 4-month intervention, and 31 completed full 8 months of follow-up data collection. The CDCES coach averaged 6.8 contacts per participant during the 8-month study period. The HbA1C level reduced significantly from baseline to 4 months (12.1% ± 1.6% to 11.0% ± 1.9%, P = .001) and was sustained at 8 months (10.7% ± 1.9%, P < .001). The participants reported significant increases in diabetes-specific quality of life (P < .05) and diabetes-related strength and resilience (P = .003). The missed school days reduced from 7.23 ± 7.5 days to 1.55 ± 1.9 days (P < .001), and the diabetes-related hospitalizations decreased from 0.4 ± 0.6 to 0.1 ± 0.3 (P = .009). Preliminary data suggest that a multidisciplinary intervention leveraging a team-based approach with a physician, psychologist, and CDCES can support improvements in glycemic control and psychosocial outcomes among youth with T1D with an HbA1C level above the target.},

This study aims to identify whether SES-affected treatment wait times for laryngeal therapies in this system.

Data retrieved through medical records; surgical and voice therapy wait times were normalized to each practitioner's average wait time for respective diagnostic categories. Income was used to assess SES and was derived from Statistics Canada census information based on patient postal codes. Data analysis identified 578 patients (59% male). Mean wait time to surgery for all conditions was 123.5 (95% confidence interval 113.1-133.9) days. Analysis of variance analysis found no difference in wait times between different SES groups ( SES did not affect treatment wait times for laryngeal therapies in a universal healthcare system. Wait times were shorter for oncologic and obstructive conditions compared with benign conditions, reflecting an ability to accommodate clinical needs without impacting care access at the detriment of different SES statuses. 4.},

Despite a hardware mishap that rendered the radar inoperable shortly after launch, the radiometer continues to operate nominally, returning more than two years of science data that have helped to improve existing hydrological applications and foster new ones. Beginning in late 2016 the SMAP project launched a suite of new data products with the objective of recovering some high-resolution observation capability loss resulting from the radar malfunction. Among these new data products are the SMAP Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product that was released in December 2016, followed by the SMAP/Sentinel-1 Active-Passive Soil Moisture Product in April 2017. This article covers the development and assessment of the SMAP Level 2 Enhanced Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P_E). The product distinguishes itself from the current SMAP Level 2 Passive Soil Moisture Product (L2_SM_P) in that the soil moisture retrieval is posted on a 9 km grid instead of a 36 km grid.

Cadaveric shoulders were studied with a 1.5-T MR imaging unit with the arm externally rotated. Fifteen milliliters of a gadolinium-containing contrast agent were injected into the glenohumeral joint. Twenty-four sets of images of cadaveric joints were evaluated independently by two observers. These sets consisted of MR arthrographic images obtained with traction (applied to the wrist using 1- to 3-kg weights) and without traction in five shoulders in which SLAP lesions had been excluded arthroscopically or by cadaveric sectioning; and MR arthrographic images obtained with and without traction in seven shoulders in which various types of SLAP lesions had been created arthroscopically and later confirmed by cadaveric sectioning. Analysis of the data indicated that MR arthrography in combination with arm traction and external rotation improved diagnostic accuracy with regard to identification and categorization of SLAP lesions when compared with studies made without traction. The combination of MR arthrography and arm traction with the shoulder in external rotation provides a more effective approach for detection of SLAP lesions than does similar MR arthrography performed without arm traction.},

  abstract = {The term lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompasses a range of urinary symptoms, including storage symptoms (e.g. overactive bladder [OAB]) as well as voiding and post-micturition symptoms. Although treatment of male LUTS tends to focus on voiding symptoms, patients typically find storage symptoms the most bothersome. The core storage symptom is urgency, which drives the other main storage symptoms of increased daytime frequency, nocturia and incontinence. Although several validated questionnaires have been widely used to study urgency, few measure the two important storage parameters, urgency and frequency, in a single assessment. The total urgency and frequency score (TUFS) is a new validated tool that captures both variables and is derived from the Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale, which has been validated in patients with OAB and LUTS. The TUFS was first validated in OAB in the phase IIa BLOSSOM study, which was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of mirabegron, a β3 -adrenoceptor agonist, in 260 patients. The responsiveness of the TUFS to treatment has been confirmed in a further three large-scale randomized controlled trials of solifenacin in patients with OAB or LUTS. Changes in TUFS from baseline to end of treatment were consistent with changes in micturition diary variables in all four studies. Furthermore, the TUFS was significantly correlated with several health-related quality-of-life variables in the phase III NEPTUNE study. Thus, the TUFS appears to be useful for assessing improvements in major storage symptoms (urgency and frequency) in clinical trials.},

For negatively charged capillary, energy conversion performance degrades significantly with the increase of counter-ion valence. For both positively and negatively charged capillaries, higher maximum efficiency can be resulted in low bulk concentration and surface charge density regimes. However, high maximum pressure rise generation for the pumping is found in the low bulk concentration and high surface charge density regimes. For the electric power generation, higher maximum streaming potential is found when both bulk concentration and surface charge density are low.},

Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to analyze the concept of child abuse based on literature published between 1960 and 2008 (n = 32) using Walker and Avant's concept analysis model in which child abuse is determined along two dimensions. These dimensions include the objective physical dimension, which addresses children younger than 20 years of age who experience repeated injuries or whose history of injury is incompatible with the findings of physical examinations, and the subjective psychological dimension, which addresses children who were treated unfairly or malevolently and their subsequent subjective feelings. Antecedents consist of abuser, victim, and environmental characteristics. Consequences include both physical and psychological aspects.

Previous studies show that students who struggle with the identification and segmentation of speech sounds are more likely to encounter difficulties with clinical phonetic transcription. To clarify the connection between phonemic awareness and phonetic transcription in Mandarin-speaking undergraduate students, as well as the improvement of these skills after phonetic transcription training. A pretest-post-test design was adopted for this study. The experimental group (n = 38) consisted of students majoring in audiology and speech-language pathology who were given 12 weeks of transcription training. The control group (n = 33) consisted of audiology and speech-language pathology majors who completed the same module a year earlier without undergoing the transcription training. Two instruments were used to assess their skills: (1) the Phonemic Awareness Skill Test (PA test) and (2) the Phonetic Transcription Skill Test (PT test) designed for the purposes of the present study. Performance on most subtests of the PT and PA tests improved significantly at post-test for the experiment group, although only PT training was provided. After phonetic transcription training, the relationship between phonemic addition abilities and phonetic transcription strengthened. Phonemic identification was found to be a predictor of undergraduate students' PT skills of disordered speech samples. Results from this study provide insights into the role of phonetic transcription training in improving phonemic awareness and phonetic transcription skills. What is already known on the subject Phonetic transcription of disordered speech samples is especially crucial for the assessment and treatment of functional or organic speech-sound disorders. Phonemic awareness is not only an essential ability for reading alphabetic language but also associated with acquiring phonetic transcription skills. What this paper adds to existing knowledge A dynamically changing association between phonemic transcription and phonetic transcription during transcription training was reported. Phonetic transcription training of disordered speech samples acted as a driving force for deeper relationships between the two skills. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Training phonetic recognition and transcription equips future and practising speech-language pathologists with better skills in managing speech-sound disorders. Implications for phonemic awareness training also have the potential to extend to the literacy skills of alphabetic language speakers.},

  abstract = {The cascade of events leading to compromised mitochondrial integrity in response to stress is mediated by various combinatorial interactions of pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules. Nur77, an immediate early gene that encodes a nuclear orphan receptor, translocates from the nucleus to mitochondria to induce cytochrome c release and apoptosis in cancer cells in response to various pro-apoptotic treatments. However, the role of Nur77 in the cardiac setting is still unclear. The objective of this study is to determine the physiological relevance and pathophysiological importance of Nur77 in cardiomyocytes. Myocardial Nur77 is upregulated following cardiomyopathic injury and, while expressed in the postnatal myocardium, declines in level within weeks after birth. Nur77 is localized predominantly in cardiomyocyte nuclei under normal conditions where it is not apoptotic, but translocates to mitochondria in response to oxidative stress both in vitro and in vivo. Mitochondrial localization of Nur77 induces cytochrome c release and typical morphological features of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. Knockdown of Nur77 rescued hydrogen peroxide-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Translocation of Nur77 from the nucleus to the mitochondria in cardiomyocytes results in the loss of mitochondrial integrity and subsequent apoptosis in response to ischaemia/reperfusion injury. Our findings identify Nur77 as a novel mediator of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and warrants further investigation of mitochondrial Nur77 translocation as a mechanism to control cell death in the treatment of ischaemic heart diseases.},

In order to improve PAC nursing education and quality of care, the present study applies a modified Delphi method to identify the core competences of nurses who provide PAC services to acute stroke patients. We surveyed 18 experts in post-acute care and long-term care anonymously using a 29-question questionnaire in order to identify the essential professional skills that are required to perform PAC effectively. The results of this survey indicate that the core competences of PAC may be divided into two categories: Case Management and Care Management. Case Management includes Direct Care, Communication, Health Care Education, Nursing Consulting, and Family Assessment & Health Care. Care Management includes Interdisciplinary Teamwork, Patient Care Management, and Resource Integration. The importance and practicality of each item was evaluated using a 7-point Likert scale. The experts required 2 rounds to reach a consensus about the importance and 3 rounds to determine the practicality of PAC core competences. This process highlighted the differing points of view that are held by professionals in the realms of nursing, medicine, and national health policy. The PAC in-job training program in its current form inadequately cul-tivates core competence in Care Management. The results of the present study may be used to inform the development of PAC nurse orientation training programs and continuing education courses.},

We performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify loci associated with serum C-reactive protein (marker of inflammation) among Ghanaians and further assessed whether differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were linked to CVD in previous reports, or to estimated CVD risk in the same population. We used the Illumina Infinium® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to obtain DNAm profiles of blood samples in 589 Ghanaians from the RODAM study (without acute infections, not taking anti-inflammatory medications, CRP levels < 40 mg/L). We then used linear models to identify DMPs associated with CRP concentrations. Post-hoc, we evaluated associations of identified DMPs with elevated CVD risk estimated via ASCVD risk score. We also performed subset analyses at CRP levels ≤10 mg/L and replication analyses on candidate probes. Finally, we assessed for biological relevance of our findings in public databases. We subsequently identified 14 novel DMPs associated with CRP. In post-hoc evaluations, we found that DMPs in PC, BTG4 and PADI1 showed trends of associations with estimated CVD risk, we identified a separate DMP in MORC2 that was associated with CRP levels ≤10 mg/L, and we successfully replicated 65 (24%) of previously reported DMPs. All DMPs with gene annotations (13) were biologically linked to inflammation or CVD traits. We have identified epigenetic loci that may play a role in the intersection between inflammation and CVD among Ghanaians. Further studies among other Africans are needed to confirm our findings.},

However, the role of biological aging in this emerging burden of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) among migrant and non-migrant Africans is unknown. We aimed to examine differences in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) as measured by four clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge and GrimAge) and their associations with cardiometabolic factors among migrant Ghanaians in Europe and non-migrant Ghanaians. Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data of 712 Ghanaians from cross-sectional RODAM study were used to quantify EAA. We assessed correlation of DNAmAge measures with chronological age, and then performed linear regressions to determine associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood pressure, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and one-carbon metabolism nutrients with EAA among migrant and non-migrants. We replicated our findings among 172 rural-urban sibling pairs from India migration study and among 120 native South Africans from PURE-SA-NW study. We found that Ghanaian migrants have lower EAA than non-migrants. Within migrants, higher FBG was positively associated with EAA measures. Within non-migrants, higher BMI, and Vitamin B9 (folate) intake were negatively associated with EAA measures. Our findings on FBG, BMI and folate were replicated in the independent cohorts. Our study shows that migration is negatively associated with EAA among Ghanaians. Moreover, cardiometabolic factors are differentially associated with EAA within migrant and non-migrant subgroups. Our results call for context-based interventions for CMD among transitioning populations that account for effects of biological aging. European Commission.},

In that study, the prostate volume is estimated by transabdominal ultrasonography. The accuracy of those measurements was verified by comparison of transabdominal to transrectal stepwise planimetric ultrasonography as the gold standard. Also, two different transabdominal devices used were compared, and the influence of different operators was studied. Two series of measurements in 100 patients each were done. In the first series, transabdominal and transrectal sonography were pairwise compared in each patient. In the second series, transabdominal measurements were done with two devices (a hospital Aloka SSD-1700 and a portable Aloka SSD-900). Transrectal scannings were done by three investigators whilst all transabdominal scannings were done by one. Regression graphs, ratio plots and statistical analyses of the data quantified the reproducibility of different methods, observers and device types. In the transrectal-transabdominal series of prostate volume measurements (in cm3), the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.84 (p < 0.001), the mean of the means was 51.8 +/- 23.0 (mean +/- S.D.), and the mean of the differences was 1.0 +/- 1.4. In the series with two devices, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.73 (p < 0.001), the mean of the means was 31.0 +/- 10.9, and the mean of the differences was 1.0 +/- 1.3. No statistically significant differences were found between the transabdominal- transrectal ultrasonography, two different transabdominal devices nor between different observers. However, for those using these measurements in everyday clinical practice, it is worth to point out that in our data a transabdominal scan and a transrectal scan in the same patient, on the same day, differed more than 30% in one fourth of the patients and that two transabdominal scans in the same patient (with two different devices, on two different days) differed more than 30% in every fifth patient.},

The interest in using minimally invasive cardiac output monitors is growing. The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available devices to provide an overview of their validation studies in order to answer the question whether these devices are ready for implementation in clinical practice. Current evidence shows that minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring devices are not yet interchangeable with (trans)pulmonary thermodilution in measuring cardiac output. However, validation studies are generally single centre, are based on small sample sizes in heterogeneous groups, and differ in the statistical methods used. Minimally and noninvasive monitoring devices may not be sufficiently accurate to replace (trans)pulmonary thermodilution in estimating cardiac output. The current paradigm shift to explore trending ability rather than investigating agreement of absolute values alone is to be applauded. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of these devices in the context of (functional) haemodynamic monitoring before adoption into clinical practice can be recommended.},

To investigate the effect of age at injury on mortality and overall disability 7 to 8 years post-severe TBI across diverse age groups. Two prospective longitudinal cohorts assessed overall functional outcomes in 39 children/adolescents [Traumatisme Grave de l'Enfant (TGE) cohort, mean age at injury M(SD) = 7.5 years (4.6), range 0.3 to 14.7] and 86 adults [PariS-TBI cohort, M(SD) = 34.1 years (13.7), range 15.4 to 74.8], who sustained severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤8]. Both studies collected data on baseline demographics (age, gender, education level), initial injury severity (GCS, Injury Severity Score [ISS], length of coma), and mortality rates. Follow-up assessments included clinician-rated overall disability [Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E)], clinical/neurological recovery, and self-/proxy-reported questionnaires assessing school/work situation, anxiety/depression, and caregivers' perceived burden. Adults evidenced significantly higher mortality rates, longer lengths of coma, and more frequent persistent motor deficits than children/adolescents. Children/adolescents exhibited increased rates of good recovery (GOS-E) 7 to 8 years post-injury compared to adults (P = 0.03). In multivariate linear regression analyses, GOS-E was associated with GCS score and pre-injury education in the total sample and adults. In both age groups, overall post-injury disability was associated with the presence of school/work adaptations and motor deficits, increased anxiety/depression, and higher caregiver burden. These findings reveal distinct age-specific patterns of recovery and disability after severe TBI among children, adolescents, and adults, highlighting the need for tailored assessments and interventions for each group. Furthermore, they underline the necessity of prolonged follow-up in children and adolescents to evaluate their transition to independent living and professional integration. Future research should confirm these results and identify modifiable factors that promote recovery and minimize long-term disability.},

Pax-8 activity is regulated via a redox-based mechanism centered on the glutathionylation of specific cysteines in the N-terminal region (Cys45 and Cys57). These residues belong to a highly evolutionary conserved DNA binding site: the Paired Box (Prd) domain. Crystallographic protein-DNA complexes of the homologues Pax-6 and Pax-5 showed a bipartite Prd domain consisting of two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs separated by an extended linker region. Here, by means of nuclear magnetic resonance, we show for the first time that the HTH motifs are largely defined in the unbound Pax-8 Prd domain. Our findings contrast with previous induced fit models, in which Pax-8 is supposed to largely fold upon DNA binding. Importantly, our data provide the structural basis for the enhanced chemical reactivity of residues Cys45 and Cys57 and explain clinical missense mutations that are not obviously related to the DNA binding interface of the paired box domain. Finally, sequence conservation suggests that our findings could be a general feature of the Pax family transcription factors.},

In 2006, three lesions in the liver were detected and resected. The three lesions all showed activation of the β-catenin pathway and were histologically characterized by a highly differentiated steatotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with remnants of the underlying adenoma from which it arose, a hepatocellular adenoma with foci of well-differentiated HCC, and a cholestatic adenoma. Risk factors for the emergence of HCC included FA itself, the use of androgens for a period of 3 years preceding HSCT and toxicity of the conditioning regimen. Because of the danger of developing additional HCC, liver transplantation was proposed, taking into consideration that immunosuppression would increase the risk of other malignancies. By using part of the liver of the sister, who already acted as bone marrow donor 13 years earlier, immunosuppression could be avoided. Liver transplantation was performed in 2007 without complication. Five years after liver transplantation the patient is doing well. This case is twofold special being the first case reporting FA co-occurring with Marfan syndrome and being the first reported case of FA treated for HCC by liver transplantation from a HLA-identical sibling donor without the use of immunosuppression.},

To establish the relationship between three key aspects of human drug use in rats: the intermittent, binge nature of drug intake, the motivational conflict of drug seeking in the face of escalating negative costs, and the ability of different drug cues to interact to modulate relapse. Male and female rats were trained to self-administer cocaine on an intermittent access schedule, where brief drug-availability states were signaled by a shift in the ambient lighting of the environment, and cocaine infusions were signaled by a separate proximal discrete cue. Rats then went through a conflict procedure, where foot shock intensity associated with cocaine seeking was escalated until intake was suppressed. We then completed relapse tests where the drug-delivery cue was noncontingently presented alone, or in the context of dynamic drug-availability state transitions. Intermittent access spurred psychomotor sensitization and binge-like cocaine intake. The intensity of binge-like drug taking during training was predictive of later drug seeking despite escalating costs during conflict. In relapse tests, the ability of a proximal discrete drug cue to trigger relapse was gated by the presence of a global cue signaling drug-availability state transitions. Our results suggest that the pattern of drug intake plays a role in many features of addiction, including modifying an individual's willingness to endure high costs associated with drug seeking. Furthermore, our studies indicate that drug-related sensory information can be hierarchically organized to exert a dynamic modulating influence on drug-seeking motivation.},

Among these 105 patients, 24 (22%) received a dose less than 0.03 mg/kg (low dose) and 69 (65%) received a dose of at least 0.03 mg/kg (high dose). Seizure cessation rate was not different between the low- and high-dose groups (62.5% vs 76%; odds ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.19-1.44, p = 0.29). The administration of a second dose of CLZ was more frequent in the low- than the high-dose group (37.5% vs 16%; odds ratio 3.2, 95% CI 1.1-9.1, p = 0.04). Our study did not find any difference in seizure termination rate as a function of CLZ dose in children with CSE. However, a second CLZ dose was more frequently needed in the group receiving low (less than 0.03 mg/kg) CLZ.},

Outcomes were measured longitudinally to characterize how patients' voices and self-perceived voice handicaps changed after CTR. Retrospective case-series. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with refractory iSGS treated by CTR from 2006 to 2017. Voice Handicap Index (VHI), Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V), and acoustic analysis were prospectively collected preoperatively and postoperatively at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24-month intervals. A linear mixed model was used to evaluate temporal change. Thirty-three patients (97% female) were included. VHI scores increased significantly from baseline preoperative score (27.2 ± 22.7) to a mean value of 44.3 ± 25.6 (P < .001) 1-month postoperatively but decreased below preoperative scores after 2 years (18.8 ± 11.9, P = .795). Mean fundamental frequency (F0) values in speech decreased significantly from 192.0 ± 24.9 Hz preoperatively to 167.1 ± 19.8 Hz at a 2-year follow-up (P = .002), with a nadir value at 1-month postoperatively (148.4 ± 20.5, P < .001). CAPE-V scores increased significantly from preoperative to 1-month postoperative (3.0 ± 2.3 vs. 21.9 ± 17.3, P < .001) but returned toward baseline values at 24 months after CTR (6.9 ± 4.8, P = .027). CAPE-V measurements postoperatively were correlated with VHI and F0 (Pearson coefficient = 0.54 (VHI), -0.46 (F0), P < .001). Following CTR, mean F0 values were significantly and consistently lower but did increase over time, correlating with patients' improving VHI and CAPE-V scores. VHI values indicate that patient's perception of their voice is not significantly impacted in long term. These results provide a framework to counsel patients about long term voice expectations. 4 Laryngoscope, 132:1054-1060, 2022.},

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools may add to the armamentarium for physicians, decreasing the time to diagnosis and limiting the burden of dysphonia. Voice recordings of patients were collected from 2019 to 2021 using smartphones. The Saarbruecken dataset was included for comparison. Audio files were converted to mel-spectrograms using TensorFlow. Diagnostic categories were created to group pathology, including neurological and muscular disorders, inflammatory, mass lesions, and normal. The samples were further separated into sustained/a/and the rainbow passage. Two hundred three prospective samples and 1131 samples were used from the Saarbruecken database. The AI detected abnormal pathology with an F1-score of 98%. The artificial neural network (ANN) differentiated key pathologies, including unilateral paralysis, laryngitis, adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ADSD), mass lesions, and normal samples with 39%-87% F-1 scores. The Calgary database models had higher F-1 scores in a head-to-head comparison to the Saarbruecken and combined datasets (87% vs. 58% and 50%). The AI outperformed otolaryngologists using a standardized test set of recordings (83% compared to 55% ± 15%). An AI tool was created to differentiate pathology by individual or categorical diagnosis with high evaluation metrics. Prospective data should be collected in a controlled fashion to reduce intrinsic variability between recordings. Multi-center data collaborations are imperative to increase the prediction capability of AI tools for detecting vocal cord pathology. We provide proof-of-concept for an AI tool to assist primary care physicians in managing dysphonic patients. 3 Laryngoscope, 133:1952-1960, 2023.},

Histone chaperones are regulators of this process by preventing formation of non-nucleosomal histone-DNA complexes. Aprataxin and polynucleotide kinase like factor (APLF) is a non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair factor that possesses histone chaperone activity in its acidic domain (APLFAD). Here, we studied the molecular basis of this activity using biochemical and structural methods. We find that APLFAD is intrinsically disordered and binds histone complexes (H3-H4)2 and H2A-H2B specifically and with high affinity. APLFAD prevents unspecific complex formation between H2A-H2B and DNA in a chaperone assay, establishing for the first time its specific histone chaperone function for H2A-H2B. On the basis of a series of nuclear magnetic resonance studies, supported by mutational analysis, we show that the APLFAD histone binding domain uses two aromatic side chains to anchor to the α1-α2 patches on both H2A and H2B, thereby covering most of their DNA-interaction surface. An additional binding site on both APLFAD and H2A-H2B may be involved in the handoff between APLF and DNA or other chaperones. Together, our data support the view that APLF provides not only a scaffold but also generic histone chaperone activity for the NHEJ-complex.},

Neurofeedback (NF) seems a promising method to address the neural dysfunctions underlying those cognitive impairments. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a central hub for cognitive processing, is one of the brain regions known to be dysfunctional in schizophrenia. Here we conducted NF training based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with schizophrenia to enable them to control their ACC activity. Training was performed over 3 days in a group of 11 patients with schizophrenia and 11 healthy controls. Social feedback was provided in accordance with the evoked activity in the selected region of interest (ROI). Neural and cognitive strategies were examined off-line. Both groups learned to control the activity of their ACC but used different neural strategies: patients activated the dorsal and healthy controls the rostral subdivision. Patients mainly used imagination of music to elicit activity and the control group imagination of sports. In a stepwise regression analysis, the difference in neural control did not result from the differences in cognitive strategies but from diagnosis alone. Based on social reinforcers, patients with schizophrenia can learn to regulate localized brain activity. However, cognitive strategies and neural network location differ from healthy controls. These data emphasize that for therapeutic interventions in patients with schizophrenia compensatory strategies may emerge. Specific cognitive skills or specific dysfunctional networks should be addressed to train impaired skills. Social NF based on fMRI may be one method to accomplish precise learning targets.},

Tumor microenvironment represents a key component of the tumor ecosystem the complexity of which has to be accurately understood to define selective targeting opportunities, including immune-based therapies. We combined various approaches including single-cell transcriptomics to dissect the tumor microenvironment of both a transgenic mouse neuroblastoma model and a cohort of 10 biopsies from neuroblastoma patients, either at diagnosis or at relapse. Features of related cells were validated by multicolor flow cytometry and functional assays. We show that the immune microenvironment of MYCN-driven mouse neuroblastoma is characterized by a low content of T cells, several phenotypes of macrophages and a population of cells expressing signatures of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that are molecularly distinct from the various macrophage subsets. We document two cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) subsets, one of which corresponding to CAF-S1, known to have immunosuppressive functions. Our data unravel a complex content in myeloid cells in patient tumors and further document a striking correspondence of the microenvironment populations between both mouse and human tumors. We show that mouse intratumor T cells exhibit increased expression of inhibitory receptors at the protein level. Consistently, T cells from patients are characterized by features of exhaustion, expressing inhibitory receptors and showing low expression of effector cytokines. We further functionally demonstrate that MDSCs isolated from mouse neuroblastoma have immunosuppressive properties, impairing the proliferation of T lymphocytes. Our study demonstrates that neuroblastoma tumors have an immunocompromised microenvironment characterized by dysfunctional T cells and accumulation of immunosuppressive cells. Our work provides a new and precious data resource to better understand the neuroblastoma ecosystem and suggest novel therapeutic strategies, targeting both tumor cells and components of the microenvironment.},

To investigate the neurobehavioral effects of the Dtnbp1 mutation, we studied littermate sandy and wild-type controls on a C57BL/6J genetic background. The three animal groups were indistinguishable in their external physical characteristics, sensorimotor skills and indices of anxiety-like behaviors. In the open field, however, homozygous animals were hyperactive and appeared to show less habituation to the initially novel environment. In the Morris water maze, homozygous animals displayed clear deficits in spatial learning and memory with marginal deficits in visual association learning. Apart from the last mentioned deficits, these abnormalities are consistent with hippocampal dysfunction and in some cases with elevated dopaminergic transmission via D2 dopamine receptors. As similar deficits in spatial learning and memory have been found in schizophrenia, where decreased dysbindin-1 has been found in the hippocampus, the sandy mouse may also model certain aspects of cognition and behavior relevant to schizophrenia.},

This secondary analysis examines whether the interventions led to reduced loss of work productivity among younger BCSs and whether such reductions were mediated by reductions in depressive symptoms. The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment scale was used to measure work productivity loss at 4 assessment time points. Correlates of productivity loss at enrollment were examined using multivariable linear regression. Differences in change over time in productivity loss between each intervention group and control were assessed using linear mixed models. Reduced depressive symptoms were tested as a mediator of reduced productivity loss. Of 247 trial participants, 199 were employed and included in the analyses. At enrollment, higher productivity loss was associated with chemotherapy receipt (P = .003), younger age (P = .021), more severe cognitive problems (P = .002), higher musculoskeletal pain severity (P = .002), more depressive symptoms (P = .016), and higher fatigue severity (P = .033). The mindfulness intervention led to significantly less productivity loss compared with control at all 3 postintervention assessment points (all P < .05), with about 54% of the effect mediated by reduction in depressive symptoms. Survivorship education was not associated with reduced loss of productivity. These findings suggest that addressing depressive symptoms through behavioral interventions, such as mindfulness, may mitigate impacts on work productivity in younger BCSs.},

An obstructive ventilatory defect is a disproportionate reduction of maximal airflow from the lung in relation to the maximal volume that can be displaced from the lung. It implies airway narrowing and is defined by a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio below the 5th percentile of the predicted value (lower limit of normal, LLN). A restrictive disorder may be suspected when vital capacity (FVC) is reduced and FEV1/FVC is normal. It is definitely proven, however, only by a decrease in TLC below the 5th percentile of predicted value (LLN). The measurement of TLC by body plethysmography is necessary to confirm or exclude a restrictive defect or hyperinflation of the lung when FVC is below the LLN. 2012 a task force of the ERS published new reference values based on 74,187 records from healthy non-smoking males and females from 26 countries. The new reference equations for the 3-95 age range are now available that include appropriate age-dependent mean values and lower limits of normal (LLN).

It has been suggested, through computational models, that the presence and specific location of microcalcifications in the atherosclerotic cap can increase the risk of cap rupture. However, the experimental confirmation of this hypothesis is lacking. In this study, we investigated how the presence and location of microcalcifications, relative to the lumen, influence (local) mechanics and rupture behavior of atherosclerotic plaque caps. Using tissue-engineered fibrous cap analogs with hydroxyapatite (HA) clusters to mimic calcifications in human plaque caps, we replicated the microcalcification distribution observed in human carotid plaques, as identified by our histological analysis. The analogs were imaged using multiphoton microscopy with second-harmonic generation to assess local collagen fiber orientation and dispersion. Subsequently, they underwent uniaxial tensile testing to failure, during which local strain and failure characteristics were analyzed. Our results revealed that HA clusters, particularly those in the luminal region, contribute to increased local collagen fiber dispersion. Moreover, the presence of HA clusters reduced both failure tensile stress and strain in the TE cap analogs. Besides, the rupture location shifted toward the site of HA clusters. Additionally, rupture initiation was consistently found in high-strain regions, and in 86 % of the analogs, even at the highest strain location in the sample. Our findings suggest that microcalcification clusters in plaque caps may increase the cap rupture risk and relocate the rupture site. Moreover, local strain measurements can serve as an additional tool for plaque cap rupture risk assessment.},

We included 711 (of 814) children (response: 87%) aged 7-12 undergoing routine health assessments in nine PCH services across the Netherlands. Child health professionals interviewed and examined children and parents. Prior to the interview, parents completed the SDQ and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), which were not shown to the professionals. The CBCL and data about the child's current treatment status were used as criteria for the validity of the SDQ. We used four SDQ scoring approaches: an elevated SDQ Total Difficulties Score (TDS), parent-defined difficulties, an elevated score for emotional symptoms, conduct problems or hyperactivity in combination with a high impairment score, and a combined score: an elevated score for any of these three methods. The Cohen's Kappa ranged from 0.33 to 0.64 for the four scoring methods with the CBCL scores and treatment status, generally indicating a moderate to good agreement. All four methods added significantly to the identification of problems by the PCH. Classification based on the TDS yielded results similar to more complicated methods. The SDQ is a valid tool for the identification of psychosocial problems by PCH. As a first step, the use of a simple classification based on the SDQ TDS is recommended.},

  abstract = {Due to public health restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic required significant changes in the delivery of child and adolescent mental health services. The use of virtual care for balancing access with treatment needs requires a shared decision between clients, caregivers, and clinicians. One aspect for consideration is the length of treatment necessary to achieve desired outcomes and whether it differs by treatment modality. Insights gained from the comparison of treatment duration between modalities may improve our understanding of the effectiveness of virtual care and help to inform clinical decision-making and effective use of resources. We sought to improve our understanding of how treatment modality impacts treatment duration for children and adolescents accessing Community Mental Health and Addictions services at IWK Health following the rapid implementation of virtual care in March 2020. In this study, we aimed to compare the duration of treatment within episodes of care by treatment modality and determine whether client characteristics, system factors, or time period influenced any associations between treatment modality and treatment duration. Episodes of care were created using administrative data collected by the IWK Mental Health and Addictions program and used as the unit of analysis. A multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial model and time-to-event analysis were used to model the association between treatment modality and treatment duration, both in visits and days, adjusting for client and system characteristics. Virtual episodes of care had more visits than in-person episodes between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.38-1.83), and April 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022 (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.35), whereas between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023, virtual episodes of care were associated with fewer visits (IRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.91). Comparable results were seen for treatment duration in days (2020-2021: hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.76; 2021-2022: HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.90; and 2022-2023: HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97-1.25). These differences by time period relative to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and switch to virtual care were consistent after adjusting for client and system characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between virtual or in-person treatment modality and treatment duration. While initially longer than in-person episodes of care, both in numbers of visits and length in days, over time the average length of episodes conducted mainly virtually had attenuated. These findings may be due to growing comfort with the technology or client factors not adequately captured in administrative data. This information can be valuable to clinicians, clients, and their families regarding expected treatment timelines and aid in informing service planning.},

  abstract = {To investigate the prevalence, incidence rate (IR) and burden of health problems (injuries and illnesses) in Australian Olympic class and State Sailing Pathway Program (SSPP) athletes over 12-months of training and competition. Descriptive epidemiological study. Ninety-two Australian Sailing and SSPP athletes were prospectively followed during the 2019-2020 season. Medical attention injuries and illnesses were prospectively recorded, and further sub-categorised according to time loss. The IR and burden were calculated per 365 athlete-days, with differences in IR between sexes compared using negative binomial generated rate ratios. Three hundred and forty-nine injuries were reported in 53 athletes (57.6 %), with 14.3 % resulting in time loss. Injury IR was 3.71 (95%CI = 3.33-4.12) injuries per 365 athlete-days, with no difference observed between sex (IRR = 1.64; 95%CI = 0.81-3.34). Shoulder injuries were found to have the greatest burden. Fifty-four illnesses were reported in 27 athletes (29.3 %), with 39.0 % resulting in time loss. Respiratory infection (n = 22, 40.7 %) was the most common illness reported. Illness IR was 0.57 (95%CI = 0.43-0.75) illnesses per 365 athlete days, with females found to have a 3.6 fold increase in illness compared to males (IRR = 3.6; 95%CI = 2.0-6.7). The majority of health problems reported in sailing athletes did not result in time loss. There were no differences in the injury IR between sexes, however females had a 3.6-fold increase in reported illness. These results can inform future strategies to reduce key health problems in sailors. Future research investigating whether performance is impacted by the high rate of non-time loss health problems is warranted.},

Randomized pilot trial. Three academic and six teaching hospitals in the Netherlands. Couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility and an unfavorable prognosis for natural conception. One cycle of IVF-eSET or three cycles of IUI-COS. Ongoing pregnancy per couple. We randomly allocated 116 women to IVF-eSET (n = 58) or IUI-COH (n = 58). There were 14 ongoing pregnancies (24%) in the IVF-eSET group and 12 pregnancies (21%) in the IUI-COS group (relative ratio 1.17; 95% confidence interval 0.60-2.30). There were two twin pregnancies in the IVF-eSET group (14%) and two twin pregnancies and one triplet pregnancy in the IUI-COH group (25%). In patients with unexplained or mild male subfertility and a poor prognosis for natural conception, one cycle of IVF-eSET might be as effective as three cycles of IUI-COS as primary treatment. Elective single embryo transfer does not seem an effective strategy in preventing multiple pregnancies in this particular population. In the future a strict SET policy (i.e., compulsory SET) might be an option. Our trial provides evidence for the feasibility and highlights the importance of a large definitive trial to determine the effectiveness and side effects of both strategies.},

It uses both readily available and 3D-printed parts as well as a custom PCB and is easily serviceable. Moreover, it is fully customizable for various applications. Total cost is under €600. We equipped one channel with a custom Peltier-based temperature controller for precise heating or cooling and a mixer mechanism to prevent sedimentation of the cells within the syringe. Depending on the cells in the sample, heating and cooling can be useful to maintain a beneficial environment or to slow down cellular processes and cell death, respectively. Combined with microfluidics consumables and a microscope, the device is capable of integration into a high quality droplet-based single cell RNA sequencing workflow as shown here.

  abstract = {More than 13.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses were delivered between 2021 and 2023 through a mix of delivery platforms, with mass vaccination campaigns being the main approach. In 2022, with the continued circulation of SARS-CoV2 and the need for periodic boosters being most likely, countries were required to plan for more sustainable approaches to provide COVID-19 vaccinations. In this context of uncertainty, a global tool for integrating COVID-19 vaccines into immunization programs and as part of broader health systems was published jointly by the WHO and UNICEF to respond to country needs. This paper summarizes the approach to, and lessons learned during, the development of a global guidance document and describes some examples of its early use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The guidance leveraged existing health system frameworks, proposed four steps for planning and implementing the COVID-19 vaccination integration journey, and identified investment areas. The development process maximized robust global stakeholder and country engagement, and the timeframe was aligned with donor funding windows to support countries with the integration of COVID-19 vaccination. The rapid dissemination of the guidance document allowed countries to ascertain their readiness for integrating COVID-19 vaccination and inform the development of national plans and funding applications. While progress has been made in specific areas (e.g., optimizing cold chain and logistics leveraging COVID-19 vaccination), in the context of decreasing demand for COVID-19 vaccines, reaching adult COVID-19 vaccine high-priority-use groups and engaging and coordinating with other health programs (beyond immunization) remain challenges, particularly in LMICs. We share the learning that despite the uncertainties of a pandemic, guidance documents can be developed and used within a short timeframe. Working in partnership with stakeholders within and beyond immunization towards a common objective is powerful and can allow progress to be made in terms of integrating health services and better preparing for future pandemics.},

However, ICI can overstimulate the immune system, leading to a broad range of immunological side effects, known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Here, we report a case of optic neuropathy caused by pembrolizumab. A patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma received pembrolizumab every three weeks. Twelve days after the sixth cycle of pembrolizumab, the patient was admitted to the emergency department with blurred vision, visual field impairment and altered color perception affecting the right eye. The diagnosis of immune-related optic neuropathy was established. Pembrolizumab was stopped permanently and high-dose steroid treatment was immediately started. This emergency treatment led to a satisfactory binocular vision and an improvement of visual acuity testing results. After another 7 months, the left eye was affected with the same symptoms. At this time, only an extended immunosuppressive therapy consisting of high-dose steroid treatment, plasmapheresis, immunoglobulin treatment, retrobulbar injection of steroids and mycophenolate mofetil, successfully reduced the symptoms. This case highlights the need for prompt recognition and treatment of rare irAEs, such as optic neuropathy. Urgent treatment with initial high-dose steroid treatment is required to avoid persistent loss of visual acuity. Options for further treatment are mainly based on small case series and case reports. In our case, a retrobulbar injection of steroids in combination with mycophenolate mofetil showed significant success in treating steroid-refractory optic neuropathy.},

Exploratory studies evaluating the impact of COVID-19 infection on the plasma metabolome have been performed, often with small numbers of patients, and with or without relevant control data; however, determining the impact of biological and clinical variables remains critical to understanding potential markers of disease severity and progression. The present large study, including relevant controls, sought to understand independent and overlapping metabolic features of samples from acutely ill patients (n = 831), testing positive (n = 543) or negative (n = 288) for COVID-19. High-throughput metabolomics analyses were complemented with antigen and enzymatic activity assays on 831 plasma samples from acutely ill patients while in the emergency department, at admission, and during hospitalization. We then performed additional lipidomics analyses of the 60 subjects with the lowest and highest body mass index, either COVID-19 positive or negative. Omics data were correlated to detailed data on patient characteristics and clinical laboratory assays measuring coagulation, hematology and chemistry analytes. Significant changes in arginine/proline/citrulline, tryptophan/indole/kynurenine, fatty acid and acyl-carnitine metabolism emerged as highly relevant markers of disease severity, progression and prognosis as a function of biological and clinical variables in these patients. Further, machine learning models were trained by entering all metabolomics and clinical data from half of the COVID-19 patient cohort and then tested on the other half yielding ~ 78% prediction accuracy. Finally, the extensive amount of information accumulated in this large, prospective, observational study provides a foundation for follow-up mechanistic studies and data sharing opportunities, which will advance our understanding of the characteristics of the plasma metabolism in COVID-19 and other acute critical illnesses.},

FAI occurs when there is a conflict between the rim of the acetabulum and the femoral neck, usually due to irregularities of the proximal femur or acetabulum. Our aims were to compare the diagnostic efficacy of computed tomography arthrography (CTA) without traction, CTA with traction, and magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA) for the detection and grading of chondral and labral lesions in patients with a clinically positive impingement test and to determine the correlation between imaging findings and arthroscopic data in patients who had undergone surgery. This monocentric, observational, retrospective study was conducted on 95 consecutive patients referred to our imaging department with clinical symptoms suggestive of FAI between January 2012 and May 2023. A total of 21 patients underwent therapeutic arthroscopy after the failure of medical treatment. These patients underwent either CTA without traction, CTA with traction, or MRA. Chondral and labral lesions were assessed by two musculoskeletal radiologists who were unaware of the original arthroscopy findings and interpretations. The modified MAHORN (Multicenter Arthroscopy of the Hip Outcomes Research Network) classification was used for grading during imaging and surgery. There was no significant difference between the examination techniques for the diagnosis of labral lesions (p=0.1737). Cartilage lesions preferentially affected the acetabular side compared to the femoral side, with no significant difference between the examination techniques for the diagnosis of chondral lesions (p=0.1429 for femoral cartilage, p=0.0944 for acetabular cartilage). No significant difference was found between the imaging and surgical data for the diagnosis of labral and cartilage lesions, even when the three imaging techniques were combined (labrum, p=0.1797; acetabular cartilage, p=0.0588; femoral cartilage, p=0.6547). No significant difference was found between CTA without traction, CTA with traction, and MRA procedures for the detection and grading of chondral and labral lesions.

Tear fluid was taken from 12 healthy volunteers at different time points using specially designed Schirmer strips. Following the liquid extraction of metabolites from standardized punches, the remaining material was processed for bottom-up proteomics. Targeted metabolite profiling was performed adapting a metabolomics kit, which targets 188 metabolites from four different analyte classes. Proteomics was performed of the identical samples targeting 15 tear proteins relevant to ocular health. Sixty metabolites could be consistently determined in all tear samples (98 metabolites were detectable in average) covering acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, and glycerophospholipids. Following normalization, the majority of metabolites exhibited intraindividual variances of less than 20%, both regarding different times of sampling, and the individual eye. The targeted analysis of tear proteins revealed a mean intraindividual variation of 23% for the three most abundant proteins. Even extreme differences in tear secretion rates resulted in interindividual variability below 30% for 65 metabolites and two proteins. The newly established workflow can be used for combined targeted detection of metabolites and proteins in one punch of a Schirmer strip in a clinical setting. Our data about intra- and interindividual as well as intereye variation provide a valuable basis for the design of clinical studies, and for the applicability of multiplexed "omics" to well accessible tear fluid with regard to future routine use.},

We aimed to analyze whether markers of systemic inflammation can predict response to antibiotics in AECOPD. We used data from 243 exacerbations out of 205 patients from a placebo-controlled trial on doxycycline in addition to systemic corticosteroids for AECOPD. Clinical and microbiologic response, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level (cutoffs 5 and 50 mg/L), and serum procalcitonin level (PCT) (cutoffs 0.1 and 0.25 μg) were assessed. Potential bacterial pathogens were identified in the majority of exacerbations (58%). We found a modest positive correlation between PCT and CRP (r = 0.46, P < .001). The majority of patients (75%) had low PCT levels, with mostly elevated CRP levels. Although CRP levels were higher in the presence of bacteria (median, 33.0 mg/L [interquartile range, 9.75-88.25] vs 17 mg/L [interquartile range, 5.0-61.0] [P = .004]), PCT levels were similar. PCT and CRP performed similarly as markers of clinical success, and we found a clinical success rate of 90% in patients with CRP ≤ 5 mg/L. A significant effect of doxycycline was observed in patients with a PCT level < .1 μg/L (treatment effect, 18.4%; P = .003). A gradually increasing treatment effect of antibiotics (6%, 10%, and 18%), although not significant, was found for patients with CRP values of ≤ 5, 6-50, and > 50 mg/L, respectively. Contrary to the current literature, this study suggests that patients with low PCT values do benefit from antibiotics. CRP might be a more valuable marker in these patients.},

We have recently solved the structure of the heterodimeric complex of the C-terminal domains of XPF and ERCC1 (Tripsianes et al., Structure 2005;13:1849-1858). We found that this complex comprises a pseudo twofold symmetry axis and that the helix-hairpin-helix motif of ERCC1 is required for DNA binding, whereas the corresponding domain of XPF is functioning as a scaffold for complex formation with ERCC1. Despite the functional importance of heterodimerization, the C-terminal domain of XPF can also form homodimers in vitro. We here compare the stabilities of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes of the C-terminal domains of XPF and ERCC1. The higher stability of the XPF HhH complexes under various experimental conditions, determined using CD and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, is well explained by the structural differences that exist between the HhH domains of the two complexes. The XPF HhH homodimer has a larger interaction interface, aromatic stacking interactions, and additional hydrogen bond contacts as compared to the XPF/ERCC1 HhH complex, which accounts for its higher stability.},

  abstract = {Human XPF/ERCC1 is a structure-specific DNA endonuclease that nicks the damaged DNA strand at the 5' end during nucleotide excision repair. We determined the structure of the complex of the C-terminal domain of XPF with 10 nt ssDNA. A positively charged region within the second helix of the first HhH motif contacts the ssDNA phosphate backbone. One guanine base is flipped out of register and positioned in a pocket contacting residues from both HhH motifs of XPF. Comparison to other HhH-containing proteins indicates a one-residue deletion in the second HhH motif of XPF that has altered the hairpin conformation, thereby permitting ssDNA interactions. Previous nuclear magnetic resonance studies showed that ERCC1 in the XPF-ERCC1 heterodimer can bind dsDNA. Combining the two observations gives a model that underscores the asymmetry of the human XPF/ERCC1 heterodimer in binding at an ss/ds DNA junction.},

Here we biochemically characterize the substrate preferences of the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) domains of XPF and ERCC-XPF and show that the binding to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)/dsDNA junctions is dependent on joint binding to the DNA binding domain of ERCC1 and XPF. We reveal that the homodimeric XPF is able to bind various ssDNA sequences but with a clear preference for guanine-containing substrates. NMR titration experiments and },

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of a NINJ1 oligomer segmented from NINJ1 rings. Each NINJ1 subunit comprises amphipathic (⍺1, ⍺2) and transmembrane (TM) helices (⍺3, ⍺4) and forms a chain of subunits, mainly by the TM helices and ⍺1. ⍺3 and ⍺4 are kinked, and the Gly residues are important for function. The NINJ1 oligomer possesses a concave hydrophobic side that should face the membrane and a convex hydrophilic side formed by ⍺1 and ⍺2, presumably upon activation. This structural observation suggests that NINJ1 can form membrane disks, consistent with membrane fragmentation by recombinant NINJ1. Live-cell and super-resolution imaging uncover ring-like structures on the plasma membrane that are released into the culture supernatant. Released NINJ1 encircles a membrane inside, as shown by lipid staining. Therefore, NINJ1-mediated membrane disk formation is different from gasdermin-mediated pore formation, resulting in membrane loss and plasma membrane rupture.},

Researchers have listed the advantages of LDPs, but knowledge of how and why organization-level outcomes are achieved is missing. To investigate how, why and under which circumstances LDPs for physicians can impact organization-level outcomes. We conducted a realist review, following the RAMESES guidelines. Scientific articles and grey literature published between January 2010 and March 2021 evaluating a leadership intervention for physicians in the hospital setting were considered for inclusion. The following databases were searched: Medline, PsycInfo, ERIC, Web of Science, and Academic Search Premier. Based on the included documents, we developed a LDP middle-range program theory (MRPT) consisting of Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations (CMOs) describing how specific contexts (C) trigger certain mechanisms (M) to generate organization-level outcomes (O). In total, 3904 titles and abstracts and, subsequently, 100 full-text documents were inspected; 38 documents with LDPs from multiple countries informed our MRPT. The MRPT includes five CMOs that describe how LDPs can impact the organization-level outcomes categories 'culture', 'quality improvement', and 'the leadership pipeline': 'Acquiring self-insight and people skills (CMO1)', 'Intentionally building professional networks (CMO2)', 'Supporting quality improvement projects (CMO3)', 'Tailored LDP content prepares physicians (CMO4)', and 'Valuing physician leaders and organizational commitment (CMO5)'. Culture was the outcome of CMO1 and CMO2, quality improvement of CMO2 and CMO3, and the leadership pipeline of CMO2, CMO4, and CMO5. These CMOs operated within an overarching context, the leadership ecosystem, that determined realizing and sustaining organization-level outcomes. LDPs benefit organization-level outcomes through multiple mechanisms. Creating the contexts to trigger these mechanisms depends on the resources invested in LDPs and adequately supporting physicians. LDP providers can use the presented MRPT to guide the development of LDPs when aiming for specific organization-level outcomes.},

Understanding patients' and physicians' perspectives on compassionate care may provide insights that can be used to foster physicians' ability to respond to patients' compassion needs. Therefore, this study aims to understand how both patients and physicians experience the concept and practice of compassionate care. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight patients and ten resident physicians at a University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Using thematic analysis, we separately coded patient and resident transcripts to identify themes capturing their experiences of compassionate care. This study was part of a larger project to develop an educational intervention to improve compassion in residents. For both patients and residents, we identified four themes encompassing compassionate care: being there, empathizing, actions to relieve patients' suffering, and connection. For residents, a fifth theme was professional fulfillment (resulting from compassionate care). Although patients and residents both emphasized the importance of compassionate care, patients did not always perceive the physician-patient encounter as compassionate. According to residents, high workloads and time pressures hindered their ability to provide compassionate care. Patients and residents have similar and varying understandings of compassionate care at the same time. Understanding these differences can aid compassion in medical practice. Based on the findings, three topics are suggested to improve compassion in residents: (1) train residents how to ask for patients' compassion needs, (2) address residents' limiting beliefs about the concept and practice of compassion, and (3) acknowledge the art and science of medicine cannot be separated.},

We here propose a magnetic resonance imaging temperature mapping method in which drug delivery systems serve not only to improve tumor targeting, but also as an accurate and absolute nano-thermometer. This method is based on the temperature-dependent chemical shift difference between water protons and the protons in different groups of drug delivery systems. We show that the chemical shift of the protons in the ethylene oxide group in polyethylene glycol (PEG) is temperature-independent, whereas the proton resonance of water decreases with increasing temperature. The frequency difference between both resonances is linear and does not depend on pH and physiological salt conditions. In addition, we show that the proton resonance of the methyl group in N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide (HPMA) is temperature-independent. Therefore, PEGylated liposomes, polymeric mPEG-b-pHPMAm-Lac2 micelles and HPMA copolymers can provide a temperature-independent reference frequency for absolute magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry. Subsequently, we show that multigradient echo MR imaging with PEGylated liposomes in situ allows accurate, time-resolved temperature mapping. In conclusion, nanocarrier materials may serve as highly versatile tools for tumor-targeted drug delivery, acting not only as hyperthermia-responsive drug delivery systems, but also as accurate and precise nano-thermometers.},

Consistent with previous reports, rs429358 (apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4) is associated with lower odds of surviving to the 90th and 99th percentile age, while rs7412 (ApoE ε2) shows the opposite. Moreover, rs7676745, located near GPR78, associates with lower odds of surviving to the 90th percentile age. Gene-level association analysis reveals a role for tissue-specific expression of multiple genes in longevity. Finally, genetic correlation of the longevity GWA results with that of several disease-related phenotypes points to a shared genetic architecture between health and longevity.},

This prospective cohort study is part of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence (ENIGI). At the Ghent and Amsterdam sites, we included 625 hormone-naïve trans persons. Gender-affirming hormonal treatment was initiated at the first visit. In trans men, serum hematocrit (Hct) levels increased during the first year (+4.9 Hct %, 95% CI 3.82-5.25), with the most pronounced increase during the first 3 months (+2.7 Hct %, 95% CI 1.94-3.29). Trans men receiving testosterone esters had a larger increase in serum hematocrit levels compared to trans men receiving testosterone undecanoate (Δ 0.8 Hct %). Of 192 trans men, 22 (11.5%) developed serum hematocrit levels ≥50.0%. Trans men on testosterone undecanoate were less likely to develop hematocrit levels ≥50% or ≥52%, compared to trans men on testosterone esters, and were less likely to develop hematocrit levels ≥50%, compared to trans men on testosterone gel. In trans women, serum hematocrit had dropped by 4.1 Hct % (95% CI 3.50-4.37) after 3 months, after which only small decreases were observed. In conclusion, serum hematocrit levels can be found in the reference range of the perceived gender as from 3 months after the initiation of gender-affirming hormonal treatment.},

PALLAS was an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III trial, representing a public-private partnership between Pfizer, the Austrian Breast Cancer Study Group, and the U.S. ALLIANCE Foundation. Patients diagnosed with stage II-III, hormone-receptor-positive, HER2/neu negative breast cancer within 12 months of diagnosis had completed all definitive therapy aside from endocrine therapy (started within 6 months prior to study entry) were eligible. All patients were required to submit a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor block. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (of physicians' choice) for at least 5 years with or without 2 years of palbociclib, administered orally at a starting dose of 125 mg daily, given for 21 days followed by a 7-day break. A total of 5,796 patients with HR + /HER2- early breast cancer (including 1,010 with stage IIA) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 50 months for stage IIA patients and 43.1 months overall. In the stage IIA cohort, 4-year iDFS in the palbociclib arm was 92.9% versus 92.1% for ET alone (HR 0.75, 95%CI 0.48-1.19, p = 0.23). There was no differential benefit by histologic grade, chemotherapy receipt, age, or anatomic/clinical risk. Additionally, no benefit to palbociclib was seen in this cohort in invasive breast cancer-free survival (iBCFS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS), distant relapse-free survival (DRFS), or overall survival (OS). For the stage IIB/III patients, 4-year iDFS was 85.3% for palbociclib + ET versus 83.6% for ET alone (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77-1.07, p = 0.24). While there were substantial differences in outcome for stage IIA versus IIB/III patients at 4 years of follow-up, the addition of 2 years of palbociclib did not improve outcomes for patients, regardless of stage.

Under empagliflozin, all GSDIb individuals reported improved quality-of-life-scores. Neutrophil dysfunction related symptoms allowed either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor cessation or tapering. Calculated cost savings per patient per year ranged between € 6482-14 190 (NL) and € 1281-41 231 (AT). The budget impact analysis estimated annual total cost savings ranging between € 75 062-225 716 (NL) and € 37 697-231 790 (AT), based on conservative assumptions. The systematic benefit-risk assessment was favorable. From a VBHC perspective, empagliflozin treatment in GSDIb improved personal and clinical outcomes while saving costs, thereby creating value at multiple pillars. We emphasize the importance to reimburse empagliflozin for GSDIb individuals, further supported by the favorable systematic benefit-risk assessment. These observations in similar directions in two countries/health care systems strongly suggest that our findings can be extrapolated to other geographical areas and health care systems.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing comparisons between the Latarjet procedure and arthroscopic Bankart repair with remplissage (ABRR) is clinically relevant given their overlapping indications and potential as viable surgical options for recurrent anterior shoulder instability. However, previous systematic reviews have exclusively focused on the open Latarjet (OL) approach and included follow-up durations of less than 2 years. Therefore, purpose of this systematic review is to compare mid- to long-term clinical outcomes of ABRR versus both the OL and the arthroscopic Latarjet (AL) procedures across a wide range of glenoid bone loss to further enhance surgical decision-making. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, for studies published between 2014 and 2024. Studies that compared outcomes between ABRR and either OL or AL and had a minimum clinical follow-up of 2 years were included. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), range of motion (ROM), and recurrent instability, revision, and complication rates were collected. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Meta-analyses were conducted using R with the "Metafor" package. Of the 5,005 abstracts screened, 6 studies were included. Three hundred thirty-three patients underwent ABRR (mean age 27.3 ± 8.3 years, 22.4% female) and 468 underwent OL or AL (mean age 28.4 ± 9.2 years, 20.1% female). PROMs and ROM improved postoperatively across both groups but demonstrated high heterogeneity. The ABRR group had significantly higher single assessment numeric evaluation scores (92.5 ± 12 vs. 89.1 ± 12.2,  When compared across a wide range of glenoid bone loss levels, both ABRR and Latarjet procedures are effective for managing anterior shoulder instability, with comparably high PROMs and no significant differences in ROM. ABRR offers a safer surgical risk profile with significantly fewer complications and is a viable option in the appropriate patient population. However, there is likely a limit of glenoid bone loss at which ABRR may not be safely performed due to the elevated risk of recurrent instability.},

  abstract = {It has been more than 50 years since the first successful surgical reconstruction of esophageal atresia was performed in The Netherlands. We reviewed the historical changes in management and treatment results of patients born with esophageal atresia. We developed and analyzed a database of 371 consecutive patients treated for esophageal atresia in our center between 1947 and 2000. The mean birthweight decreased from 2,723 g (1947 to 1968) to 2,494 g (1994 to 2000), the mean gestational age decreased from 39 weeks (1947 to 1968) to 37 weeks (1994 to 2000). The number of patients with associated congenital malformations increased from 34% (1947 to 1968) to 66% (1994 to 2000). Most patients underwent primary repair of their atresia. Clinically significant tracheomalacia was present in 34 of 269 patients (13%). Gastroesophageal reflux was present in 90 of 277 patients (33%). Mortality decreased from 61% (1947 to 1968) to 11% (1994 to 2000). The patients who are treated nowadays for esophageal atresia in a pediatric surgical center are born earlier, weigh less, and have more associated anomalies than those treated 50 years ago. Still, the mortality rate is much lower thanks to earlier diagnosis, better supportive care and improved surgical techniques. Therefore, further significant reduction will be difficult to achieve.},

Prospective analysis of the prevalence of GER and its complications over 28 years after correction of EA by means of a questionnaire, esophagogastroscopy, and histologic evaluation of esophageal biopsies. The questionnaire was returned by 38 (95%) of 40 patients. A quarter of the patients had no complaints. Swallowing solid food was a problem for 13 patients (34%), and mashed foods for 2 (5%). Heartburn was experienced by 7 patients (18%), retrosternal pain by 8 (21%). However, none of the patients were using antireflux medication. Twenty-three patients (61%) agreed to undergo esophagogastroscopy, which showed macroscopic Barrett esophagus in 1 patient, which was confirmed by histology. One patient developed complaints of dysphagia at the end of the study. A squamous cell esophageal carcinoma was diagnosed and treated by transthoracic subtotal esophagectomy. This study shows a high incidence of GER-related complications after correction of EA, but it is still very disputable if all EA patients should be screened at an adult age.},

  abstract = {Kid, the toxin of the parD (kis, kid) maintenance system of plasmid R1, is an endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves RNA at the 5' of A in the core sequence 5'-UA(A/C)-3'. A model of the Kid toxin interacting with the uncleavable mimetic 5'-AdUACA-3' is available. To evaluate this model, a significant collection of mutants in some of the key residues proposed to be involved in RNA binding (T46, A55, T69 and R85) or RNA cleavage (R73, D75 and H17) were analysed by mass spectrometry in RNA binding and cleavage assays. A pair of substrates, 5'-AUACA-3', and its uncleavable mimetic 5'-AdUACA-3', used to establish the model and structure of the Kid-RNA complex, were used in both the RNA cleavage and binding assays. A second RNA substrate, 5'-UUACU-3' efficiently cleaved by Kid both in vivo and in vitro, was also used in the cleavage assays. Compared with the wild-type protein, mutations in the residues of the catalytic site abolished RNA cleavage without substantially altering RNA binding. Mutations in residues proposed to be involved in RNA binding show reduced binding efficiency and a corresponding decrease in RNA cleavage efficiency. The cleavage profiles of the different mutants were similar with the two substrates used, but RNA cleavage required much lower protein concentrations when the 5'-UUACU-3' substrate was used. Protein synthesis and growth assays are consistent with there being a correlation between the RNase activity of Kid and its inhibitory potential. These results give important support to the available models of Kid RNase and the Kid-RNA complex.},

Pulsed-field gradient NMR spectroscopy allows one to measure the translational diffusion with high accuracy. Two-dimensional (2D) heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy combined with diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) provides improved resolution and therefore selectivity when compared with a conventional 1D readout. Here, we show that a combination of selective isotope labelling, 2D ¹H-¹³C methyl-TROSY (transverse relaxation-optimised spectroscopy) and DOSY allows one to study diffusion properties of large protein complexes. We propose that a 3D DOSY-heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) pulse sequence, that uses the TROSY effect of the HMQC sequence for ¹³C methyl-labelled proteins, is highly suitable for measuring the diffusion coefficient of large proteins. We used the 20 kDa co-chaperone p23 as model system to test this 3D DOSY-TROSY technique under various conditions. We determined the diffusion coefficient of p23 in viscous solutions, mimicking large complexes of up to 200 kDa. We found the experimental data to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. To demonstrate the use for complex formation, we applied this technique to record the formation of a complex of p23 with the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which is around 200 kDa. We anticipate that 3D DOSY-TROSY will be a useful tool to study conformational changes in large protein complexes.},

Boelens and A. M. J. J. Bonvin (2003) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 125, 1731-1737] to explicitly deal with DNA flexibility. HADDOCK uses non-structural experimental data to drive the docking during a rigid-body energy minimization, and semi-flexible and water refinement stages. The latter allow for flexibility of all DNA nucleotides and the residues of the protein at the predicted interface. We evaluated our approach on the monomeric repressor-DNA complexes formed by bacteriophage 434 Cro, the Escherichia coli Lac headpiece and bacteriophage P22 Arc. Starting from unbound proteins and canonical B-DNA we correctly predict the correct spatial disposition of the complexes and the specific conformation of the DNA in the published complexes. This information is subsequently used to generate a library of pre-bent and twisted DNA structures that served as input for a second docking round. The resulting top ranking solutions exhibit high similarity to the published complexes in terms of root mean square deviations, intermolecular contacts and DNA conformation. Our two-stage docking method is thus able to successfully predict protein-DNA complexes from unbound constituents using non-structural experimental data to drive the docking.},

  abstract = {Maternal smoking and stress during pregnancy are associated with adverse health effects for women themselves and are risk factors for adverse developmental outcomes of the unborn child. Smoking and stress seem to be intertwined in various ways. First, the majority of smoking pregnant women is of lower socio-economic status, which is associated with higher levels of perceived stress. Second, smoking women often report to smoke because they feel stressed. Third, quitting smoking often increases perceived stress levels initially. Therefore, effective interventions are needed to support women with smoking cessation by reducing stress. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention on stress reduction and smoking cessation. The Stress- and Smoke Free Start of Life (SSFSL) study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a personalized eHealth intervention with a control condition. Inclusion criteria for the women are: (1) > 18 years of age, (2) < 28 weeks pregnant at recruitment, (3) currently smoking. Consenting participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive an 8-week intervention delivered on their smartphone. The application includes psycho-education on pregnancy, stress, and smoking (cessation); stress-management training consisting of Heart Rate Variability-biofeedback; and a personalized stop-smoking-plan. Participants in the control condition will be invited to visit a webpage with information on pregnancy, stress, and smoking (cessation). Study outcomes will be collected via online questionnaires, at four timepoints: pre-intervention (baseline; t0), post-intervention (8 weeks + 1 day after t0; t1), follow up at two weeks after birth (t2), and follow up at three months after birth (t3). The primary outcome measure is self-reported smoking cessation. Secondary outcomes include daily self-reported number of cigarettes smoked, perceived stress, pregnancy experience, birth outcomes, and negative affectivity scores of the baby. Moreover, the mediating effect of stress reduction on smoking cessation will be examined, and possible moderators will be tested. If the eHealth intervention is effective in smoking cessation among pregnant smoking women, it can be implemented as a tool into the health care in the Netherlands.

In a collaboration between physicians and patient associations, a questionnaire was developed, covering various domains of JIA care, including demographics, diagnosis, referrals to various health care professionals, access to pain and fatigue management and support groups, information they received about the disease and awareness of and participation in research. The questionnaire was translated and distributed by parent associations and pediatric rheumatologists in 25 countries, 22 of which were European. After completion the replies were entered on the PRINTO website. Replies could either be entered directly by parents on the website or on paper. In these cases, the replies were scanned and emailed by local hospital staff to Utrecht where they were entered by I.R. in the database. The survey was completed by 622 parents in 23 countries. The majority (66.7%) of patients were female, with median age 10-11 years at the completion of the questionnaire. Frequencies of self-reported JIA categories corresponded to literature. Some patients had never been referred to the ophthalmologist (22.8%) or physiotherapist (31.7%). Low rates of referral or access to fatigue (3.5%) or pain management teams (10.0%), age appropriate disease education (11.3%), special rehabilitation (13.7%) and support groups (20.1%) were observed. Many patients indicated they did not have contact details for urgent advice (35.9%) and did not receive information about immunizations (43.2%), research (55.6%) existence of transition of care clinics (89,2%) or financial support (89.7%). While on immunosuppressive drugs, about one half of patients did not receive information about immunizations, travelling, possible infections or how to deal with chickenpox or shingles. Low rates of referral to health care professionals may be due to children whose illness is well managed and who do not need additional support or information. Improvements are needed, especially in the areas of supportive care and information patients receive. It is also important to improve doctor patient communication between visits. Physicians can be instrumental in the setting up of support groups and increasing patients' awareness of existing support. Suggestions are given to convey crucial pieces of information structurally and repeatedly to ensure, among other things, compliance.},

  abstract = {Mitochondrial morphological dynamics affect the outcome of ischemic heart damage and pathogenesis. Recently, mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) has been identified as a mediator of mitochondrial morphological changes and cell death during cardiac ischemic injury. In this study, we report a unique relationship between Pim-1 activity and Drp1 regulation of mitochondrial morphology in cardiomyocytes challenged by ischemic stress. Transgenic hearts overexpressing cardiac Pim-1 display reduction of total Drp1 protein levels, increased phosphorylation of Drp1-(S637), and inhibition of Drp1 localization to the mitochondria. Consistent with these findings, adenoviral-induced Pim-1 neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) retain a reticular mitochondrial phenotype after simulated ischemia (sI) and decreased Drp1 mitochondrial sequestration. Interestingly, adenovirus Pim-dominant negative NRCMs show increased expression of Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only protein p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), which has been previously shown to induce Drp1 accumulation at mitochondria and increase sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Overexpression of the p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis-dominant negative adenovirus attenuates localization of Drp1 to mitochondria in adenovirus Pim-dominant negative NRCMs promotes reticular mitochondrial morphology and inhibits cell death during sI. Therefore, Pim-1 activity prevents Drp1 compartmentalization to the mitochondria and preserves reticular mitochondrial morphology in response to sI.},

  abstract = {The senescent cardiac phenotype is accompanied by changes in mitochondrial function and biogenesis causing impairment in energy provision. The relationship between myocardial senescence and Pim kinases deserves attention because Pim-1 kinase is cardioprotective, in part, by preservation of mitochondrial integrity. Study of the pathological effects resulting from genetic deletion of all Pim kinase family members could provide important insight about cardiac mitochondrial biology and the aging phenotype. To demonstrate that myocardial senescence is promoted by loss of Pim leading to premature aging and aberrant mitochondrial function. Cardiac myocyte senescence was evident at 3 months in Pim triple knockout mice, where all 3 isoforms of Pim kinase family members are genetically deleted. Cellular hypertrophic remodeling and fetal gene program activation were followed by heart failure at 6 months in Pim triple knockout mice. Metabolic dysfunction is an underlying cause of cardiac senescence and instigates a decline in cardiac function. Altered mitochondrial morphology is evident consequential to Pim deletion together with decreased ATP levels and increased phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase, exposing an energy deficiency in Pim triple knockout mice. Expression of the genes encoding master regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis, PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) coactivator-1 α and β, was diminished in Pim triple knockout hearts, as were downstream targets included in mitochondrial energy transduction, including fatty acid oxidation. Reversal of the dysregulated metabolic phenotype was observed by overexpressing c-Myc (Myc proto-oncogene protein), a downstream target of Pim kinases. Pim kinases prevent premature cardiac aging and maintain a healthy pool of functional mitochondria leading to efficient cellular energetics.},

In ten healthy volunteers we carried out a study to establish the method with which artefacts can most reliably be identified. Automatic detection of increasing signal intensity misinterpreted 14% of all artifacts as emboli; 1.7% of all artifacts sounded suspicious for embolism, and 0.6% met the classical criteria of an embolus. Using simultaneous recording of the flow signal in two sections of the middle cerebral artery, all artifacts were identified on the basis of their simultaneous manifestation. Reliable intra-operative differentiation of emboli from artifacts requires attentive, continuous acoustic and visual analysis of signals by an experienced investigator familiar with the surgical procedure. The introduction of a multiple-depth algorithm might significantly improve the automatic detection program.},

A secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial of a physical activity behavioural intervention (#NCT03111030). General community. Adults with chronic SCI (n = 14). An introductory behavioural coaching session followed by eight, weekly follow-up sessions were delivered in-person or by phone/video call. The interventionist utilized behaviour-change techniques tailored to individual participants' readiness for change, barriers, and preferences. Participants set goals for achieving the SCI exercise guidelines. Coaching sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Changes over time in the number of barriers reported within each level of a social-ecological model of influences on physical activity (intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, policy). A total of 152 physical activity barriers were identified across 122 coaching sessions. Within each level of influence, the number of identified barriers decreased significantly over the intervention period. Intrapersonal barriers (e.g., lack of motivation, low self-efficacy) were most frequently reported and showed the greatest reductions over time. Using a new coding method to track changes in physical activity barriers, this pilot project showed a significant decrease in barriers over the course of a counselling intervention. Understanding physical activity barrier dynamics can improve the design of physical activity-enhancing interventions. Dynamic barrier-tracking methods could also be used to improve intervention implementation and evaluation.},

We tested the hypothesis that ENaC within the cardiac sensory network are mandatory for mechanosensation. Experiments were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats, isolated nodose ganglion cells with cardiac afferents and isolated vagus nerves. Epicardial delivery of the amiloride analogue benzamil intended to specifically inhibit ENaC presumably located on cardiac sensory afferents indeed blunted the mechanosensitive (i. e., sympathoinhibition by intravenous volume loading [-32% and -42% in treated groups vs. -67% in controls; n = 7 each; p < 0.05]) as well as-though to a lesser extent-the 5-HT(3)-mediated chemosensitive cardiorenal reflex in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Using patch clamp technique, however, it turned out that neither amiloride nor benzamil influenced mechanically induced currents in ganglion nodosum cells in vitro, stimulated by hypoosmotic stress. The unspecific stretch activated ion channel blocker gadolinium completely abolished mechanically induced currents, indicating respective cells were mechanosensitive. In isolated vagus nerves benzamil impaired action potentials obtained by electrical stimulation (C-spike amplitude [-33%]; latency [+12%]; n = 8; p < 0.05). Our findings at least cast doubt on ENaC exclusively playing a specific role as mechanotransducers within the cardiac sensory network. Other ion channels might be involved. Furthermore the observed findings in vivo could also be due to unspecific disturbance of afferent signal conduction.},

Women and men had a 31.4% and 23.7% incidence of PDPH, respectively; these were not significantly different (P = 0.38).  Neither were rates of PDPH in Caucasians (28.0%) and African-Americans (15.6%) significantly different (P = 0.18)   Healthy controls had a higher incidence of PDPH than patients with PTSD (P = 0.032).  Smokers had a lower incidence of PDPH than non-smokers, 13.7% vs. 34.1% (P = 0.009).    This was not a prospective study, rather a retrospective chart review.    Most notably, smokers had a considerably reduced rate of PDPH in comparison with non-smokers.  This information could be a useful addition to the clinical assessment of relative risk for PDPH.  Further research into the mechanisms by which tobacco smoking may inhibit PDPH, such as nicotine stimulation of dopamine neurotransmission or alterations in coagulation, appears warranted.},

Within the IF2 molecule subdomain G3, which is believed to play an important role in the IF2-30S interaction, is positioned between the GTP-binding G2 and the fMet-tRNA binding C-terminal subdomains. In this study the solution structure of subdomain G3 of Geobacillus stearothermophilus IF2 has been elucidated. G3 forms a core structure consisting of two β-sheets with each four anti-parallel strands, followed by a C-terminal α-helix. In line with its role as linker between G3 and subdomain C1, this helix has no well-defined orientation but is endowed with a dynamic nature. The structure of the G3 core is that of a typical OB-fold module, similar to that of the corresponding subdomain of Thermus thermophilus IF2, and to that of other known RNA-binding modules such as IF2-C2, IF1 and subdomains II of elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G. Structural comparisons have resulted in a model that describes the interaction between IF2-G3 and the 30S ribosomal subunit.},

Neither Hrd1 nor ERAD has been studied in the heart, or in cardiac myocytes, where protein quality control is critical for proper heart function. The objective of this study were to elucidate roles for Hrd1 in ER stress, ERAD, and viability in cultured cardiac myocytes and in the mouse heart, in vivo. The effects of small interfering RNA-mediated Hrd1 knockdown were examined in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. The effects of adeno-associated virus-mediated Hrd1 knockdown and overexpression were examined in the hearts of mice subjected to pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy, which challenges protein-folding capacity. In cardiac myocytes, the ER stressors, thapsigargin and tunicamycin increased ERAD, as well as adaptive ER stress proteins, and minimally affected cell death. However, when Hrd1 was knocked down, thapsigargin and tunicamycin dramatically decreased ERAD, while increasing maladaptive ER stress proteins and cell death. In vivo, Hrd1 knockdown exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and increased apoptosis and cardiac hypertrophy, whereas Hrd1 overexpression preserved cardiac function and decreased apoptosis and attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in the hearts of mice subjected to pressure overload. Hrd1 and ERAD are essential components of the adaptive ER stress response in cardiac myocytes. Hrd1 contributes to preserving heart structure and function in a mouse model of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.},

Deletion of S100A4 increased cardiac damage after myocardial infarction, whereas cardiac myocyte-specific overexpression of S100A4 protected the infarcted myocardium. Decreased cardiac function in S100A4 Knockout mice was accompanied with increased cardiac remodeling, fibrosis, and diminished capillary density in the remote myocardium. Loss of S100A4 caused increased apoptotic cell death both in vitro and in vivo in part mediated by decreased VEGF expression. Conversely, S100A4 overexpression protected cells against apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Increased pro-survival AKT-signaling explained reduced apoptosis in S100A4 overexpressing cells.

  abstract = {Gene expression profiles have been mainly determined by analysis of transcript abundance. However, these analyses cannot capture posttranscriptional gene expression control at the level of translation, which is a key step in the regulation of gene expression, as evidenced by the fact that transcript levels often poorly correlate with protein levels. Furthermore, genome-wide transcript profiling of distinct cell types is challenging due to the fact that lysates from tissues always represent a mixture of cells. This study aimed to develop a new experimental method that overcomes both limitations and to apply this method to perform a genome-wide analysis of gene expression on the translational level in response to pressure overload. By combining ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) with a ribosome-tagging approach (Ribo-tag), it was possible to determine the translated transcriptome in specific cell types from the heart. After pressure overload, we monitored the cardiac myocyte translatome by purifying tagged cardiac myocyte ribosomes from cardiac lysates and subjecting the ribosome-protected mRNA fragments to deep sequencing. We identified subsets of mRNAs that are regulated at the translational level and found that translational control determines early changes in gene expression in response to cardiac stress in cardiac myocytes. Translationally controlled transcripts are associated with specific biological processes related to translation, protein quality control, and metabolism. Mechanistically, Ribo-seq allowed for the identification of upstream open reading frames in transcripts, which we predict to be important regulators of translation. This method has the potential to (1) provide a new tool for studying cell-specific gene expression at the level of translation in tissues, (2) reveal new therapeutic targets to prevent cellular remodeling, and (3) trigger follow-up studies that address both, the molecular mechanisms involved in the posttranscriptional control of gene expression in cardiac cells, and the protective functions of proteins expressed in response to cellular stress.},

While Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and WNT signaling pathways are crucial for ETMR pathogenesis, the impact of these pathways on human IO-MEPL development is unclear. Gene expression analyses of human embryonal tumor samples revealed similar gene expression patterns and significant overrepresentation of SHH and WNT target genes in both IO-MEPL and ETMR. In order to unravel the function of Shh and Wnt signaling for IO-MEPL pathogenesis in vivo, both pathways were activated in retinal precursor cells in a time point specific manner. Shh and Wnt co-activation in early Sox2- or Rax-expressing precursor cells resulted in infiltrative ocular lesions that displayed extraretinal expansion. Histomorphological, immunohistochemical, and molecular features showed a strong concordance with human IO-MEPL. We demonstrate a relevant role of WNT and SHH signaling in IO-MEPL and report the first mouse model to generate tumor-like lesions with features of IO-MEPL.

Since the introduction of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test tumors are diagnosed with a favorable tumor stage and differentiation grade. Does screening with PSA just detect more tumors with favorable characteristics or is dedifferentiation actually being prevented by early detection and consequent treatment? The latter option implies that tumors dedifferentiate in the preclinical screen-detectable phase. To model the natural history of prostate cancer, we analyzed the age-specific distribution of clinical stage and Gleason score of 2,204 tumors diagnosed in the ERSPC-Rotterdam trial. We fitted 2 MISCAN simulation models to the observed data: Model I where tumors dedifferentiate before becoming screen-detectable and Model II where dedifferentiation occurs during the screen-detectable preclinical phase. The hypothesis of dedifferentiation during the screen-detectable phase was tested by a goodness of fit test of both models. In ERSPC-Rotterdam, we observed a significantly more favorable distribution of Gleason scores in screen-detected cancers compared to cancers found in the control arm, and in cancers detected in the second round compared to cancers detected in the first round of screening. Also, a significant association between Gleason score and age at diagnosis was found, most notably in cancers detected in the first round of screening. These findings were reproduced by Model II and less so by Model I, with a significant difference in goodness of fit between the 2 models (p < 0.001). This study provides epidemiological evidence of dedifferentiation as a major mechanism of progression in prostate cancer. Tumors dedifferentiate during the screen-detectable phase and consequently screening with PSA and early treatment can possibly prevent dedifferentiation.},

Men with moderate-to-severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms were treated for 12 weeks with a FDC of solifenacin 6 or 9 mg plus TOCAS (0.4 mg), TOCAS monotherapy (0.4 mg) or placebo in a randomised, double-blind study (NEPTUNE). The co-primary endpoints were Total Urgency Frequency Score (TUFS) and total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). HRQoL was assessed by several secondary endpoints: IPSS QoL index, overactive bladder questionnaire (OAB-q), and Patient Global Impression (PGI) scale. The correlation between symptom improvement (TUFS) and HRQoL was assessed by Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Single and double responder analyses, using subjective and objective measures, were also performed. In the responder analyses, men treated with a FDC of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS consistently had significantly improved outcomes compared with placebo (8/8 responder analyses performed) and TOCAS (6/8 responder analyses performed). There was a significant correlation (P < 0.001) between the reduction in TUFS and the improvement in HRQoL defined by IPSS QoL score, OAB-q symptom bother score, PGI overall bladder symptoms and PGI general health. In men with LUTS/BPH who have moderate-to-severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms, the reduction in symptoms with a once-daily FDC of solifenacin and TOCAS was associated with consistent patient-relevant improvements in HRQoL compared with placebo and TOCAS monotherapy.},

In total, 13 men (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.6%-1.8%) reported a UR event while receiving FDC, eight of which were AUR (0.7%; 95% CI, 0.3%-1.3%, incidence 7/1000 man-years). Six men reported UR events while taking Soli 6 mg + TOCAS (three AUR), and seven men reported a UR event while taking Soli 9 mg + TOCAS (five AUR). One man developed AUR while taking TOCAS alone and four reported UR (three AUR) during placebo run-in. Most AUR/UR events occurred within 4 months of treatment initiation. FDC Soli and TOCAS was associated with a low rate of UR and AUR in men with LUTS.},

Knowledge of cell volumetric mass density is important for experimental and numerical optimization of these procedures. Although methods for measuring cell volumetric mass density already exist, they either consume much time and cell material or require a special setup. Therefore, we developed a user-friendly method that is based on the use of readily available instrumentation. The newly developed method is predicated on the linear relationship between the volumetric mass density of the cell suspension and the volumetric mass density, number, and diameter of the cells in the suspension. We used this method to determine the volumetric mass density of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and compared it to results from the established density centrifugation.},

We performed a randomised, open label, parallel group, multi-centre trial in 3 Dutch teaching hospitals. Treatment was guided by a PCT algorithm, CRP algorithm or standard care. Participants were recruited by a member of the study team and randomised at day 2-3 of admission in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment was discontinued upon predefined thresholds of biomarkers that were assessed on admission, day 4 and days 5-7 if indicated. The primary outcome was total days on antibiotic treatment until day 30. In total 468 participants were included in this study. The median days on antibiotics (IQR) was 7 (IQR 7-10) in the control group, 4 (IQR 3-7) in the CRP group (rate ratio (RR) of 0.70, 95% CI 0.61-0.82 compared to standard care; p <0.001), and 5.5 (IQR 3-9) in the PCT group (RR of 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.89 compared to standard care; p <0.001).

At subnormal temperatures the former gave higher results than expected, and the latter, lower results. We found a similar effect for total protein determined by the manual biuret reaction at different temperatures, when results were calculated from calibration at a fixed temperature. Total bilirubin assayed by the manual diazobilirubin method showed no such effect.

We retrospectively compared our adult HTx performed with 2 different solutions, in terms of hospital mortality, mid-term survival, inotropic score, primary graft dysfunction and rejection score. From January 2009 to December 2020, 154 consecutive HTx of adult patients, followed up in pre- and post-transplantation by 2 different tertiary centres, were performed at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland. From 2009 to 2015, the cardiac preservation solution used was exclusively St-Thomas, whereafter an institutional decision was made to use HTK-Custodiol only. Patients were classified in 2 groups accordingly. There were 75 patients in the St-Thomas group and 79 patients in the HTK-Custodiol group. The 2 groups were comparable in terms of preoperative and intraoperative characteristics. Postoperatively, compared to the St-Thomas group, the Custodiol group patients showed significantly lower inotropic scores [median (interquartile range): 35.7 (17.5-60.2) vs 71.8 (31.8-127), P < 0.001], rejection scores [0.08 (0.0-0.25) vs 0.14 (0.05-0.5), P = 0.036] and 30-day mortality rate (2.5% vs 14.7%, P = 0.007) even after adjusting for potential confounders. Microscopic analysis of the endomyocardial biopsies also showed less specific histological features of subendothelial ischaemia (3.8% vs 17.3%, P = 0.006). There was no difference in primary graft dysfunction requiring postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The use of HTK-Custodiol solution significantly improved midterm survival (Custodiol versus St-Thomas: hazard ratio = 0.20, 95% confidence interval: 0.069-0.60, P = 0.004). This retrospective study comparing St-Thomas solution and HTK-Custodiol as myocardial protection during heart procurement showed that Custodiol improves outcomes after HTx, including postoperative inotropic score, rejection score, 30-day mortality and midterm survival.},

  abstract = {The codling moth, Cydia pomonella L. (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae), is a major pest of apple, pear and walnut orchards worldwide. This pest is often controlled using the biologically friendly control method known as pheromone-based mating disruption. Mating disruption likely exerts selection on the sexual communication system of codling moth, as male and female moths will persist in their attempt to meet and mate. Surprisingly little is known on the intraspecific variation of sexual communication in this species. We started an investigation to determine the level of individual variation in the female sex pheromone composition of this moth and whether variation among different populations might be correlated with use of mating disruption against those populations. By extracting pheromone glands of individual females from a laboratory population in Canada and from populations from apple orchards in Spain and Italy, we found significant between- and within-population variation. Comparing females that had been exposed to mating disruption, or not, revealed a significant difference in sex pheromone composition for two of the minor components. Overall, the intraspecific variation observed shows the potential for a shift in female sexual signal when selection pressure is high, as is the case with continuous use of mating disruption.},

  abstract = {Individuals can make choices based on information learned from others, a phenomenon called social learning. How observers differentiate between which individual they should or should not learn from is, however, poorly understood. Here, we showed that Drosophila melanogaster females can influence the choice of egg-laying site of other females through pheromonal marking. Mated females mark territories of high quality food by ejecting surplus male sperm containing the aggregation pheromone cis-11-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) and, in addition, deposit several sex- and species-specific cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) pheromones. These pheromonal cues affect the choices of other females, which respond by preferentially laying eggs on the marked food. This system benefits both senders and responders, as communal egg laying increases offspring survival. Virgin females, however, do not elicit a change in the egg-laying decision of mated females, even when food has been supplemented with ejected sperm from mated females, thus indicating the necessity for additional cues. Genetic ablation of either a female's CHC pheromones or those of their mate results in loss of ability of mated females to attract other females. We conclude that mated females use a pheromonal marking system, comprising cVA acquired from male ejaculate with sex- and species-specific CHCs produced by both mates, to indicate egg-laying sites. This system ensures information reliability because mated, but not virgin, females have both the ability to generate the pheromone blend that attracts other flies to those sites and a direct interest in egg-laying site quality.},

In this multi-site retrospective study, participating sites submitted the numbers of platelet and plasma transfusions administered during a 2-year period categorized by patient and product ABO group. Fourteen sites from 10 countries participated. Group O patients received Group AB for an average of 9.9% (range 2.8%-29.2%) of plasma transfusions and Group B for 3.2% (0%-12.8%). AB plasma transfusion to Group O patients represented 4.5% (0.9%-14.6%) of the total plasma transfused; Group B 1.4% (0%-5.1%). Group O patients received Group AB for an average of 1.5% (range 0%-5.9%) of platelet transfusions and Group B for 4.1% (0%-14.2%). AB platelet transfusion to Group O patients represented 0.6% (0%-2.7%) of the total platelets transfused; Group B platelets were 1.8% (0%-6.7%). Evidence supporting the possibility of a new adverse event, TRAGS, is accumulating. This study quantifies how often Group O patients may be exposed to Group B antigen in Group B or AB plasma and/or platelet transfusions, providing an estimate of the scope of potential risk for TRAGS.},

Pim1 is a cardioprotective kinase that antagonizes the aging phenotype of cardiomyocytes and delays cellular senescence by maintaining telomere length, but the mechanism remains unknown. Another pathway responsible for regulating telomere length is the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signalling pathway where inhibiting TGFβ signalling maintains telomere length. The relationship between Pim1 and TGFβ has not been explored. This study delineates the mechanism of telomere length regulation by the interplay between Pim1 and components of TGFβ signalling pathways in proliferating A549 cells and post-mitotic cardiomyocytes. Telomere length was maintained by lentiviral-mediated overexpression of PIM1 and inhibition of TGFβ signalling in A549 cells. Telomere length maintenance was further demonstrated in isolated cardiomyocytes from mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of PIM1 and by pharmacological inhibition of TGFβ signalling. Mechanistically, Pim1 inhibited phosphorylation of Smad2, preventing its translocation into the nucleus and repressing expression of TGFβ pathway genes. Pim1 maintains telomere lengths in cardiomyocytes by inhibiting phosphorylation of the TGFβ pathway downstream effectors Smad2 and Smad3, which prevents repression of telomerase reverse transcriptase. Findings from this study demonstrate a novel mechanism of telomere length maintenance and provide a potential target for preserving cardiac function.},

Here we describe a cardiac protein named Myoscape/FAM40B/STRIP2, which directly interacts with the L-type calcium channel. Knockdown of Myoscape in cardiomyocytes decreases calcium transients associated with smaller Ca(2+) amplitudes and a lower diastolic Ca(2+) content. Likewise, L-type calcium channel currents are significantly diminished on Myoscape ablation, and downregulation of Myoscape significantly reduces contractility of cardiomyocytes. Conversely, overexpression of Myoscape increases global Ca(2+) transients and enhances L-type Ca(2+) channel currents, and is sufficient to restore decreased currents in failing cardiomyocytes. In vivo, both Myoscape-depleted morphant zebrafish and Myoscape knockout (KO) mice display impairment of cardiac function progressing to advanced heart failure. Mechanistically, Myoscape-deficient mice show reduced L-type Ca(2+)currents, cell capacity and calcium current densities as a result of diminished LTCC surface expression. Finally, Myoscape expression is reduced in hearts from patients suffering of terminal heart failure, implying a role in human disease.},

In experimental studies on subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) there are indications that perivascular peptides are involved. In the present study we have in man measured the levels of NPY, VIP, SP and CGRP in brain vessels of patients that have suffered a fatal SAH and compared this with the levels encountered in subjects that died of an extracerebral cause. MATERIAL AND METHODS--Vessels from patients who have died from SAH or nonSAH were obtained during autopsy performed within 24 hrs after death. The peptides were extracted and fractionated with reversed phase liquid chromatography (HPLC). The levels of NPY, VIP, SP, and CGRP were measured with radioimmunoassay. Vasomotor responses of human cerebral arteries were performed using a sensitive in vitro system. RESULTS--Human cerebral vessels contained NPY, VIP, CGRP and SP which eluted at the same positions as the authentic peptides. The level of CGRP was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in arteries removed from SAH patients as compared to control subjects. The level of SP was not changed, if anything it tended to be increased after SAH. The levels of NPY and VIP were not significantly altered after SAH. In isolated brain vessels alpha-CGRP was a potent vasodilator of arteries precontracted with whole blood, prostaglandin F2 alpha or endothelin. It had a poor effect on vessels precontracted with 60 mM potassium. CONCLUSION--The evidence suggest that the trigemino-cerebrovascular system, storing CGRP and SP, is to a differential degree involved in the pathophysiology of SAH in man and supports the hypothesis of an exhaustion of CGRP as one important factor in the development of late spasm occurring after SAH.},

  abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that water transport between the pulmonary vasculature and air spaces can be inhibited by HgCl2, an agent that inhibits water channels (aquaporin-1 and -5) of cell membranes. In the present study of isolated rat lungs, clearances of labeled (3HOH) and unlabeled water were compared after instillation of hypotonic or hypertonic solutions into the air spaces or injection of a hypotonic bolus into the pulmonary artery. The clearance of 3HOH between the air spaces and perfusate after intratracheal instillation and from the vasculature to the tissues after pulmonary arterial injections was invariably greater than that of unlabeled water, indicating that osmotically driven transport of water is limited by permeability of the tissue barriers rather than the rate of perfusion. Exposure to 0.5 mM HgCl2 in the perfusate and air-space solution reduced the product of the filtration coefficient and surface area (PfS) of water from the air spaces to the perfusate by 28% after instillation of water into the trachea. In contrast, perfusion of 0.5 mM HgCl2 in air-filled lungs reduced PfS of the endothelium by 86% after injections into the pulmonary artery, suggesting that much of the action of this inhibitor is on the endothelial surfaces. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that aquaporin-1 is on mouse pulmonary endothelium. No aquaporin-1 was found on alveolar type I cells with immunogold transmission electron microscopy, but small amounts were present on some type II cells.},

  abstract = {Phase-contrast cine MR flow imaging through the aqueduct was used to establish the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), and to predict outcome after shunting. From 1990-1994 16 patients, who were participants in the Dutch Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Study [3], were studied. The patients included in this study met clinical and CT-scan criteria as described in this study, underwent cine phase-contrast MR imaging prior to placement of a CSF shunt, and had a follow-up 12 months after the operation. Claustrophobic patients, patients with a pacemaker or extremely agitated patients were excluded. Normal Flux was calculated in each patients, as the average difference in caudal and rostral flux (Fdiff) +2 times standard deviation (0.97 cc/sec) [2]. The clinical outcome was measured with a modified scale of activities of daily living (ADL) as described by Rankin. Of the 16 patients, 8 could not be evaluated due to restlessness during MR measurements, disabling cerebral vascular accidents or death before the end of the follow-up period. Of the remaining 8 patients, 5 had a normal flux, of which only one improved. Two patients had a Fdiff twice the normal range, which improved in both patients. One patient had no measurable flux, consistent with an aqueduct stenosis; he too improved. Overall, there was a concordance of MR findings with final outcome after shunting in 7 out of 8 patients. This pilot study, therefore, support the need to further evaluate flow with MR imaging techniques to select patients with shunt responsive NPH.},

Nevertheless, the implications of this classification for patients with grade 2 meningiomas, a particularly heterogeneous tumor entity, are only partially understood. We correlate the outcomes of histopathologically confirmed grade 2 meningioma with an integrated molecular-morphologic risk stratification and determine its clinical implications. Grade 2 meningioma patients treated at our institution were re-classified using an integrated risk stratification involving DNA methylation array-based data, copy number assessment and TERT promoter mutation analyses. Grade 2 meningioma cases according to the WHO 2021 criteria treated between 2007 and 2021 (n = 100) were retrospectively analyzed. The median clinical and radiographic follow-up periods were 59.8 and 54.4 months. A total of 38 recurrences and 17 deaths were observed. The local control rates of the entire cohort after 2-, 4-, and 6-years were 84.3%, 68.5%, and 50.8%, with a median local control time of 77.2 months. The distribution of the integrated risk groups were as follows: 31 low, 54 intermediate, and 15 high risk cases. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, integrated risk groups were significantly associated with the risk of local recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) intermediate: 9.91, HR high-risk: 7.29, p < 0.01). Gross total resections decreased the risk of local tumor progression (HR gross total resection: 0.19, p < 0.01). The comparison of 1p status and integrated risk groups (low vs. intermediate/high) revealed nearly identical local control rates within their respective subgroups. In summary, only around 50% of WHO 2021 grade 2 meningiomas have an intermediate risk profile. Integrated molecular risk stratification is crucial to guide the management of patients with grade 2 tumors and should be routinely applied to avoid over- and undertreatment, especially concerning the use of adjuvant radiotherapy.},

Innovative interventions that address the underlying factors contributing to nonadherence are needed. Gamified mobile apps have shown promise in promoting behavior change and engagement. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and usability of a gamified mobile app that used a narrative storytelling approach to enhance medication adherence among patients following acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The study aimed to assess changes in participants' beliefs about medication and self-reported adherence before and after the intervention. Additionally, user feedback regarding the narrative component of the app was gathered. Overall, 18 patients who recently experienced ACS were recruited for a 1-month intervention using the gamified app. Participants' beliefs about medication and self-reported adherence were assessed using standardized scales pre- and postintervention. The app's usability was also evaluated through a postintervention questionnaire. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the significance of changes in belief and adherence scores. Although 33% (6/18) of the participants did not use the intervention more than once, the remaining 12 remained engaged during the 30 days of the study. The results did not indicate a significant improvement in participants' beliefs about medication following the intervention. However, self-reported adherence significantly improved (P<.05) after the intervention with a mean score going from 29.1 (SD 6.9) to 32.4 (SD 5.6), with participants demonstrating a greater self-efficacy to their prescribed medication regimen. However, the results did not indicate a significant improvement in participants' beliefs about medication. With a mean average score of 80.6, the usability evaluation indicates a good usability rating for the gamified app. However, the narrative storytelling component of the app was not favored by the participants, as indicated by their feedback. This pilot study suggests that a gamified mobile app using narration may effectively enhance medication self-efficacy and positively influence patients' beliefs about medication following ACS. However, the narrative component of the app did not receive favorable feedback from participants. Future research should focus on exploring alternative methods to engage participants in the app's narrative elements while maintaining the positive impact on adherence and beliefs about medication observed in this study.},

In this study, we used a questionnaire to determine the frequency of local and systemic adverse drug reactions in our patients who were treated with LIT between 2017 and 2020 (n = 302). In addition, we asked about pregnancies and/or live births after LIT in a 2-year follow-up (n = 140). Most of the patients reported the occurrence of mild local adverse drug reactions in a period of less than 4 weeks: Over 75% reported moderate erythema, itching or swelling, over 10% erythema, itching or swelling as more pronounced adverse drug reaction. Blistering was specified in 10% of the cases. Serious adverse drug reactions or adverse events were not described. In the follow-up, 69% of our patients stated a pregnancy after LIT, and 50% a life birth. Overall, LIT represents a well-tolerated therapy for couples with unexplained infertility, however, more evidence is needed on the benefits.},

Recent advancements in biologging increasingly allow for detailed measurements of the multifaceted nature of movement, from descriptors of animal movement trajectories (e.g., using GPS) to descriptors of body part movements (e.g., using tri-axial accelerometers). Because this multivariate richness of movement data complicates inference on the environmental influence on animal movement, studies generally use simplified movement descriptors in statistical analyses. However, doing so limits the inference on the environmental influence on movement, as this requires that the multivariate richness of movement data can be fully considered in an analysis. We propose a data-driven analytic framework, based on existing methods, to quantify the environmental influence on animal movement that can accommodate the multifaceted nature of animal movement. Instead of fitting a simplified movement descriptor to a suite of environmental variables, our proposed framework centres on predicting an environmental variable from the full set of multivariate movement data. The measure of fit of this prediction is taken to be the metric that quantifies how much of the environmental variation relates to the multivariate variation in animal movement. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework through a case study about the influence of grass availability and time since milking on cow movements using machine learning algorithms. We show that on a one-hour timescale 37% of the variation in grass availability and 33% of time since milking influenced cow movements. Grass availability mostly influenced the cows' neck movement during grazing, while time since milking mostly influenced the movement through the landscape and the shared variation of accelerometer and GPS data (e.g., activity patterns). Furthermore, this framework proved to be insensitive to spurious correlations between environmental variables in quantifying the influence on animal movement. Not only is our proposed framework well-suited to study the environmental influence on animal movement; we argue that it can also be applied in any field that uses multivariate biologging data, e.g., animal physiology, to study the relationships between animals and their environment. },

  abstract = {A gene-environment interaction between expression genotypes of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and adverse childhood experience increases the risk of antisocial behavior. However, the neural underpinnings of this interaction remain uninvestigated. A cortico-limbic circuit involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala is central to the suppression of aggressive impulses and is modulated by serotonin (5-HT). MAOA genotypes may modulate the vulnerability of this circuit and increase the risk for emotion regulation deficits after specific life events. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) challenges 5-HT regulation and may identify vulnerable neuronal circuits, contributing to the gene-environment interaction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging measured the resting-state state activity in 64 healthy males in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Cortical maps of amygdala correlation identified the impact of ATD and its interaction with low- (MAOA-L) and high-expression variants (MAOA-H) of MAOA on cortico-limbic connectivity. Across all Regions of Interest (ROIs) exhibiting an ATD effect on cortico-limbic connectivity, MAOA-L carriers were more susceptible to ATD than MAOA-H carriers. In particular, the MAOA-L group exhibited a larger reduction of amygdala connectivity with the right prefrontal cortex and a larger increase of amygdala connectivity with the insula and dorsal PCC. MAOA-L carriers were more susceptable to a central 5-HT challenge in cortico-limbic networks. Such vulnerability of the cortical serotonergic system may contribute to the emergence of antisocial behavior after systemic challenges, observed as gene-environment interaction.

  abstract = {Endocannabinoid peptides, or "pepcans," are endogenous ligands of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. Depending on their length, they display diverse activity: For instance, the nona-peptide Pepcan-9, also known as hemopressin, is a powerful inhibitor of CB1, whereas the longer variant Pepcan-12, which extends by only three amino acid residues at the N-terminus, acts on both CB1 and CB2 as an allosteric modulator, although with diverse effects. Despite active research on their pharmacological applications, very little is known about structure-activity relationships of pepcans. Different structures have been proposed for the nona-peptide, which has also been reported to form fibrillar aggregates. This might have affected the outcome and reproducibility of bioactivity studies. In an attempt of elucidating the determinants of both biological activity and aggregation propensity of Pepcan-9 and Pepcan-12, we have performed their structure characterization in solvent systems characterized by different polarity and pH. We have found that, while disordered in aqueous environment, both peptides display helical structure in less polar environment, mimicking the proteic receptor milieu. In the case of Pepcan-9, this structure is fully consistent with the observed modulation of the CB1. For Pepcan-12, whose allosteric binding site is still unknown, the presented structure is compatible with the binding at one of the previously proposed allosteric sites on CB1. These findings open the way to structure-driven design of selective peptide modulators of CB1.},

Yet, the calculated (15)N CSA tensors in phosphorylated model peptides were in range of values experimentally observed for non-phosphorylated proteins. The extent of the phosphorylation induced changes suggests that the amidic (15)N CSA tensor in phosphorylated proteins could be reasonably well approximated with averaged CSA tensor values experimentally determined for non-phosphorylated amino acids in practical NMR applications, where chemical surrounding of the phosphorylated site is not known a priori in majority of cases.

Data were collected from a treatment-seeking sample of trauma victims (n=158) and a college sample (n=178). The PTCI's three-factor structure was retained in both samples. The PTCI demonstrated high internal consistency and two-week test-retest reliability. Convergent validity was evidenced by a pattern of correlations with instruments for trauma-related cognitions, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depressive symptoms that largely met a priori expectations. Reductions in self-reported and clinician-assessed posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were positively associated with decreased PTCI scores, indicating that the PTCI could assist treatment evaluation.

These include leg ulcers with venous disease greatly prevailing arterial disease, diabetic foot syndrome, and pressure ulcers. Due to a considerable treatment resistance against such therapies, new and effective, additive treatment options especially for chronic wounds are needed. Wound treatment with cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) constitutes such an innovative option. Current research regarding the efficacy of cold plasma for healing of acute and chronic wounds is summarized. The literature on CAP applications in wound healing has been screened and reviewed. With CAP, several effects that promote wound healing can be simultaneously applied in one application. On the one hand, CAP exerts a strong and broad antimicrobial activity against biofilm. On the other hand, the plasma cocktail, which consists of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, UV, and charged particles (electrical current), mediates tissue-stimulating, blood flow-promoting, and anti-inflammatory effects. Marked germ reduction on wounds and accelerated wound healing have already been convincingly demonstrated in controlled clinical studies. The comprehensive CAP study landscape with structured case report summaries and randomized case-control studies allows the conclusion that CAP is safe, effective, and easy to handle for wound treatment. The utilization of CAP in addition to standard wound treatments is starting to enter routine clinical practice.},

Wounds, especially chronic wounds, affect 2% to 3% of the elderly population and comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases.

The hallmarks of modern wound treatment include debridement of dead tissue, disinfection, wound dressings that keep the wound moist but still allow air exchange, and compression bandages. Despite all these efforts there is still a huge treatment resistance and wounds will not heal. This calls for new and more efficient treatment options in combination with novel biocompatible skin scaffolds. Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) is such an innovative addition to the treatment armamentarium. In one CAP application, antimicrobial effects, wound acidification, enhanced microcirculations and cell stimulation can be achieved. It is evident that CAP treatment, in combination with novel bioengineered, biocompatible and biodegradable electrospun scaffolds, has the potential of fostering wound healing by promoting remodeling and epithelialization along such temporarily applied skin replacement scaffolds.},

This programme was designed to implement checklist-related improvement initiatives based on the national perioperative guidelines using a stepped-wedge trial design. A process analysis was carried out to investigate the involvement in the implementation activities. An involvement rating measure was developed to express the extent to which the implementation programme was carried out in the hospitals. This measure reflects the number of IMPROVE-implementation activities executed and the estimated participation in these activities in all nine participating hospitals. These data were compared with prospectively collected field notes. Considerable variation between the hospitals was found with involvement ratings ranging from 0 to 6 (mean per measurement = 1.83 on a scale of 0-11). Major implementation challenges were respectively the study design (fixed design, time planning, long duration, repeated measurements, and data availability); the selection process of hospitals, departments and key contact person(s) (inadequately covering the entire perioperative team and stand-alone surgeons); the implementation programme (programme size and scope, tailoring, multicentre, lack of mandate, co-interventions by the Inspectorate, local intervention initiatives, intervention fatigue); and competitive events such as hospital mergers or the introduction of new IT systems, all reducing involvement. The process analysis approach helped to explain the limited and delayed execution of the IMPROVE-implementation programme. This turned out to be very heterogeneous between hospitals, with variation in the number and content of implementation activities carried out. The identified implementation challenges reflect a high complexity with regard to the implementation programme, study design and setting. The involvement of the target professionals was put under pressure by many factors. We mostly encountered challenges, but at the same time we provide solutions for addressing them. A less complex implementation programme, a less fixed study design, a better thought-out selection of contact persons, as well as more commitment of the hospital management and surgeons would likely have contributed to better implementation results.

However, it is unknown to what extent epigenetic mechanisms are associated with PTSD and its neurobiology in youth. In this study, we combined a methylome-wide association study and structural neuroimaging measures in a Dutch cohort of youths with PTSD (8-18 years of age). We aimed to replicate findings in a similar independent U.S. cohort. We found significant methylome-wide associations for pediatric PTSD (false discovery rate p < .05) compared with non-PTSD control groups (traumatized and nontraumatized youths). Methylation differences on nine genes were replicated, including genes related to glucocorticoid functioning. In both cohorts, methylation on OLFM3 gene was further associated with anterior hippocampal volume. These findings point to molecular pathways involved in inflammation, stress response, and neuroplasticity as potential contributors to neural abnormalities and provide potentially unique biomarkers and treatment targets for pediatric PTSD.},

  abstract = {In youth with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) non-response rates after treatment are often high. Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAm) have previously been linked to PTSD pathogenesis, additionally DNAm may affect response to (psychological) therapies. Besides investigating the direct link between DNAm and treatment response, it might be helpful to investigate the link between DNAm and previously associated biological mechanisms with treatment outcome. Thereby gaining a deeper molecular understanding of how psychotherapy (reflecting a change in the environment) relates to epigenetic changes and the adaptability of individuals. To date, limited research is done in clinical samples and no studies have been conducted in youth. Therefore we conducted a study in a Dutch cohort of youth with and without PTSD (n = 87, age 8-18 years). We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of saliva-based genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) levels, and salivary cortisol secretion. The last might reflect possible abbreviations on the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA-axis is previously linked to DNAm and the development and recovery of PTSD. Youth were treated with 8 sessions of either Eye Movement Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR) or Trauma Focused Cognitive behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). Our epigenome wide approach showed distinct methylation between treatment responders and non-responders on C18orf63 gene post-treatment. This genomic region is related to the PAX5 gene, involved in neurodevelopment and inflammation response. Additionally, our targeted approach indicated that there were longitudinal DNAm changes in successfully treated youth at the CRHR2 gene. Methylation at this gene was further correlated with cortisol secretion pre- and post-treatment. Awaiting replication, findings of this first study in youth point to molecular pathways involved in stress response and neuroplasticity to be associated with treatment response.},

Although some information is available on its formation, the mechanisms involved in its degradation are not understood. Here, we present evidence for lysosomal digestion of type VI collagen by fibroblasts of periosteal explants. In the lysosomal apparatus of these cells, broad-banded filamentous aggregates characterized by 100-nm periodicity were found, which proved to consist of type VI collagen as indicated by their stainability with anti-type VI collagen antibodies. By interfering with synthesis (ascorbate or alpha, alpha-dipyridyl), intracellular translocation of collagen-containing vesicles (colchicine) as well as phagocytosis (cytochalasin B), it was shown that the intracellular broad-banded type VI collagen represented phagocytosed material. In the presence of acidotropic agents (NH4Cl and methylamine) the amount of intracellular type VI collagen increased significantly (5- to 10-fold), suggesting that a rise of pH in the endosomal/lysosomal apparatus causes inhibition of its degradation. By using a variety of proteinase inhibitors, it was found that inhibition of collagenase (when used in combination with NH4Cl), or inhibition of cysteine proteinases (both with and without NH4Cl), resulted in an increased amount of intracellular type VI collagen, whereas inhibition of serine proteinases significantly lowered the level of intracellular type VI collagen. The data presented are the first to indicate a pathway by which type VI collagen degradation may occur: fibroblasts phagocytose type VI collagen and subsequently digest this collagen in their lysosomal apparatus. Degradation depends on the activity of several enzymes, among them collagenase and serine proteinases, probably exerting their activity in the extracellular space just before the actual internalization. After uptake, digestion involves pH-sensitive lysosomal enzymes, including those belonging to the class of cysteine proteinases.},

Mitochondrial morphology of RGC5 cells was analyzed following staining of the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c and photoactivatable GFP (PAGFP) diffusion assay. Induction of apoptotic cell death in these cells was determined by analyzing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol and flow cytometry. Exposure of RGC5 cells to oxidative stress conditions as well as to elevated pressure resulted in the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network in control cells as well as in cells expressing MARCH5. In cells expressing inactive MARCH5(H43W) or inactive Drp(K38A), mitochondrial fragmentation was significantly blocked and mitochondrial morphology was comparable to that of control cells under normal conditions. Exposure of RGC5 cells to elevated pressure or oxidative stress conditions induced apoptotic cell death as assessed by cytochrome c release and DNA staining, while expression of dominant-negative MARCH5(H43W) or Drp1(K38A) did significantly delay cell death. Preventing mitochondrial fragmentation through interference with the mitochondrial fission machinery protects neuronal cells from programmed cell death following exposure to stressors physiologically relevant to the pathogenesis of glaucoma.},

The structures of wild type and the F231L mutant are very similar. The F231L mutation results in only a small disturbance of the ERCC1-XPF interface, where, in contrast to Phe(231), Leu(231) lacks interactions stabilizing the ERCC1-XPF complex. One of the two anchor points is severely distorted, and this results in a more dynamic complex, causing reduced stability and an increased dissociation rate of the mutant complex as compared with wild type.

The use of porcine ocular cells as putative xenotransplants appears theoretically possible. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of various porcine ocular cells in vitro to human cytokines in regard to the activation of JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Porcine lens epithelial cells, pigmented iris epithelial cells and pigmented ciliary body cells were used in this study. These cells were isolated from freshly enucleated porcine eyes by enzymatic digestion. Cultured cells between passages 3-8 were used in all experiments. Electromobility shift assay (EMSA), proliferation assay, immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry were used to evaluate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in these cells. JAK/STAT signaling pathways could be activated in porcine pigmented epithelial ciliary body cells, in pigmented iris epithelial cells and in lens epithelial cells in response to porcine and human interferons and cytokines. All cells showed very strong STAT1 activation upon stimulation with porcine interferon-gamma. Porcine ocular cells also respond to human cytokines; IFN-alpha induced strong activation of STAT1 in EMSA, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence experiments whereas activation of STAT3 was less strong in EMSA, but strong in flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Human recombinant IL-6 activated STAT3 and human IL-4 activated STAT6. With the help of immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry we observed nuclear localization of STAT proteins after activation of porcine ocular cells with cytokines and interferons. Human IFN-α had an inhibitory effect on porcine ocular cells in proliferation assays. Our study demonstrated that some types of human cytokines and interferon activate intracellular JAK-STAT signaling pathways in porcine ocular cells. We hypothesize that direct stimulation of the JAK-STAT pathway in porcine cells in response to human cytokines will lead to complications or failure, if pig-to-human ocular tissue xenotransplantation were to be carried out. For successful xenotransplantation among other obstacles there must be new approaches developed to regulate signaling pathways.},

We have analyzed the chromosomes of the ARPE-19 cell line and found cultured cells exist as a heterogeneous mixture having both normal karyotypes and chromosomal rearrangements. In ARPE-19 cells, we observed metaphases with a single translocation t(15;19) and metaphases with two translocations t(5;15) and t(15;19) and a derivative chromosome 9. Aneuploidies have also been detected (monosomy: -16; trisomy: +11, +18). Multiple attempts to isolate clones with a normal karyotype from those with aberrant karyotypes failed due to senescence of cells of normal karyotypes. We could, however, isolate clones with the translocation t(15;19) and clones with two translocations t(5;15) and t(15;19). In continued cell culture after second subcloning for 30 passages, all clones maintained their cytogenetic integrity.We have further investigated the chromosomal profiles of the ARPE-19 cell line from another laboratory and observed cells with a normal karyotype as well as abnormalities in chromosomes 6p and 11q. The DNA profiles of the ARPE-19 cells from both labs were identical to the ATCC profiles, excluding contamination with other cell lines. Since chromosomal translocations in ARPE-19 cells differ from lab to lab and display a mosaicism for structural chromosomal aberrations, researchers dealing with ARPE-19 cells should screen their stocks for chromosomal aberrations and proceed with caution against misinterpretations during experimental manipulations with this cell line. This chapter describes in detail our laboratory methods for single cell cloning, karyotype analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), which we used for the identification and characterization of chromosomal translocations in the retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19.},

Structure determination of µ-CnIIIC revealed some similarities to α-conotoxins acting on nAChRs. µ-CnIIIC potently blocked VGSCs in skeletal muscle and nerve, and hence is applicable to myorelaxation.

Four themes emerged from the interviews: running the relay race of child protection; reporters as runners with expectations of runners' characteristics and the order of runners; carrying the baton of a mandatory report described using baton characteristics while running in space and time; and team chemistry including trust of and communication with teammates. Systems that encourage and promote team building and collaboration among child abuse reporters are needed.

In addition, several articles were excluded based on title alone. A total of 1312 articles were identified and reviewed manually for inclusion criteria. Review of the articles found 25 original articles for consideration. Several toys were found to be associated with contact dermatitis. These included electronics, toy cars, costume jewelry, bicycles, sqwish balls, slime, Play-Doh, and plasticine. Electronics such as video game controllers, cellphones, iPads, and computers were implicated.

The latter was used to characterize water molecules known to play an important role in mediating interactions. Besides the anticipated Kac binding site, we consistently found the bromodomain BC loop as hotspots for the interaction. This information was used to create a data-driven model for the complex using HADDOCK.

  abstract = {Novel reduced sugar gemini amphiphiles linked through their tertiary amino head groups via alkyl spacers of 4 or 6 carbons, and with varying (unsaturated) alkyl tail lengths of 12--18, have been synthesized and tested for transfection in vitro in an adherent Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1). Transfection efficiencies peaked at 2.7 times that of the commercial standard Lipofectamine Plus/2000 for pure solutions of the compound bearing unsaturated (oleyl) alkyl tails. For those compounds bearing saturated alkyl tails, transfection efficiency peaked at a tail length of 16, at a level similar to Lipofectamine Plus/2000. All of the amphiphiles formed bilayer vesicles at physiological pH. Some of the amino groups at the surface were protonated, and vesicles therefore bore a positive charge. Increased protonation with reduced pH resulted in greatly increased monomer solubility and a morphology change from vesicle to micelle at characteristic pH values, dependent on the tail length. For the compounds promoting high transfection efficiency, this characteristic pH was within the range found in the endosomal compartment (7.4--4.0). Formation of mixed micelles between gemini surfactant and membrane phospholipids at reduced pH may therefore provide a method of endosome rupture and subsequent escape of entrapped DNA, thus discarding the need for extra fusogenic or endosomolytic agents. The positive charge on the vesicles at physiological pH drives the colloidal association with DNA. Small angle X-ray scattering measurements indicate that lamellar aggregates are formed, which have a d spacing of 48--54 A. Preliminary differential scanning calorimetric measurements suggest that reduction of pH causes a disordering of the hydrocarbon region of the DNA-surfactant complex.},

Using family-based whole-exome sequencing, we identified truncating mutations in the centrosome gene CENPF in the two nonconsanguineous Caucasian sibling pairs. Compound heterozygous inheritance was confirmed in both families. Recently, mutations in this gene were shown to cause a fetal lethal phenotype, the phenotype and functional data being compatible with a human ciliopathy [Waters et al., 2015]. We show for the first time that Strømme syndrome is an autosomal-recessive disease caused by mutations in CENPF that can result in a wide phenotypic spectrum.},

  abstract = {Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is associated with a substantial rate of adverse events. We sought to design a machine learning (ML)-based model to predict the risk of in-hospital death and to perform a clustering of TTS patients to identify different risk profiles. A ridge logistic regression-based ML model for predicting in-hospital death was developed on 3482 TTS patients from the International Takotsubo (InterTAK) Registry, randomly split in a train and an internal validation cohort (75% and 25% of the sample size, respectively) and evaluated in an external validation cohort (1037 patients). Thirty-one clinically relevant variables were included in the prediction model. Model performance represented the primary endpoint and was assessed according to area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. As secondary endpoint, a K-medoids clustering algorithm was designed to stratify patients into phenotypic groups based on the 10 most relevant features emerging from the main model. The overall incidence of in-hospital death was 5.2%. The InterTAK-ML model showed an AUC of 0.89 (0.85-0.92), a sensitivity of 0.85 (0.78-0.95) and a specificity of 0.76 (0.74-0.79) in the internal validation cohort and an AUC of 0.82 (0.73-0.91), a sensitivity of 0.74 (0.61-0.87) and a specificity of 0.79 (0.77-0.81) in the external cohort for in-hospital death prediction. By exploiting the 10 variables showing the highest feature importance, TTS patients were clustered into six groups associated with different risks of in-hospital death (28.8% vs. 15.5% vs. 5.4% vs. 1.0.8% vs. 0.5%) which were consistent also in the external cohort. A ML-based approach for the identification of TTS patients at risk of adverse short-term prognosis is feasible and effective. The InterTAK-ML model showed unprecedented discriminative capability for the prediction of in-hospital death.},

However, the ability of stem cells to mitigate catastrophic damage, such as that sustained after major myocardial infarction is inadequate to rebuild the heart and restore functional capacity. However, capitalizing on the ability of these cells to attenuate damage in the myocardium, various maneuvers that enhance repair mechanisms to improve cardiac structure and function after injury are being investigated. These studies have led to discovery of various factors that mediate cardioprotection and enhance endogenous repair by 1) salvaging surviving myocardium, 2) promoting homing of stem cells and 3) increasing survival and proliferation of stem cell populations at the site of injury. Herein we report upon a downstream target of Akt kinase, named Pim-1, which promotes cardioprotective signaling and enhances cardiac structure and function after pathological injury. The compilation of studies presented here supports use of Pim-1 to enhance long-term myocardial repair after pathological damage.

  abstract = {Jellyfish collagen, which can be defined as "collagen type 0" due to its homogeneity to the mammalian types I, II, III, V, and IX and its batch-to-batch consistent producibility, is of special interest for different medical applications related to (bone) tissue regeneration as an alternative to mammalian collagen-based biomaterials. However, no in vivo studies regarding the induction of M1- and M2-macrophages and their time-dependent ration as well as the analysis of the bone regeneration capacity of jellyfish collagen scaffolds have been conducted until now. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the nature of the immune response to jellyfish collagen scaffolds and their bone healing capacities. Two in vivo studies using established implantation models, i.e., the subcutaneous and the calvarian implantation model in Wistar rats, were conducted. Furthermore, specialized histological, histopathological, and histomorphometrical methods have been used. As a control biomaterial, a collagen scaffold, originating from porcine pericardium, which has already been stated as biocompatible, was used for the subcutaneous study. The results of the present study show that jellyfish collagen scaffolds are nearly completely resorbed until day 60 post implantation by stepwise integration within the subcutaneous connective tissue mediated mainly by macrophages and single multinucleated giant cells. Interestingly, the degradation process ended in a vessel rich connective tissue that is understood to be an optimal basis for tissue regeneration. The study results showed an overall weaker immune response to jellyfish collagen than to porcine pericardium matrices by the induction of significantly lower numbers of macrophages together with a more balanced occurrence of M1- and M2-macrophages. However, both collagen-based biomaterials induced balanced numbers of both macrophage subtypes, which supports their good biocompatibility. Moreover, the histomorphometrical results for the calvarial implantation of the jellyfish scaffolds revealed an average of 46.20% de novo bone formation at day 60, which was significantly higher compared to the control group. Thereby, the jellyfish collagen scaffolds induced also significantly higher numbers of anti-inflammatory macrophages within the bony implantation beds. Altogether, the results show that the jellyfish collagen scaffolds allowed for a directed integration behavior, which is assumed to be in accordance with the concept of Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR). Furthermore, the jellyfish collagen scaffolds induced a long-term anti-inflammatory macrophage response and an optimal vascularization pattern within their implant beds, thus showing excellent biocompatibility and (bone) tissue healing properties.},

Following plasma miR-sequencing (seq) in a transwomen discovery (n = 20) and validation cohort (n = 30), we identified miR-224 and miR-452. Subsequent systemic silencing of these miRs in male C57Bl/6 J mice (n = 10) was followed by RNA-seq-based gene expression analysis of brown and white adipose tissue in conjunction with mechanistic studies in cultured adipocytes. Estradiol in transwomen lowered plasma miR-224 and -452 carried in extracellular vesicles (EVs) while their systemic silencing in mice and cultured adipocytes increased lipogenesis (white adipose) but reduced glucose uptake and mitochondrial respiration (brown adipose). In white and brown adipose tissue, differentially expressed (miR target) genes are associated with lipogenesis (white adipose) and mitochondrial respiration and glucose uptake (brown adipose). This study identified an estradiol-drive post-transcriptional network that could potentially offer a mechanistic understanding of metabolism following gender-affirming estradiol therapy.},

The mean age was 64 years (range, 17-95 years), 147 patients (56%) were male, 80 patients (30%) had stage I/II, 126 patients (48%) stage III/IV, and 57 patients (22%) had primary extranodal disease.

The use of RT was significantly different: 17 patients (23%) received RT at SUS and 92 patients (65%) at HUS (P < .001). For 219 patients with International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of 0 to 3, 5-year cancer-specific survival (CSS) was 67% at SUS and 81% at HUS (P = .012). For 73 patients with complete response after chemotherapy there were no differences in survival between patients with and without RT. For 138 patients with any residual mass after chemotherapy, there were highly significant differences in favor of receiving RT (n = 81) versus no RT (n = 57): 5-year CSS 89% versus 69% (P < .001), and 5-year overall survival 82% versus 59% (P = .005). The effect of RT on residual mass was evident in most subgroups, mainly in low to intermediate risk, but not in high-risk (IPI 4-5) patients.

Relevant demographic, social, medical history and current medications were collected. The study included 1144 patients, 972 (85%) females, with a mean (SD) age of 59 (14.1) years. In unmatched patients, the UWS flow rate was lower in patients taking a medication (vs. not taking a medication) from the following drug categories: opioid analgesics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antihypertensives, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, diuretics, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and hormones. There was a greater negative effect on SWS flow rate in patients taking (vs. not taking) anticonvulsants, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, and DMARDs. In matched patients, both UWS (0.22 vs. 0.19 ml/min; p = 0.03) and SWS (0.97 vs. 0.85 ml/min; p = .017) flow rates were higher in patients on non-opioid analgesics (vs. not taking).

Finally, differences in medians of both UWS and SWS were statistically significant in patients taking 1 or more than 1 opioid analgesic (vs. not taking, p ≤ .0001 and p = .031, respectively), 1 or more than 1 anticonvulsants (vs. not taking, p = .008 and p = .007), 1 or more than 1 antidepressants (vs. not taking, p < .0001 for both), 1 or more than 1 DMARDs (vs. not taking, p = .042, and p = .003). A greater negative impact on UWS and SWS flow rates was seen in patients taking more than one medication from the same drug class. Intake of antidepressants, corticosteroids and DMARDs is associated with lower whole saliva flow rates. Salivary flow rate can be modified by some specific medications, mostly by polypharmacy.},

In a randomized, prospective, double-blind study 30 children (aged 1.5-20 months) received a continuous infusion of either 0.2 (group 0.2) or 0.3 microg/kg/min remifentanil (group 0.3) as part of a balanced anesthesia with 0.6 MAC sevoflurane. Heart rate, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, end tidal CO2 and pulse oxymetry were monitored throughout the procedure. Extubation times were noted, and recovery from anesthesia was evaluated using Aldrete scores. : Haemodynamic response to intubation was well blunted in both groups. No significant changes in hemodynamic variables were noted from induction of anesthesia until 10 min after intubation. From then on there was a decrease in HR and systolic arterial pressure, which remained significant throughout the procedure in both groups. Extubation times were similar in both groups: 7.3 min (2,1) in group 0.2 vs. 6.6 min (2,1) in group 0.3 (NS).

  abstract = {Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is increasingly used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, despite its potential toxicity and the risk of life-threatening rebound pulmonary hypertension upon its discontinuation. We investigated whether i.v. dipyridamole, a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, increased the effects of inhaled NO and prevented rebound pulmonary hypertension. In 14 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated piglets, pulmonary hypertension was induced with U-46619, a thromboxane A(2) analogue. Response to NO and rebound pulmonary hypertension were evaluated without and with i.v. dipyridamole. Low-dose dipyridamole (10 micro g/kg/min) increased cardiac output and augmented the effects of inhaled NO on pulmonary vascular resistance, with marginal additive effect on mean pulmonary artery pressure. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 904 to 511 (20 parts per million NO) (p < 0.0005) and 358 dyne s cm(-5) (20 parts per million NO + dipyridamole) (p < 0.001 versus NO alone), and mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 29.0 to 20.5 (p < 0.0001) and 19.3 mm Hg (NS versus NO), respectively. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 85 to 74 mm Hg (dipyridamole + NO) (p < 0.01). High-dose dipyridamole (100 micro g/kg/min) with inhaled NO reduced pulmonary vascular resistance to 334 dyne s cm(-5) but also decreased mean arterial pressure to 57 mm Hg. Eight piglets developed rebound pulmonary hypertension. Two died of acute right ventricular failure and, in five, rebound pulmonary hypertension was prevented by low-dose dipyridamole. In conclusion, low-dose i.v. dipyridamole augments the effects of inhaled NO on right ventricular afterload with moderate changes in systemic hemodynamics, and can prevent rebound pulmonary hypertension.},

  abstract = {Continuous administration of inhaled nitric oxide is now widely used as a potent and selective pulmonary vasodilator. We have evaluated the effects of IV dipyridamole, a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitor, on the magnitude and duration of action of inhaled nitric oxide (NO)-mediated pulmonary vasodilation. We hypothesized that inhibition of cGMP degradation could augment and prolong the pulmonary vasodilating effects of NO and allow for intermittent NO inhalation. In eight anesthetized and mechanically ventilated piglets, IV U-46619, a thromboxane A(2) analog, was used to induce pulmonary hypertension. The effects of 2, 5, and 10 ppm of NO, delivered during 4 min for each concentration and followed by a 10-min NO-free interval after each NO concentration, were evaluated without and with dipyridamole. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 825 +/- 49 dynes. s. cm(-5) (U-46619) to 533 +/- 48 dynes. s. cm(-5) (10 ppm NO) (P < 0.05 versus U-46619) and 396 +/- 42 dynes. s. cm(-5) (dipyridamole 10 microg kg-1x min-1 and 10 ppm NO) (P <0.05 versus NO), and cardiac output increased from 1.93 +/- 0.09 L/min to 2.03 +/- 0.13 L/min and 2.60 +/- 0.30 L/min (P < 0.05 versus NO). Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 90 +/- 5 mm Hg (10 ppm NO) to 75 +/- 3 mm Hg (dipyridamole plus 10 ppm NO) (P < 0.01). The pulmonary vasodilation obtained with NO alone could be prolonged from 12 to 42 min when inhaled NO was combined with IV dipyridamole, accounting for a time-weighted reduction in NO exposure by 72%. We conclude that dipyridamole augments the effects of NO on right ventricular afterload, allows for intermittent NO inhalation, and can significantly reduce exposure to NO. IV dipyridamole prolongs the action of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in a piglet model of acute pulmonary hypertension. Intermittent NO inhalation combined with IV dipyridamole decreases pulmonary artery pressure for a prolonged period of time and reduces exposure to NO.},

Dual blockade led to HIF1α upregulation and CalR translocation, accompanied by massive impairment of mitochondrial function. Basal oxygen consumption rate, ATP synthesis, and maximal mitochondrial respiration decreased, confirming disrupted endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial homeostasis. This was paralleled by mitochondrial depolarization and upregulation of the UPR sensors PERK, ATF6α, and IRE1α. Notably, dual EZH2/CDK4/6 blockade also reduced 3D-spheroid invasion, partially inhibited tumor growth in ovo, and led to impaired viability of patient-derived organoids. Mechanistically, this was due to transcriptional changes in genes involved in mitotic aberrations/spindle assembly (Rb, PLK1, RRM2, PRC1, CENPF, TPX2), histone modification (HIST1H1B, HIST1H3G), DNA damage/replication stress events (TOP2A, ATF4), immuno-oncology (DEPDC1), EMT-counterregulation (PCDH1) and a shift in the stemness profile towards a more differentiated state.

Nevertheless, it is frequently prescribed to pediatric patients as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia or for procedural sedation. There is ample literature on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in this vulnerable patient population, but there is a general lack of consensus on dosing. In this project, we aimed to use the standardized workflow of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary to establish best evidence-based pediatric dosing guidelines for dexmedetomidine as premedication and for procedural sedation. The available literature on dexmedetomidine in pediatrics was reviewed in order to address the following three questions: (1) What is the right dose? (2) What is known about efficacy? (3) What is known about safety? Relevant literature was compiled into a risk-benefit analysis document. A team of clinical experts critically appraised the analysis and the proposed dosing recommendations. Dexmedetomidine is most commonly administered via the intravenous or intranasal route. Clearance is age dependent, warranting higher doses in infants to reach similar exposure as in adults. Dexmedetomidine use results in satisfactory sedation at parent separation, adequate sedation and a favorable recovery profile. The safety profile is good and comparable to adults, with dose-related hemodynamic effects. Following the structured approach of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary, best evidence-based dosing recommendations were proposed for dexmedetomidine, used as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia (intranasal dose) and for procedural sedation (intranasal and intravenous dose) in pediatric patients.},

Underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still patchy. We characterized IL-1α action on muscle performance in "skinned" muscle fibers using force transducers and confocal Ca(2+) fluorescence microscopy for force/Ca(2+) transients and Ca(2+) sparks. Association of IL-1α with sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) release channel, ryanodine receptor (RyR) 1, was investigated with coimmunoprecipitation and confocal immunofluorescence colocalization. Membrane integrity was studied in single, intact fibers challenged with IL-1α. IL-1α reversibly stabilized Mg(2+) inhibition of Ca(2+) release. Low Mg(2+)-induced force and Ca(2+) transients were reversibly abolished by IL-1α. At normal Mg(2+), IL-1α reversibly increased caffeine-induced force and Ca(2+) transients. IL-1α reduced SR Ca(2+) leak via RyR1, as judged by (1) increased SR Ca(2+) retention, (2) increased IL-1α force transients being reproduced by 25 μM tetracaine, and (3) reduced Ca(2+) spark frequencies by IL-1α or tetracaine. Coimmunoprecipitation confirmed RyR1/IL-1 association. RyR1/IL-1 immunofluorescence patterns perfectly colocalized. Long-term, 8-hour IL-1α challenge of intact muscle fibers compromised membrane integrity in approximately 50% of fibers, and confirmed intracellular IL-1α deposition. IL-1α exerts a novel, specific, and reversible interaction mechanism with the skeletal muscle RyR1 macromolecular release complex without the need to act via its membrane IL-1 receptor, as IL-1R membrane expression levels were not detectable in Western blots or immunostaining of single fibers. We present a potential explanation of how the inflammatory mediator, IL-1α, may contribute to muscle weakness in critical illness.},

Interestingly, ADHD was recently linked to an elevated risk of PD in epidemiological studies, particularly among individuals treated with psychostimulants. Here, we investigated the potential of SN echogenicity as a disease biomarker in adults with ADHD and its relation to psychostimulant treatment. In an exploratory cross-sectional cohort study, we performed transcranial sonography of the SN in 30 adults (mean age 33.3 ± 7.6 years, 19 males/11 females) diagnosed with ADHD according to DSM-V criteria. In this pilot study, we observed no evidence of structural abnormalities of the SN among adults diagnosed with ADHD, thus questioning the potential of SN+ as a biomarker for ADHD in this population. Moreover, we found no evidence of treatment-related SN echogenicity changes that would link therapeutic psychostimulant use to alterations in the structural integrity of the SN.},

Current gas cells are only capable of temperature measurement on a global (mm) scale, although the local temperature at the spot of observation (µm to nm scale) may significantly differ. Thus, local temperature fluctuations caused by gas flow and heat dissipation dynamics remain undetected when solely relying on the global device feedback. In this study, we overcome this limitation by measuring the specimen temperature in situ utilizing parallel-beam electron diffraction at gold nanoparticles. By combining this technique with an advanced data processing algorithm, we achieve sub-Kelvin precision in both, vacuum as well as gaseous environments. Mitigating charging effects is furthermore shown to minimize systematic errors. By utilizing this method, we characterize the local thermal stability of a state-of-the-art gas cell equipped with heating capability in vacuum and under various gas-flow conditions.

We detected highly cell-type specific transcriptional responses with characteristic time courses and active intercellular communication. Cardiomyocytes after TAC exerted an early and sustained upregulation of inflammatory and matrix genes and a concomitant suppression of metabolic and ion channel genes. Fibroblasts, in contrast, showed transient early upregulation of inflammatory and matrix genes and downregulation of angiogenesis genes, but sustained induction of cell cycle and ion channel genes during TAC. Endothelial cells transiently induced cell cycle and extracellular matrix genes early after TAC, but exerted a long-lasting upregulation of inflammatory genes. As we found that matrix production by multiple cell types triggers pathological cellular responses, it might serve as a future therapeutic target.},

This mapping review design was informed by the Focused Mapping Review and Synthesis (FMRS) approach. Studies were categorized and visualized based on study design, type of musician sampled (i.e., profession, instrument, musical genre), and well-being determinants, using the Ecology of Musical Performance (EMP) Model as a foundational framework. This review found that the majority of well-being studies identified focused on musculoskeletal health. Additionally, few intervention studies were identified, and all involved samples of music students in intervention studies were in K-12 or higher education programs. While the EMP model proposes a holistic approach to understanding musician well-being, many crucial well-being determinants highlighted by the model have not been recently studied within the musician health research. Addressing these gaps will provide a more comprehensive foundation for improving the health and well-being of all musicians.},

  abstract = {Many residents experience their transitions, such as from medical student to resident, as demanding and stressful. The challenges they face are twofold: coping with changes in tasks or responsibilities and performing (new) social roles. This process of 'learning the ropes' is known as Organizational Socialization (OS). Although there is substantial literature on transitions from the perspective of residents, the voices of program directors (PDs) who facilitate and guide residents through the organizational socialization process have not yet been explored. PDs' perspectives are important, since PDs are formally responsible for Postgraduate Medical Education (PGME) and contribute, directly or indirectly, to residents' socialization process. Using the lens of OS, we explored what strategies PDs use to facilitate organizational socialization of newcomer residents. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 PDs of different specialties. We used a theory-informing inductive data analysis study design, comprising an inductive thematic analysis, a deductive interpretation of the results through the lens of OS and, subsequently, an inductive analysis to identify overarching insights. We identified six strategies PDs used to facilitate organizational socialization of newcomer residents and uncovered two overarching insights. First, PDs varied in the extent to which they planned their guidance. Some PDs planned socialization as an explicit learning objective and assigned residents' tasks and responsibilities accordingly, making it an intended program outcome. However, socialization was also facilitated by social interactions in the workplace, making it an unintended program outcome. Second, PDs varied in the extent to which they adapted their strategies to the newcomer residents. Some PDs used individualized strategies tailored to individual residents' needs and skills, particularly in cases of poor performance, by broaching and discussing the issue or adjusting tasks and responsibilities. However, PDs also used workplace strategies requiring residents to adjust to the workplace without much intervention, which was often viewed as an implicit expectation. PDs' used both intentional and unintentional strategies to facilitate socialization in residents, which may imply that socialization can occur irrespective of the PD's strategy. PDs' strategies varied from an individual-centered to a workplace-centered approach to socialization. Further research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of residents' perceptions of PD's efforts to facilitate their socialization process during transitions.},

The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of reverse shoulder arthroplasty between younger and older patients. Patients who underwent primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty between January 2000 and December 2019 were identified from New Zealand Joint Registry records. Patients were stratified into two cohorts according to age at the time of surgery: < 55 years and ≥ 55 years. These two groups were then compared with regard to baseline characteristics, indications for surgery, revision rates, and patient-reported outcomes using the Oxford Shoulder Score and American Shoulder and Elbow Score (ASES). A total of 5518 primary reverse shoulder arthroplasty cases were identified, with 75 patients < 55 years at the time of surgery (range: 34-54 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 2.36 years (range: 0.11-13.37 years) in the younger cohort and 3.10 years (range: 0.01-16.22 years) in the older patient cohort. Indications for surgery differed significantly between the two groups, with younger patients having higher rates of inflammatory arthritis ( Our early results suggest that younger patients undergoing reverse shoulder arthroplasty demonstrate high implant retention rates, comparable to older patients. Longer-term patient-reported outcomes in younger patients are required to guide appropriate patient selection for reverse shoulder arthroplasty. Level III, retrospective case-control study.},

We set out to understand how IAV load impacts cancer growth and modifies cellular and molecular players in the TME. Herein, we report that IAV can infect both tumor and immune cells, resulting in a long-term protumoral effect in tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistically, IAV impaired tumor-specific T-cell responses, led to the exhaustion of memory CD8+ T cells and induced PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. IAV infection modulated the transcriptomic profile of the TME, fine-tuning it toward immunosuppression, carcinogenesis, and lipid and drug metabolism. Consistent with these data, the transcriptional module induced by IAV infection in tumor cells in tumor-bearing mice was also found in human patients with lung adenocarcinoma and correlated with poor overall survival. In conclusion, we found that IAV infection worsened lung tumor progression by reprogramming the TME toward a more aggressive state.},

The role of the aromatic side chains Y21 and W104, which are in close vicinity to the FAD cofactor in the AppA BLUF domain from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, is investigated through the introduction of several amino acid substitutions at these positions. NMR spectroscopy indicated that in the W104F mutant, the local structure of the FAD binding pocket was not significantly perturbed as compared to that of the wild type. Time-resolved fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy was applied to explore the role of Y21 and W104 in AppA BLUF photochemistry. In the Y21 mutants, FADH*-W* radical pairs are transiently formed on a ps time scale and recombine to the ground state on a ns time scale. The W104F mutant shows a spectral evolution similar to that of wild type AppA but with an increased yield of signaling state formation. In the Y21F/W104F double mutant, all light-driven electron-transfer processes are abolished, and the FAD singlet excited-state evolves by intersystem crossing to the triplet state. Our results indicate that two competing light-driven electron-transfer pathways are available in BLUF domains: one productive pathway that involves electron transfer from the tyrosine, which leads to signaling state formation, and one nonproductive electron-transfer pathway from the tryptophan, which leads to deactivation and the effective lowering of the quantum yield of the signaling state formation. Our results are consistent with a photoactivation mechanism for BLUF domains where signaling state formation proceeds via light-driven electron and proton transfer from the conserved tyrosine to FAD, followed by a hydrogen-bond rearrangement and radical-pair recombination.},

We present ClinFly, an open-source pipeline that automatically de-identifies, translates, and summarizes medical reports into HPO terms, in compliance with health-data privacy standards and FAIR principles. In a multicenter, prospective evaluation, we benchmarked ClinFly against physician annotation for de-identification and phenotypic summarization of 50 non-English medical reports. The method achieved a recall of 99% and precision of 77% for protected health information (PHI) de-identification. For HPO summarization, high-confidence predictions reached a recall of 49% and precision of 92%, improving to 78% recall when including low-confidence terms, with an average of 6.6 HPO terms captured per report.

The performances of RF pulses designed based on optimized and non-optimized trajectories were compared. The optimized trajectories were utilized for universal pulse design. The universal pulse performances were compared with subject specific tailored pulse performances. The OTUP workflow (optimization of transmit k-space trajectories and universal pulse calculation) was tested on three test target excitation patterns. For one target (local excitation of a central area in the human brain) the pulses were tested in vivo at 9.4 T. The workflow produced appropriate transmit k-space trajectories for each test target. Utilization of an optimized trajectory was crucial for the pulse performance. Using unsuited trajectories diminished the performance. It was possible to create target specific universal pulses. However, not every test target is equally well suited for universal pulse design. There was no significant difference in the in vivo performance between subject specific tailored pulses and a universal pulse at 9.4 T. The proposed workflow further exploited and improved the universal pulse concept by combining it with gradient trajectory optimization for stack of spirals and SPINS.

Data were analysed using template analysis. Three themes were developed: 1) Value judgements of behaviours; 2) Considerations on differences between children; 3) Problematic interpretations of AQ-Child items. These processes may affect how parents and community members report on children's autistic traits. Cross-cultural comparisons suggested subtle differences in interpretations and judgements, and British participants referred to age expectations and comparisons with other children more than Egyptian/Sudanese participants. However, within-group variability, sometimes attributed to socioeconomic status and generation, appeared larger than cross-cultural differences. Our findings further the insights on influence of culture and within-community factors on reporting children's behaviour relevant to autism.

We previously described the REPETITIVE PETUNIA SEQUENCE (RPS) fragment that acts as a hot spot for de novo methylation, for which it requires the cooperative activity of all three methyltransferases MET1, CMT3 and DRM2, but not the RdDM pathway. RPS contains two identical 11nt elements in inverted orientation, interrupted by a 18nt spacer, which resembles the features of a stemloop structure. The analysis of deletion/substitution derivatives of this region showed that deletion of one 11nt element RPS is sufficient to eliminate de novo methylation of RPS. In addition, deletion of a 10nt region directly adjacent to one of the 11nt elements, significantly reduced de novo methylation. When both 11nt regions were replaced by two 11nt elements with altered DNA sequence but unchanged inverted repeat homology, DNA methylation was not affected, indicating that de novo methylation was not targeted to a specific DNA sequence element. These data suggest that de novo DNA methylation is attracted by a secondary structure to which the two 11nt elements contribute, and that the adjacent 10nt region influences the stability of this structure. This resembles the recognition of structural features by DNA methyltransferases in animals and suggests that similar mechanisms exist in plants.},

The potential application of specific conotoxins as neuropharmalogical agents and chemical probes requires a full characterization of the relevant peptides, including the structure of the carbohydrate part. In this review, the currently existing knowledge of O-glycosylation of conotoxins is described.},

  abstract = {Nissen fundoplication is associated with poor long-term durability, as well as dysphasia and gas bloat. We report here the long-term results of modified Belsey fundoplication (Gastroesophageal Valvuloplasty; GEV) performed laparoscopically using a surgical robot. Patients who underwent robotic GEV were reviewed retrospectively. Operations were performed by laparoscopy and included robotic dissection of the esophageal hiatus, primary closure of the hiatus, followed by intussusception of a 4 cm segment of the esophagus into the stomach for 270°, and suspension of the fundoplication on the hiatal closure. The results were assessed by postoperative endoscopy, contrast esophagography, a Subjective Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ), and objective Visick grading. There were 291 patients (156 male, 135 female, mean age 51±14 years). Indications were intractability (73%) and pulmonary symptoms (27%). Mean operative time was 130 minutes ± 52 minutes. Minor complications were seen in 21%. There was no mortality. Mean hospitalization was 2.8 days ± 1.7 days. Mean follow-up was 85 months ± 7 months. During this period, the mean SSQ score decreased from 8.3 ± 0.6 to 0.7± 0.2 (P < 0.05). There was no long-term dysphasia or gas bloat. Ninety-five percent of patients were Visick I and 5% were Visick II. Hiatal hernia recurred in 7 patients (2%). Robotic laparoscopic modified Belsey fundoplication (GEV) is associated with excellent long-term durability, reflux control, and low rates of dysphasia and gas bloat. This procedure may represent an alternative to medical antireflux therapy and other surgical antireflux procedures such as Nissen fundoplication.},

Only described in female patients, SMC1A epilepsy syndrome is characterized by the onset of severe refractory epileptic seizures in the first year of life, global developmental delay, a variable degree of intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features not typical of CdLS. This was a descriptive observational study for the largest international cohort with this specific disorder. The main goal of this study was to improve the knowledge of the natural history of this phenotype with particular attention to the psychomotor development and the epilepsy data. The analyzed cohort shows normal prenatal growth with the subsequent development of postnatal microcephaly. The incidence of neonatal problems (seizures and respiratory compromise) is considerable (51.4%). There is a significant prevalence of central nervous system (20%) and cardiovascular malformations (20%). Motor skills are generally delayed. The presence of drug-resistant epilepsy is confirmed; the therapeutic role of a ketogenic diet is still uncertain. The significant regression of previously acquired skills following the onset of seizures has been observed. Facial dysmorphisms are variable and no patient shows a classic CdLS phenotype. To sum up, SMC1A variants caused drug-resistant epilepsy in these patients, more than two-thirds of whom were shown to progress to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The SMC1A gene variants are all different from each other (apart from a couple of monozygotic twins), demonstrating the absence of a mutational hotspot in the SMC1A gene. Owing to the absence of phenotypic specificity, whole-exome sequencing is currently the diagnostic gold standard.},

Moreover, cases with an up to 3-year follow-up were chosen to analyze the techniques of mid-term clinical success. Finally, the purification success of the FDBA was analyzed by means of established scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and histological methods. The FBDA bone ring was applied in three different patients and indications and presented; the healing success was analyzed on the basis of radiographical and clinical images. For analysis of the purification of the allogeneic bone, previously established histological methods and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were applied. All analyzed patient cases showed that the FDBA-based bone ring was fully integrated into newly built alveolar bone. Furthermore, the observations revealed that the three-dimensional bone reconstructions in maxilla and mandible were stable within the observational period of up to 3 years. Altogether, the present data show that the application of the Bone Ring Technique using the FDBA rings allows for successful regeneration of alveolar bone with a predictable clinical outcome, functionality and esthetics. Moreover, the material analyses showed that the allogeneic bone tissue was free of cells or cell remnants, while the (ultra-) structure of the bone matrix has been retained. Thus, the biological safety of the FDBA has been confirmed.},

Apples with significantly decreased levels of Mal d 1 would allow most patients in these areas to eat apples without allergic reactions. The aim of this study was to inhibit the expression of Mal d 1 in apple plants by RNA interference. In vitro -grown apple plantlets were transformed with a construct coding for an intron-spliced hairpin RNA containing a Mal d 1-specific inverted repeat sequence separated by a Mal d 1-specific intron sequence. The presence of the construct in transformants was checked by PCR. Expression of Mal d 1 in leaves was monitored by prick-to-prick skin testing in 3 patients allergic to apples and by immunoblotting with a Mal d 1-reactive mAb and with IgE antibodies against Mal d 1. After transformation, plantlets were selected on the basis of having a normal phenotype and growth rate. With PCR, in 6 of 9 selected plantlets, the presence of the gene-silencing construct was demonstrated. By skin prick test it was shown that a wild-type plantlet had significantly ( P < .05) higher allergenicity than 5 of the transformants. Reduction of expression of Mal d 1 was confirmed by immunoblotting. In wild-type and unsuccessful transformants, a strong band was detected with Mal d 1-reactive mAb 5H8 at the expected apparent M r of 17 kDa. This band was virtually absent in the transformants that carried the gene-silencing construct. With human IgE antibodies, the same observations were made. Mal d 1 expression was successfully reduced by RNA interference. This translated into significantly reduced in vivo allergenicity. These observations support the feasibility of the production by gene silencing of apples hypoallergenic for Mal d 1.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Effective screening and early detection are critical in reducing mortality. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been proved useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules and early diagnosis of lung cancer. However, the implementation of lung cancer screening and frequent detection of incidental pulmonary nodules lead to more computed tomography scans resulting in increased costs. Therefore, determining the cost-effectiveness of AI is important for implementing these methods in routine clinical practice. Based on volume measurements of pulmonary nodules performed by AI, patients could potentially be discharged earlier from incidental lung nodule follow-up. To determine whether using AI volume measurements of pulmonary nodules on CT scan results in shorter follow-up time of incidental lung nodule follow-up. For this retrospective cohort study patients with follow-up chest computed tomography for incidental pulmonary nodules were included. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients that could have been discharged earlier from follow-up based on the current BTS guidelines using AI volume measurements. A total of 252 patients were included, of which 49 (19,4 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 14.7-24.9) patients could have been earlier discharged from follow-up using AI volume measurements. Based on current BTS guidelines using AI volume measurements of pulmonary nodules leads to shorter follow-up time period for incidental lung nodule follow-up and therefore a reduction of unnecessary computed tomography imaging, appointments and cost reduction.},

  abstract = {The differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is tightly controlled to ensure a proper balance between myeloid and lymphoid cell output. GATA2 is a pivotal hematopoietic transcription factor required for generation and maintenance of HSCs. GATA2 is expressed throughout development, but because of early embryonic lethality in mice, its role during adult hematopoiesis is incompletely understood. Zebrafish contains 2 orthologs of GATA2: Gata2a and Gata2b, which are expressed in different cell types. We show that the mammalian functions of GATA2 are split between these orthologs. Gata2b-deficient zebrafish have a reduction in embryonic definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) numbers, but are viable. This allows us to uniquely study the role of GATA2 in adult hematopoiesis. gata2b mutants have impaired myeloid lineage differentiation. Interestingly, this defect arises not in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, but in HSPCs. Gata2b-deficient HSPCs showed impaired progression of the myeloid transcriptional program, concomitant with increased coexpression of lymphoid genes. This resulted in a decrease in myeloid-programmed progenitors and a relative increase in lymphoid-programmed progenitors. This shift in the lineage output could function as an escape mechanism to avoid a block in lineage differentiation. Our study helps to deconstruct the functions of GATA2 during hematopoiesis and shows that lineage differentiation flows toward a lymphoid lineage in the absence of Gata2b.},

  abstract = {MOG antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) is a new entity within the spectrum of autoimmune inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. It is distinct from multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Although they share certain clinical characteristics, these 3 diseases differ in terms of their pathophysiology, disease course and response to treatment. MOGAD is a rare disease affecting both adults and children, with a higher frequency in the latter. The clinical presentation of MOGAD varies depending on age: in children under the age of 10, presentations of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) are frequently described, whereas in children over the age of 10 and in adults, unilateral or bilateral optic neuritis or acute myelitis is more often observed. Other, rarer presentations have also been reported, including encephalitic presentations with seizures. Radiologic findings can sometimes help guide the diagnosis: extensive anterior optic nerve involvement, perineuritis, extensive lesions of the spinal cord with involvement of the conus medullaris, and involvement of the pons, for example. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring anti-MOG antibodies in the serum. In case of diagnostic doubt, the result must be confirmed in a reference laboratory (currently available in Lyon and Le Kremlin Bicêtre in France). The disease course is usually monophasic in children, but relapses are possible. In adults, the frequency of relapses seems higher than in children, estimated at more than 40% after 5 years. Visual, bladder/sphincter, cognitive and, to a lesser extent, motor sequelae may occur, but much less frequently than in NMOSD. In children and adults, attacks are treated with high-dose IV corticosteroids, which are often very effective, followed by an oral taper. In certain situations, long-term immunoactive therapy may be proposed, particularly when a relapse occurs, after discussion with a reference or expert center for Inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system. Long-term follow-up is proposed at the reference/expert center at least once a year. In between these appointments, follow-up with the referring pediatric neurologist, pediatrician, treating physician or referring neurologist is carried out every 6 months. It is important to check for the occurrence of a new attack and the onset of complications but also, in the case of long-term therapy, adherence to and tolerance of the treatment. Multidisciplinary management is essential and involves a variety of healthcare professionals (neurologist or pediatric neurologist, ophthalmologist, physiatrist, physiotherapist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, psychologist and social worker).},

Plant genomes often encode a number of related terpene synthases, which can produce very different terpenes. The relationship between TPS sequence and resulting terpene product is not completely understood. In this work we describe two TPSs from the Camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. One of these, CiCaMS, acts as a monoterpene synthase (monoTPS), and mediates the production of myrcene, while the other, CiCaSSy, acts as a sesquiterpene synthase (sesquiTPS), and catalyses the production of α-santalene, β-santalene and trans-α-bergamotene. Interestingly, these enzymes share 97% DNA sequence identity and differ only in 22 amino acid residues out of 553. To understand which residues are essential for the catalysis of monoterpenes resp. sesquiterpenes, a number of hybrid synthases were prepared, and supplemented by a set of single-residue variants. These were tested for their ability to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes by in vivo production of sesquiterpenes in E. coli, and by in vitro enzyme assays. This analysis pinpointed three residues in the sequence which could mediate the change in product specificity from a monoterpene synthase to a sesquiterpene synthase. Another set of three residues defined the sesquiterpene product profile, including the ratios between sesquiterpene products.},

Several methods for assigning patches of different structure and size to forest development stages or phases do exist. All currently existing classification methods have in common that a priori assumptions about the characteristics of certain stand structural attributes such as deadwood amount are made. We tested the hypothesis that multivariate datasets of primeval beech forest stand structure possess an inherent, aggregated configuration of data points with individual clusters representing forest development stages. From two completely mapped primeval beech forests in Albania, seven ecologically important stand structural attributes characterizing stand density, regeneration, stem diameter variation and amount of deadwood are derived at 8216 and 9666 virtual sampling points (moving window, focal filtering). K-means clustering is used to detect clusters in the datasets (number of clusters (k) between 2 and 5). The quality of the single clustering solutions is analyzed with average silhouette width as a measure for clustering quality. In a sensitivity analysis, clustering is done with datasets of four different spatial scales of observation (200, 500, 1000 and 1500 m The clustering solutions succeeded in detecting and mapping areas with homogeneous stand structure. The areas had extensions of more than 200 m Our results imply that forest development takes place on a continuous scale and that discrimination between development stages in primeval beech forests is splitting continuous datasets at selected thresholds. For the analysis of the forest development cycle, direct quantification of relevant structural features or processes might be more appropriate than classification. If, however, the study design demands classification, our results can justify the application of conventional forest development stage classification schemes rather than clustering.},

  abstract = {Brain and breathing activities are closely related. However, the exact neurophysiological mechanisms that couple the brain and breathing to stimuli in the external environment are not yet agreed upon. Our data support that synchronization and dynamic attunement are two key mechanisms that couple local brain activity and breathing to external periodic stimuli. First, we review the existing literature, which provides strong evidence for the synchronization of brain and breathing in terms of coherence, cross-frequency coupling and phase-based entrainment. Second, using EEG and breathing data, we show that both the lungs and localized brain activity at the Cz channel attune the temporal structure of their power spectra to the periodic structure of external auditory inputs. We highlight the role of dynamic attunement in playing a key role in coordinating the tripartite temporal alignment of localized brain activity, breathing and input dynamics across longer timescales like minutes. Overall, this perspective sheds light on potential mechanisms of brain-breathing coupling and its alignment to stimuli in the external environment.},

  abstract = {Walking capacity measured by a treadmill test (TT) reflects the patient's maximal capacity in a controlled setting and is part of the physical exercise capacity (PEC). Daily physical activity (PA) is defined as the total of actively freely produced movements per day. A lower PA level has been increasingly recognized as a strong predictor of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with intermittent claudication (IC). Recent insights suggested that an increased PEC does not automatically lead to an increase in daily PA. However, the precise relation between PEC and PA in patients with IC is still unclear. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the association between several PEC outcomes and PA in a general IC population. PEC was determined by well-established tests (Gardner-Skinner TT, a physical performance battery, a timed up-and-go test, and a 6-minute walk test distance). PA was obtained during 7 consecutive days using a triaxial accelerometer (Dynaport MoveMonitor; McRoberts BV, The Hague, The Netherlands). Five PA components (lying, sitting, standing, shuffling, and locomotion) and four parameters (total duration, number of periods, mean duration per period, and mean movement intensity per period) were analysed. Correlation coefficients between PEC and PA components were calculated. Data of 46 patients were available for analysis. Patients were sedentary (sitting and lying) during 81% of the day and were physically active (standing, shuffling, and locomotion) for the remaining 19% of the time. Correlations between PEC outcomes and PA ranged from very weak (0.025) to moderate (0.663). Moderate correlations (as therefore assumed to be relevant) were only found for outcomes of both the TT and 6-minute walk test and the locomotion components of PA. For instance, functional claudication distance (measured by TT) and number of steps per day correlated reasonably well (Spearman correlation ρ = 0.663; P < .01). Exercise capacity and PA correlate minimally in patients with IC. PA may be preferred as a novel outcome measure and future treatment target in patients with IC.},

We propose a template-based digital intervention design mechanism enabling the configuration of evidence-based, just-in-time, adaptive intervention components. The design mechanism incorporates a rule definition language enabling experts to specify triggering conditions for interventions based on momentary and historical contextual/personal data. The framework continuously monitors and processes personal data space and evaluates intervention-triggering conditions. We benefit from reinforcement learning methods to develop personalized intervention delivery strategies with respect to timing, frequency, and type (content) of interventions. To validate the personalization algorithm, we lay out a simulation testbed with 2 personas, differing in their various simulated real-life conditions. We evaluate the design mechanism by presenting example intervention definitions based on behavior change taxonomies and clinical guidelines. Furthermore, we provide intervention definitions for a real-world care program targeting diabetes patients. Finally, we validate the personalized delivery mechanism through a set of hypotheses, asserting certain ways of adaptation in the delivery strategy, according to the differences in simulation related to personal preferences, traits, and lifestyle patterns. While the design mechanism is sufficiently expandable to meet the theoretical and clinical intervention design requirements, the personalization algorithm is capable of adapting intervention delivery strategies for simulated real-life conditions.},

Therefore, we implemented MINFLUX optical nanoscopy to resolve the AZ of rod photoreceptors. This was facilitated by a novel sample immobilization technique that we name heat-assisted rapid dehydration (HARD), wherein a thin layer of rod synaptic terminals (spherules) was transferred onto glass coverslips from fresh retinal slices. Rod ribbon AZs were readily immunolabeled and imaged in 3D with a precision of a few nanometers.

To develop this protocol with optimized acquisition and processing parameters, we initially aggregated 65 functional imaging datasets acquired from rats across 46 centers. We developed a reproducible pipeline for analyzing rat data acquired with diverse protocols and determined experimental and processing parameters associated with the robust detection of functional connectivity across centers. We show that the standardized protocol enhances biologically plausible functional connectivity patterns relative to previous acquisitions.

After the surgical procedure, eyes were fixed, dissected into quartered segments and examined using light and scanning electron microscopy. Tissue sections displayed a marked dilation of SC and of the collector channels compared with untreated control sections. The SC walls were disrupted in some areas due to viscodilation, but not due to SCE implantation. In all eyes, the entire 9-mm length of the SCE was positioned inside the canal, keeping the canal wide open. The SCE diameter of 240 μm remained unchanged after implantation. Injection of a viscoelastic substance into SC leads to marked dilation of SC and collector channels. Implanting the SCE into SC allowed persistent expansion of SC and stretching of the trabecular meshwork. This may increase the permeability of the trabecular meshwork, reduce its resistance to aqueous humour and maintain circumferential flow within SC. Experimental and clinical studies should determine the impact of this new canal expander in terms of lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma surgery.},

  abstract = {Many patients experience nausea and vomiting after surgery, which can be very uncomfortable and may delay recovery. Despite preventive medications, this problem remains common, particularly in women, non-smokers and those with a previous history of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Our research aimed to improve PONV prevention for a quicker, and more comfortable recovery.
  We identified groups more likely to experience PONV, focusing on clinical factors, ethnicity and genetics. Notably, a specific gene (the C allele of P2RX7) may protect against vomiting. We also confirmed that individuals with a prior PONV or motion sickness are at a higher risk of experiencing it again. These insights could guide more personalised PONV prevention strategies in the future.
  Our study also evaluated medicines like olanzapine, aprepitant, and fosaprepitant. Combining certain drugs significantly reduced PONV, while others were less effective. Olanzapine, typically used for mental health conditions, worked well alongside standard treatments, significantly lowering the chances of PONV. However, aprepitant, a drug specifically approved to prevent PONV, did not show much benefit when combined with another drug called palonosetron. After reviewing available studies, we concluded that while these medications help prevent PONV, their effectiveness depends on how they are combined.
  Overall, our findings suggest that we can enhance the prevention of these unpleasant side effects by understanding patient’s individual risk factors and using a combination of medications targeting different factors contributing to PONV. These insights can help improve patient care by making recovery from surgery more comfortable and reducing the risk for complications.},

  abstract = {Postoperative nausea or vomiting occurs in up to 40% in patients with multiple risk factors, despite prophylaxis. Olanzapine is an antipsychotic drug that is used to prevent nausea and vomiting in palliative care and to treat chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. This study aimed to examine whether pre-operative olanzapine, as a prophylactic anti-emetic added to intra-operative dexamethasone, ondansetron and total intravenous anaesthesia, reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting. We performed a multiply-blinded randomised controlled trial in patients aged 18-60 years with cancer at high risk of postoperative nausea or vomiting (three or four risk factors according to the Apfel criteria) plus a previous history of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Patients were allocated at random to receive 10 mg olanzapine or placebo orally 1 h before surgery in addition to a two-drug regimen (dexamethasone and ondansetron) and propofol anaesthesia to prevent postoperative nausea or vomiting. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting in the first 24 h after surgery. In total, 100 patients were enrolled; 47 in the olanzapine group and 49 in the control group completed the study. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. The incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting in the first 24 h after surgery was lower in the olanzapine group (12/47, 26%) than in the control group (31/49, 63%) (p = 0.008, RR 0.40 (95%CI 0.21-0.79)). Adding pre-operative oral olanzapine to intra-operative dexamethasone and ondansetron was highly effective in reducing the risk of postoperative nausea or vomiting in the first 24 hours after surgery in patients with a previous history of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and at least three Apfel risk factors for postoperative nausea or vomiting.},

A systematic search was done on electronic bibliographic databases in July 2023. Randomized controlled trials of olanzapine as a prophylactic antiemetic for PONV in adults who underwent general anesthesia were included. The authors excluded non-RCTs and retracted studies.

The risk of bias was assessed according to the tool suggested by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Meta-analysis included 446 adult patients. Olanzapine reduced on average 38 % the incidence of PONV. The estimated risk ratio (95 % CI) of olanzapine versus control was 0.62 (0.42-0.90), p = 0.010, I This systematic review with meta-analysis indicated that olanzapine as a prophylactic antiemetic alone or combined with other antiemetic agents reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, this conclusion must be presented with some degree of uncertainty due to the small number of studies included. There was a lack of any evidence to draw conclusions on side effects.},

  abstract = {During haemodialysis (HD), polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and platelets are activated and release various granule products, including myeloperoxidase (MPO) and platelet factor 4 (PF4). MPO triggers the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to irreversible protein, carbohydrate and lipid modification. PF4 probably also contributes to oxidative stress. As previously shown, HD-induced PMN degranulation is almost completely abolished during citrate anticoagulation, most probably due to its calcium chelation ability. In the present study, apart from HD-induced PMN and platelet degranulation, oxidative stress was analysed during three modes of anticoagulation. Heparin, dalteparin and citrate (HDhep, HDdal and HDcit) were compared in a randomized, crossover fashion in eight chronic HD patients. Multiple blood samples were taken during the third HD session of each modality, from both the afferent and efferent line. Besides the degranulation markers MPO and PF4, various markers of oxidative stress were measured, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), malondialdehyde (MDA) and carboxymethyllysine (CML). During HDhep and HDdal, marked degranulation was observed shortly after the start of HD. In contrast, during HDcit, PF4 and MPO levels remained unaltered, suggesting no release at all. After 1 week of HDcit, ox-LDL levels were markedly reduced [median 26% (3-65%), P=0.01], if compared with HDhep and HDdal. As regards MDA and CML, no differences were found. This study shows first, that HD-induced PMN and platelet degranulation are early, most probably calcium-dependent processes and, secondly, that the formation of ox-LDL is clearly dependent on the type of anticoagulant applied.},

  abstract = {The etiology of intradialytic hemodynamic instability is multifactorial. Of the various factors involved, a rise in core temperature seems to be crucial. In this respect, the bioincompatibility of hemodialysis (HD) treatment might play an important role. The application of cool dialysate reduces the number of periods of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) considerably. In rats, roller pump perfusion caused hypotension by shear stress induced platelet aggregation and subsequent serotonin release. During clinical HD, citrate anticoagulation abolished platelet activation almost completely. Hence, citrate anticoagulation might reduce IDH, whereas the beneficial effect of cool dialysate might be partly explained by reduced platelet activation. In the present study, blood pressure, IDH episodes, platelet activation, platelet aggregation, and serotonin release were studied crossover in 10 patients during HD with dalteparin anticoagulation at normal and low dialysate temperatures and during HD with citrate. Citrate strongly reduced platelet activation, but did not improve IDH. The blood pressure was best preserved during cool-temperature HD, despite manifest platelet activation. Platelet activation was not accompanied by a rise in the plasma serotonin concentration. Three major conclusions can be drawn: (1) it is unlikely that platelet activation and subsequent serotonin release underlie IDH in the clinical situation; (2) the protective effects of cool dialysate on IDH appear to be independent of HD-induced platelet activation, and (3) extrapolating results from rat experiments to the human situation requires uppermost prudence.},

  abstract = {The sum of undesirable side effects, occurring during haemodialysis (HD), is called bio-incompatibility. Concerning platelets, both an increase in the expression of the cell surface marker P-selectin (CD62p) and release of the intracellular granule product platelet factor 4 (PF4) have been described. However, as PF4 is also abundantly present on endothelium-bound proteoglycans, it is questionable whether the HD-induced increase is exclusively attributable to release from platelets. With respect to the cause of HD-induced bio-incompatibility, interest has been focused mainly on the extracorporeal circuit (ECC), especially the dialyser, whereas only little attention has been paid to other parts of the ECC and the mode of anticoagulation applied. To address the cause and origin of platelet activation and PF4 release during clinical HD, two complementary clinical studies were performed. In study I, the relative influence of the various parts of the ECC was evaluated by measuring the expression of CD62p, platelet aggregation and levels of PF4 and serotonin at various sampling points. In study II, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was administered 10 min before the actual start of HD, in order to separate the effects from LMWH and the ECC on platelet activation. In study I, CD62p expression increased across the entire length of the ECC, including the roller pump and dialyser (median at t(5) from 26% to 43%, P = 0.008; median at t(30) from 28% to 48%, P = 0.007). Increments in PF4 and aggregation of platelets were relatively modest. Platelet serotonin content, which was below reference values in healthy controls, and plasma serotonin concentration, which was above reference values, did not change. In study II, PF4 levels increased markedly after the injection of LMWH (from 12 IU/ml at t(-10) to 75 IU/ml at t(0), P = 0.018), whereas CD62p expression remained stable until the start of HD. Platelet activation, as measured by the up-regulation of CD62p, is an early process, occurring not only within the dialyser, but across the entire length of the ECC. As CD62p remained unaltered after the administration of LMWH 10 min before the actual start of HD, this kind of activation is independent of LMWH. Considering PF4 however, a sharp increment was observed after the administration of LMWH and before the start of HD. This finding suggests that the PF4 release observed early in clinical HD is largely independent from the ECC, and is probably the result of LMWH-induced detachment from the endothelium. As the platelet serotonin content was relatively reduced and the plasma serotonin levels were elevated, platelets from chronic HD patients might be depleted due to chronic repetitive activation. Based on these data, it appears first, that PF4 is an inferior marker of platelet activation in clinical HD and second, that LMWH is a major contributor to HD-induced bio-incompatibility.},

To overcome these challenges, the health department in Cologne has developed a software called DiKoMa. This software offers the possibility to track contact and index persons, but also provides a digital symptom diary. In this work, the question of whether these can also be used for diagnostic purposes will be investigated. Machine learning makes it possible to identify infections based on early symptom profiles and to distinguish between the predominant dominant variants. Focusing on the occurrence of the symptoms in the first week, a decision tree is trained for the differentiation between contact and index persons and the prevailing dominant variants (Wildtype, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron). The model is evaluated, using sex- and age-stratified cross-validation and validated by symptom profiles of the first 6 days. The variants achieve an AUC-ROC from 0.89 for Omicron and 0.6 for Alpha. No significant differences are observed for the results of the validation set (Alpha 0.63 and Omicron 0.87). The evaluation of symptom combinations using artificial intelligence can determine the individual risk for the presence of a COVID-19 infection, allows assignment to virus variants, and can contribute to the management of epidemics and pandemics on a national and international level. It can help to reduce the number of specific tests in times of low labor capacity and could help to early identify new virus variants.},

This was designed to evaluate treatment effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on clinical symptoms and important aspects of daily life including physical performance, sleep, social and work life, traveling, socioeconomic aspects, and quality of life. The questionnaire was completed by 73 respondents from 17 different countries. The mean duration of treatment was 15 months, the cumulative treatment time was 94.8 years. More than 80% of patients reported an improved quality of life. The number of hospitalizations was reduced (66% of patients), as well as the number of days absent from school or work. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment could be stopped in 49% of patients and reduced in another 42%. Clear improvement of neutropenia and all neutropenia-associated symptoms was reported by the majority of patients. Additionally, patients or caregivers reported positive effects on appetite (63%), level of activity (75%), overall well-being (96%), and sleep (63%).

Despite several modifications to the ASA physical status classification, multimorbidity as such is still not considered. Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify the burden of comorbidities in perioperative patients and to assess, independent of ASA class, its potential influence on perioperative outcome. In a subpopulation of the prospective ClassIntra® validation study from eight international centres, type and severity of anaesthesia-relevant comorbidities were additionally extracted from electronic medical records for the current study. Patients from the validation study were of all ages, undergoing any type of in-hospital surgery and were followed up until 30 days postoperatively to assess perioperative outcomes. Primary endpoint was the number of comorbidities across ASA classes. The associated postoperative length of hospital stay (pLOS) and Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI®) were secondary endpoints. On a scale from 0 (no complication) to 100 (death) the CCI® measures the severity of postoperative morbidity as a weighted sum of all postoperative complications. Of 1421 enrolled patients, the mean number of comorbidities significantly increased from 1.5 in ASA I (95% CI, 1.1-1.9) to 10.5 in ASA IV (95% CI, 8.3-12.7) patients. Furthermore, independent of ASA class, postoperative complications measured by the CCI® increased per each comorbidity by 0.81 (95% CI, 0.40-1.23) and so did pLOS (geometric mean ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06). These data quantify the high prevalence of multimorbidity in the surgical population and show that the number of comorbidities is predictive of negative postoperative outcomes, independent of ASA class.},

Here, we compared regional gray matter (GM) volumes and associated gene expression profiles between cognitively-defined subgroups of amyloid-β positive individuals clinically diagnosed with AD dementia (age: 66 ± 7, 47% male, MMSE: 21 ± 5). All participants underwent neuropsychological assessment with tests covering memory, executive-functioning, language and visuospatial-functioning domains. Subgroup classification was achieved using a psychometric framework that assesses which cognitive domain shows substantial relative impairment compared to the intra-individual average across domains, which yielded the following subgroups in our sample; AD-Memory (n = 41), AD-Executive (n = 117), AD-Language (n = 33), AD-Visuospatial (n = 171). We performed voxel-wise contrasts of GM volumes derived from 3Tesla structural MRI between subgroups and controls (n = 127, age 58 ± 9, 42% male, MMSE 29 ± 1), and observed that differences in regional GM volumes compared to controls closely matched the respective cognitive profiles. Specifically, we detected lower medial temporal lobe GM volumes in AD-Memory, lower fronto-parietal GM volumes in AD-Executive, asymmetric GM volumes in the temporal lobe (left < right) in AD-Language, and lower GM volumes in posterior areas in AD-Visuospatial. In order to examine possible biological drivers of these differences in regional GM volumes, we correlated subgroup-specific regional GM volumes to brain-wide gene expression profiles based on a stereotactic characterization of the transcriptional architecture of the human brain as provided by the Allen human brain atlas. Gene-set enrichment analyses revealed that variations in regional expression of genes involved in processes like mitochondrial respiration and metabolism of proteins were associated with patterns of regional GM volume across multiple subgroups. Other gene expression vs GM volume-associations were only detected in particular subgroups, e.g., genes involved in the cell cycle for AD-Memory, specific sets of genes related to protein metabolism in AD-Language, and genes associated with modification of gene expression in AD-Visuospatial. We conclude that cognitively-defined AD subgroups show neurobiological differences, and distinct biological pathways may be involved in the emergence of these differences.},

The EPR spectrum at 15 degrees K of soybean lipoxygenase-1 in borate buffer pH 9.0 has been studied in relation to the presence of substrate (linoleic acid), product (13-L-hydroperoxylinoleic acid) and oxygen. 2. The addition of 13-L-hydroperoxylinoleic acid to lipoxygenase-1 at pH 9.0 gives rise to the appearance of EPR lines at g equals 7.5, 6.2, 5.9 and 2.0, and an increased signal at g equals 4.3. 3. In view of the effect of the end product on both the kinetic lag period of the aerobic reaction and the fluorescence of the enzyme, it is concluded that 13-L-hydroperoxylinoleic acid is required for the activation of soybean lipoxygenase-1. Thus it is proposed that the enzyme with iron in the ferric state is the active species. 4. A reaction scheme is presented in which the enzyme alternatingly exists in the ferric and ferrous states for both the aerobic and anaerobic reaction.},

However, this process might also be estimated by the assessment of cell surface markers. In this study, the relationship between the expression of PMN degranulation markers (CD63 and CD66b) and the release of degranulation products [myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoferrin (LF)] was investigated during clinical HD in order to evaluate cell surface markers as a useful index of PMN degranulation. The expression of CD63 and CD66b on PMN and the release of MPO and LF were investigated in 10 chronic HD patients, during both heparin (HDhep) and trisodium citrate anticoagulation (HDcit), in a randomized order. Samples were drawn from both the efferent and afferent lines of the dialyzer at 0, 7.5, and 180 min. During HDhep at first passage, a major increase in MPO (from 158 +/- 32 to 448 +/- 177 microg/l, p = 0.001) and LF (from 134 +/- 52 to 260 +/- 120 microg/l, p = 0.01) was found across the dialyzer, whereas marked changes were not observed during HDcit. The expression of CD63 and CD66b increased across the dialyzer during both anticoagulation modalities, but was only significant in the case of HDhep (CD63: mean fluorescence intensity from 247 +/- 61 to 331 +/- 118, p < 0.01; CD66b: mean fluorescence intensity from 340 +/- 76 to 434 +/- 103, p = 0.01). During HDhep a correlation was noted between the degranulation products and markers of both azurophilic and specific granules (MPO and CD63: r = 0.35; p < 0.01; LF and CD66b: r = 0.39, p < 0.01). Significant differences in the expression of CD63 and CD66b between HDhep and HDcit were not observed. When analyzing the combined data for both HDhep and HDcit, no correlation was observed between degranulation products and markers. Our data suggest that the measurements of cell surface markers may not be a reliable indicator of the degree of HD-induced PMN degranulation.},

Eight patients were studied during HD with cellulose triacetate (CTA), cuprammonium (CU), and polysulphone (PS) dialysers in a randomized crossover design. In addition to total cell count and microscopic leukocyte differentiation, the expression of degranulation (CD63, CD66b) and adhesion (CD62L) markers on PMN was analysed in peripheral blood over time, and in dialyser eluates at the end of HD. In peripheral blood a significant drop in PMN was noted only during CU HD (P < 0.001), whereas none of the membranes induced any substantial change in the expression of the activation markers mentioned. In dialyser eluates the mean number of cells was 53 x 10(6), CTA yielding a significantly higher number as compared with CU (P = 0.05). The proportion of PMN was 81-91% (P < 0.05 versus peripheral blood). The expression of CD63, and especially CD66b, in dialyser eluates of all membranes was significantly higher in comparison with peripheral blood, whereas the expression of CD62L in dialyser eluates was considerably lower. Dialyser eluates of all three dialysers consisted mainly of PMN. Based on the relatively modest cell numbers and the expression of the activation markers described, our results suggest primarily degranulation within the dialyser. Apart from differences in cell numbers, CTA yielding the highest cell counts, no differences between CTA, CU, and PS could be demonstrated in dialyser eluates.},

However, since biocompatibility originates inside the dialyzer, white blood cells (WBC) adhering to the dialyzer are probably most subject to the influence of both dialyzer membrane and dialysate. In order to collect membrane-adherent cells, a reliable and reproducible elution technique was developed. After 3 h of HD, blood was returned to the patient with 0.9% NaCl. Then, dialyzers were eluted by recirculation of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS/3 mM EDTA for 20 min, with or without prior flushing with 200 ml PBS. Finally, remaining adherent cells were collected by an afterwash with 10% trypsin. These solutions, as well as blood samples, were analyzed for WBC count, viability and differentiation. Random eluate samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the influence of elution on PMN activation was tested in a separate control experiment. WBC numbers decreased by flushing before elution, whereas cell numbers were maximal after elution with PBS/3 mM EDTA (30 x 10(6)). Trypsin afterwash resulted in a further yield of 12 x 10(6) cells. The eluates contained 81% PMN (blood 68%, p < 0.01), with a degranulated appearance, and only 12% lymphocytes (blood 21%, p < 0.05); cell viability in the eluates was > 95%. The eluted cells could be analyzed by flow cytometry, and the procedure itself induced only minimal PMN activation. In conclusion, a maximal number of adherent cells, consisting mainly of PMN, was obtained by direct elution with PBS/3 mM EDTA. The method itself did not induce marked PMN activation, and the cells obtained were suitable for further investigations, including flow cytometry.},

  abstract = {During haemodialysis (HD), several adverse reactions in peripheral blood can occur, which have been attributed to the bioincompatibility of the dialyser membrane. Utilizing a dialyser elution technique, we have demonstrated that polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) manifested non-membrane dependent signs of activation during HD with cellulose triacetate (CTA), cuprammonium (CU) and polysulphone (PS) membranes. In the present study, we employed this elution technique to investigate the influence of HD with these membranes on lymphocytes. Eight patients were studied during HD with CTA, CU, and PS dialysers in a randomized crossover design. Dialyser elution was performed after 3 h of HD. Besides total leukocyte count and differentiation, lymphocyte subpopulations and activation status in peripheral blood and dialyser eluates were analysed by flow cytometry. Only with CU was a significant leukocyte decrease observed in peripheral blood at 30 min (P<0.001). Neither the total number of lymphocytes nor the proportion of T(CD3+) and B(CD19+) cells had markedly changed after HD with either membrane. Meanwhile, all membranes induced a relative decline in natural killer cells -NK(CD3-/CD16+/56+)- at the end of dialysis, although this was only significant for CTA (P=0.04). As for the T-lymphocyte subsets, the proportion of CD4+ cells had markedly increased after three hours of HD with all three dialysers, CTA and PS being significant (P<0.05). Dialyser eluates contained 33.8-82.2 x 10(6) cells, CTA yielding the highest cell counts. The majority (81-91%) of the eluted cells consisted of PMN dialyser eluates versus peripheral blood: P<0.05), whereas only few lymphocytes were found (4-13%, absolute 2.6 x 10(6)). Lymphocyte subpopulations in dialyser eluates were comparable to peripheral blood at t 180 in case of CTA and CU. In contrast PS eluates contained significantly fewer T-cells (37%), but more B-cells (22%) and NK-cells (30%) in comparison with peripheral blood at 180 min (peripheral blood: 79, 6 and 16% respectively; P<0.05). The expression of activation markers on T-cells (HLA-DR, CD25) in dialyser eluates was comparable with peripheral blood. Conclusions. The absolute number of lymphocytes in dialyser eluates of CTA, CU, and PS dialysers was low (mean 2.6 x 10(6)) in comparison with peripheral blood (mean 1.4 x 10(9)/l). Whereas non-selective adhesion occurred in CU and CTA dialysers, a selective adhesion pattern of lymphocyte subpopulations was observed in case of PS, suggesting a difference in bioincompatibility. Apparent T-cell activation was not noted, either in peripheral blood or in dialyser eluates. Because PMN in the dialyser eluates of three different membranes showed similar activation patterns in a previous study, we hypothesize that eluted lymphocyte, rather than PMN, represent a preferable parameter of bioincompatibility.},

  abstract = {Secretion of cytokines by monocytes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dialysis-related morbidity. Cytokine generation is presumed to take place in two steps: induction of mRNA transcription for cytokines by C5a and direct membrane contact, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced translation of mRNA (priming/second signal theory, Kidney Int 37: 85-93, 1990). However, the in vitro conditions on which this theory was based differed markedly from clinical dialysis. To test this postulate for routine hemodialysis, 13 patients were studied cross-over with high-flux cuprammonium (CU), cellulose triacetate (CTA), and polysulfon dialyzers, using standard bicarbonate dialysate, as well as CTA with filtered dialysate (fCTA). Besides leukocytes, C3a, C5a, and limulus amebocyte lysate reactivity, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-1RA, soluble TNF receptors, and IL-1 beta mRNA were assessed. Only during dialysis with CU did C5a increase significantly (561 to 8185 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Endotoxin content of standard bicarbonate was higher than filtered dialysate (median, 24.3 and < 5 pg/ml respectively, P = 0.002), whereas limulus amebocyte lysate reactivity was not detected in the blood, except in the case of CU. TNF-alpha levels were elevated before, and remained stable during, dialysis, independent of the modality used. IL-1 beta, IL-6, and mRNA coding for IL-1 beta could not be demonstrated. IL-1RA and soluble TNF receptors (p55/p75) were markedly elevated compared with normal control subjects, but showed no differences between fCTA and CTA. To summarize, no evidence was found for production and release of cytokines by monocytes during clinical high-flux bicarbonate hemodialysis, neither with complement-activating membranes nor with unfiltered dialysate. Therefore, this study sheds some doubt on the relevance of the "priming/second signal" theory for clinical practice. The data presented suggest that reluctance to prescribe the use of high-flux dialyzers, as advocated in many reports, may not be warranted.},

  abstract = {During haemodialysis (HD), an early and transient white blood cell (WBC) reduction is noted in the peripheral blood, which has been attributed mainly to the sequestration of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) in the pulmonary vasculature. However, WBC also adhere to the dialyser, as demonstrated before in an elution study performed after HD. In the present study, we investigated if intradialyser WBC sequestration contributes to the WBC nadir in the blood shortly after the start of HD and whether or not different mechanisms underlie PMN adherence in dialyser and lung. In addition, PMN degranulation was analysed not only in peripheral blood but also in dialyser eluates (DE). Dialysers were eluted after 7 1/2 (DE-7 1/2) and 180 (DE-180) min of HD in eight patients. Blood samples were taken before HD (t0), and at t7 1/2 and t180. Besides WBC count and differentiation, PMN adhesion (CD11b and CD62L) and degranulation markers (CD63 and CD66b) were assessed by flow cytometry. In the blood, a WBC fall was noted at t7 1/2 (from 5.8 to 4.8 x 10(9)/l; absolute about 5 x 10(9) cells). DE contained 3.0 x 10(6) cells at t7 1/2, and 57.2 x 10(6) at t180 (P = 0.015). As for CD11b, at t7 1/2 both in the blood and DE an increased expression was observed, as compared to t0 (P = 0.01); CD11b expression in DE-7 1/2 was higher than in DE-180 (P = 0.025). In contrast, CD62L showed downregulation only in DE both at t7 1/2 (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) PB 4172 and DE-7 1/2 2353, P = 0.01), and at t180 (MFI 794, P = 0.03 versus DE-7 1/2), when compared to blood at t0. As for degranulation markers, an increase was observed in blood at t7 1/2 (MFI CD63 from 357 to 506, P = 0.02; CD66b from 507 to 794, P = 0.001), in comparison with t0. Eluted PMN at t7 1/2 showed a higher expression of CD63 than PMN in blood at t7 1/2 and DE-180 (MFI in DE-7 1/2 1280 and blood 506, P = 0.003). The expression of CD66b was increased in DE-7 1/2 (MFI 1803 versus blood 794, P = 0.01), and even more in DE-180 (MFI 2763, P = 0.002), when compared to blood. From these data it is concluded first, that intradialyser PMN sequestration does not contribute markedly to the WBC nadir in the circulation. Second, intradialyser PMN trapping appears to result primarily from non-adhesion-molecule-mediated factors, as indicated by an increased expression of CD11b at t7 1/2 on eluted PMN associated with low cell numbers in DE, and normalized CD11b expression at t180 associated with considerably higher cell numbers in DE. Third, HD-induced degranulation seems to be a complex phenomenon. After a rapid transient onset, characterized by an early upregulation of CD63 and CD66b on PMN leaving the dialyser, degranulation continues within the device as indicated by an additional rise in the expression of CD66b on PMN in DE-180.},

We identify the muscle-specific protein Cullin-associated NEDD8-dissociated protein 2 (Cand2) as a translationally upregulated gene, dependent on the activity of mTOR. Deletion of Cand2 protects the myocardium against pathological remodeling. Mechanistically, we show that Cand2 links mTOR signaling to pathological cell growth by increasing Grk5 protein expression.

To inhibit hypertrophy therapeutically, the identification of negative regulators of cardiomyocyte protein synthesis is needed. Here, we identified the tumor suppressor protein TIP30 as novel inhibitor of cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. Reduced TIP30 levels in mice entailed exaggerated cardiac growth during experimental pressure overload, which was associated with cardiomyocyte cellular hypertrophy, increased myocardial protein synthesis, reduced capillary density, and left ventricular dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of protein synthesis improved these defects. Our results are relevant for human disease, since we found diminished cardiac TIP30 levels in samples from patients suffering from end-stage heart failure or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Importantly, therapeutic overexpression of TIP30 in mouse hearts inhibited cardiac hypertrophy and improved left ventricular function during pressure overload and in cardiomyopathic mdx mice. Mechanistically, we identified a previously unknown anti-hypertrophic mechanism, whereby TIP30 binds the eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) to prevent the interaction with its essential co-factor eEF1B2 and translational elongation. Therefore, TIP30 could be a therapeutic target to counteract cardiac hypertrophy.},

  abstract = {The APOE ε2 and APOE ε4 alleles are the strongest protective and risk-increasing, respectively, genetic variants for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the mechanisms linking APOE to AD-particularly the apoE protein's role in AD pathogenesis and how this is affected by APOE variants-remain poorly understood. Identifying missense variants in addition to APOE ε2 and APOE ε4 could provide critical new insights, but given the low frequency of additional missense variants, AD genetic cohorts have previously been too small to interrogate this question robustly. To determine whether rare missense variants on APOE are associated with AD risk. Association with case-control status was tested in a sequenced discovery sample (stage 1) and followed up in several microarray imputed cohorts as well as the UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing resource using a proxy-AD phenotype (stages 2 and 3). This study combined case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts that recruited referred and volunteer participants. Stage 1 included 37 409 nonunique participants of European or admixed European ancestry, with 11 868 individuals with AD and 11 934 controls passing analysis inclusion criteria. In stages 2 and 3, 475 473 participants were considered across 8 cohorts, of which 84 513 individuals with AD and proxy-AD and 328 372 controls passed inclusion criteria. Selection criteria were cohort specific, and this study was performed a posteriori on individuals who were genotyped. Among the available genotypes, 76 195 were excluded. All data were retrieved between September 2015 and November 2021 and analyzed between April and November 2021. In primary analyses, the AD risk associated with each missense variant was estimated, as appropriate, with either linear mixed-model regression or logistic regression. In secondary analyses, associations were estimated with age at onset using linear mixed-model regression and risk of conversion to AD using competing-risk regression. A total of 544 384 participants were analyzed in the primary case-control analysis; 312 476 (57.4%) were female, and the mean (SD; range) age was 64.9 (15.2; 40-110) years. Two missense variants were associated with a 2-fold to 3-fold decreased AD risk: APOE ε4 (R251G) (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.59; P = 4.7 × 10-8) and APOE ε3 (V236E) (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.56; P = 1.9 × 10-6). Additionally, the cumulative incidence of AD in carriers of these variants was found to grow more slowly with age compared with noncarriers. In this genetic association study, a novel variant associated with AD was identified: R251G always coinherited with ε4 on the APOE gene, which mitigates the ε4-associated AD risk. The protective effect of the V236E variant, which is always coinherited with ε3 on the APOE gene, was also confirmed. The location of these variants confirms that the carboxyl-terminal portion of apoE plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. The large risk reductions reported here suggest that protein chemistry and functional assays of these variants should be pursued, as they have the potential to guide drug development targeting APOE.},

  abstract = {Guidelines for the management of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) recommend external ventricular drainage for CSF drainage as a first-tier treatment in the intracranial pressure (ICP) pathway. However, ventriculostomy in children can sometimes be challenging because of the small size of the lateral ventricles. External lumbar drainage (ELD) may be a useful alternative; therefore, the authors analyzed the outcome of a cohort of pediatric patients who underwent ELD to manage intracranial hypertension (ICH). This study retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients with ICH following severe TBI who underwent ELD. Radiological and clinical severity scores (Marshall classification, Rotterdam score, Injury Severity Score, and Pediatric Trauma Score) were noted. ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) curves were analyzed 12 hours before and after the procedure. Any change in medical therapy was recorded, as well as the total volume and duration of drainage. Cerebellar tonsillar position according to the McRae line was noted before and after ELD. Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score at follow-up was also noted. Thirty patients were included, with a mean age of 8 ± 4.4 years, and a median admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7 ± 4 (range 3-13). ELD was performed after a median delay of 1 day (range 0-7 days), mean drainage volume/day was 296 ± 129 ml, and median duration of drainage was 7 ± 5 (range 2-12) days. Forty-three percent of the patients underwent ELD as a part of the first-tier therapy. ICP decreased after ELD (mean difference 13.4 ± 6.2 mm Hg, p < 0.001), whereas CPP increased (mean difference 10.6 ± 6.4 mm Hg, p < 0.001). Fifty-three percent of the cohort did not need any further second-tier therapy after ELD. The study found 1 case of drain revision and 3 cases of cerebellar tonsil herniation. These preliminary data suggest ELD is a valuable option to treat ICH in severely head-injured children, limiting the use of second-tier treatments. This pilot study should lay the foundation for a multicenter prospective trial.},

By comparing mid-infrared photothermal spectra of label-free and GFP-tagged huntingtin inclusions, we demonstrate that GFP fusions indeed perturb the secondary structure of aggregates. By implementing spectra with small spatial step for dissecting spectral features within sub-micrometer distances, we reveal that huntingtin inclusions partition into a β-sheet-rich core and a ɑ-helix-rich shell. We further demonstrate that this structural partition exists only in cells with the [RNQ},

Since granule exocytosis from neutrophils is regulated by ion fluxes, we examined the effect of protein I on neutrophil activation. Pretreatment with protein I (250 nM) impaired degranulation from neutrophils: beta-glucuronidase release decreased to 27 +/- 6% S.E. of cells treated with N-f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP, 0.1 microM) and to 13 +/- 4% of cells treated with leukotriene B4 (LTB4, 0.1 microM); lysozyme release decreased to 52 +/- 17% of fMLP-treated cells and 22 +/- 9% of LTB4-treated cells. Morphometric analysis was consistent: control neutrophils increased their surface membrane after fMLP (43.3 +/- 5.6 microns relative perimeter versus 71.4 +/- 3.7 microns) while protein I-treated neutrophils did not (29.4 +/- 2 (S.E.) microns relative perimeter versus 34 +/- 4 microns). Enzyme release after exposure to phorbol myristate acetate was not affected (lysozyme: 86 +/- 27% of control). Cell/cell aggregation in response to fMLP was inhibited by treatment with protein I. However, generation of O2 was not affected. Protein I altered the surface membrane potential (Oxonol V): protein I evoked a transient membrane hyperpolarization which was not inhibited by furosemide. After exposure to fMLP, protein I-treated neutrophils underwent a furosemide-sensitive hyperpolarization rather than the usual depolarization. Protein I did not alter increments in [Ca]i (Fura-2) stimulated by fMLP (460 +/- 99 nM (S.E.) versus 377 +/- 44 nM) nor decrements in [pH]i (7.22 +/- 0.04 S.E. versus 7.22 +/- 0.02, bis-(carboxy-ethyl)carboxyfluorescein).

To get closer insight into optic nerve meningeal-derived ECM composition, we performed proteomic analysis of the sheep optic nerve subarachnoid space (SAS). Candidate components were confirmed in cultures of primary human meningothelial cells (phMECs) and human optic nerve samples. Sheep optic nerve SAS samples were analysed by LC-MS, identified proteins were matched to their human orthologs and filtered using gene lists representing all major ECM components. To validate these findings digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) to evaluate mRNA expression of all candidate components identified was performed on cultures of phMECs. In addition, one protein per major ECM group was stained on human optic nerve sections and on phMEC cultures. Employing LC-MS, 1273 proteins were identified and subjected to bioinformatic analysis. Gene ontology analysis revealed six out of forty-four collagen types (1A1, 1A2, 3A1, 6A2, 6A3 and 14A1), three out of eleven laminin subunits (A4, B2, C1) and six out of twenty-seven hyaluronan binding proteins (CD44, versican (VCAN), C1q binding protein, neurocan (NCAN), brevican (BCAN) and hyalaluronan proteoglycan link protein 2 (HAPLN2)) were present in our cohort. DdPCR in phMEC cell culture confirmed presence of all candidate components except NCAN, BCAN and HAPLN2. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining on human optic nerve sections and immunofluorescence (IF) staining on in vitro cultured phMECs showed strong immunopositivity for collagen-typeI-α1 (COL1A1), lamininγ1 (LAMC1), and VCAN. Fibronectin (FN1) was exclusively present in cultures of phMECs. Using a combined bioinformatics and immunohistological approach, we describe the ECM composition of the optic nerve subarachnoid space. As this space plays an important role in maintaining optic nerve function, a better understanding of ECM composition in this delicate environment might be key to further pathophysiological insight into optic nerve degeneration and associated disorders.},

The constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN), a subcomplex of the kinetochore, associates with centromeric chromatin and provides a platform for the kinetochore assembly. The CCAN protein CENP-C is thought to be a central hub for the centromere/kinetochore organization. However, the role of CENP-C in CCAN assembly needs to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that both the CCAN-binding domain and the C-terminal region that includes the Cupin domain of CENP-C are necessary and sufficient for chicken CENP-C function. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal self-oligomerization of the Cupin domains of chicken and human CENP-C. We find that the CENP-C Cupin domain oligomerization is vital for CENP-C function, centromeric localization of CCAN, and centromeric chromatin organization. These results suggest that CENP-C facilitates the centromere/kinetochore assembly through its oligomerization.},

It consists of a regulatory region containing a cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain and a catalytic region that activates Rap. In the absence of cAMP, access of Rap to the catalytic site is blocked by the regulatory region. We analyzed the conformational states of the CNB domain in the absence and in the presence of cAMP and cAMP analogues by NMR spectroscopy, resulting in the first direct insights into the activation mechanism of Epac. We prove that the CNB domain exists in equilibrium between the inactive and the active conformation, which is shifted by binding of cAMP. cAMP binding results in conformational changes in both the ligand binding pocket and the outer helical segments. We used two different cAMP antagonists that block these successive changes to elucidate the steps of this process. Highlighting the role of dynamics, the superactivator 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP induces similar conformational changes as cAMP but causes different internal mobility. The results reveal the critical elements of the CNB domain of Epac required for activation and highlight the role of dynamics in this process.},

Unfortunately, the current measures have their weaknesses when it comes to assessing certain edge cases. These limitations arise when images with a very small region of interest or without a region of interest at all are assessed. As a solution to these limitations, we propose a new medical image segmentation metric: MISm. This metric is a composition of the Dice similarity coefficient and the weighted specificity. MISm was investigated for definition gaps, an appropriate scoring gradient, and different weighting coefficients used to propose a constant value. Furthermore, an evaluation was performed by comparing the popular metrics in the medical image segmentation and MISm using images of magnet resonance tomography from several fictitious prediction scenarios. Our analysis shows that MISm can be applied in a general way and thus also covers the mentioned edge cases, which are not covered by other metrics, in a reasonable way. In order to allow easy access to MISm and therefore widespread application in the community, as well as reproducibility of experimental results, we included MISm in the publicly available evaluation framework MISeval.},

  abstract = {Many lines of evidence suggest that a reciprocally interconnected network comprising the amygdala, ventral hippocampus (vHC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) participates in different aspects of the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses and fear behavior. This could at least in part be mediated by direct connections from mPFC or vHC to amygdala to control amygdala activity and output. However, currently the interactions between mPFC and vHC afferents and their specific targets in the amygdala are still poorly understood. Here, we use an ex-vivo optogenetic approach to dissect synaptic properties of inputs from mPFC and vHC to defined neuronal populations in the basal amygdala (BA), the area that we identify as a major target of these projections. We find that BA principal neurons (PNs) and local BA interneurons (INs) receive monosynaptic excitatory inputs from mPFC and vHC. In addition, both these inputs also recruit GABAergic feedforward inhibition in a substantial fraction of PNs, in some neurons this also comprises a slow GABAB-component. Amongst the innervated PNs we identify neurons that project back to subregions of the mPFC, indicating a loop between neurons in mPFC and BA, and a pathway from vHC to mPFC via BA. Interestingly, mPFC inputs also recruit feedforward inhibition in a fraction of INs, suggesting that these inputs can activate dis-inhibitory circuits in the BA. A general feature of both mPFC and vHC inputs to local INs is that excitatory inputs display faster rise and decay kinetics than in PNs, which would enable temporally precise signaling. However, mPFC and vHC inputs to both PNs and INs differ in their presynaptic release properties, in that vHC inputs are more depressing. In summary, our data describe novel wiring, and features of synaptic connections from mPFC and vHC to amygdala that could help to interpret functions of these interconnected brain areas at the network level.},

These anomalies were found in 30% of the patients with low anorectal malformations, and in 50% with high anorectal malformations. In patients with urogenital malformations, MRI more often showed spinal anomalies (13/21, 62%) than in patients without (7/22, 32%). In high anorectal malformations, defaecation was more often a problem in patients with spinal anomalies (12/15, 80%) than in patients without (2/8, 25%). Spinal anomalies in the lumbosacral region were found with MRI in 46.5% of patients with anorectal malformations.

Eighteen healthy female subjects (aged 20-31) participated in a double-blinded, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, within subjects, repeated measures study. They were assessed on two randomly assigned occasions that were controlled for menstrual cycle phase. In a randomized order, one day, acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) was used to reduce 5-HT synthesis in the brain. On the other day, participants received a tryptophan-balanced amino acid load (BAL) as a control condition. Three hours after administration of ATD/BAL, neural activity was recorded during a modified Go/No-Go task implementing reward or punishment processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neural activation during No-Go trials in punishment conditions after BAL versus ATD administration correlated positively with the magnitude of central 5-HT depletion in the ventral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). Furthermore, neural activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and the dorsal ACC correlated positively with trait impulsivity. The results indicate reduced neural sensitivity to punishment after short-term depletion of 5-HT in brain areas related to emotion regulation (subgenual ACC) increasing with depletion magnitude and in brain areas related to appraisal and expression of emotions (mOFC and dorsal ACC), increasing with trait impulsivity. This suggests a serotonergic modulation of neural circuits related to emotion regulation, impulsive behavior, and punishment processing in females.},

Q-TOF MSMS allowed sequencing of about 70% of all amino acids in Mal d 1 and about 60% of those in Bet v 1. Mixing experiments with rBet v 1 isoforms and with rMal d 1 and nMal d 1 revealed that the technique allows identification of isoforms in mixtures down to a level of at least 5%. Recombinant Mal d 1 was identified as a Mal d 1a representative, whereas Granny Smith apples were shown to contain Mal d 1b-like allergen isoforms. In this apple cultivar hitherto unreported modifications of Mal d 1b were identified. Q-TOF MSMS allowed semiquantitative measurement of allergen at the femtomole to picomole level.

Most patients (60/61) had a metastatic DedM showing most frequently an unclassified pleomorphic, spindle cell, or small round cell morphology akin to undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma, rarely associated with heterologous elements. Overall, among 20 successfully analysed tissue samples from 16 patients, we found retained melanoma-like MS in only 7 tissue samples while a non-melanoma-like MS was observed in 13 tissue samples. In two patients from whom multiple specimens were analysed, some of the samples had a preserved cutaneous melanoma MS while other specimens exhibited an epigenetic shift towards a mesenchymal/sarcoma-like profile, matching the histological features. In these two patients, CNP was largely identical across all analysed specimens, in line with their common clonal origin, despite significant modification of their epigenome. Our study further highlights that DedM represents a real diagnostic challenge.

  abstract = {Cancer recurrence after treatment is a concern for patients and oncologists alike. The movement towards treatment optimization, with trials testing less than the current standard of care (SoC), complicates this experience. Our objective was to assess oncologists' psychological response to patient recurrence on optimization-focused trials and identify factors that influence those experiences. Clinical oncologists participated in a semi-structured interview regarding patient enrollment in treatment optimization trials. We identified factors that influence the degree of psychological response that the oncologist may feel after patient recurrence. Residual agreement analysis was used to identify whether differences in reported psychological response was associated with alternative emphases on identified factors. Thirty-six oncologists identified 20 factors spanning five major themes that affected their psychological response to patient recurrence. All oncologists expressed willingness to enroll patients in treatment optimization clinical trials; however, half indicated that they were more likely to experience a negative psychological response after a treatment optimization trial than after a traditional intensification trial, and a quarter reported that patient recurrence on an optimization trial would impact their recommendations for future trial enrollment. Oncologists who reported more negative psychological responses to patient recurrence after participation in an optimization trial were more likely to emphasize introspective factors, while those who reported no difference in response emphasized patient- and process-focused factors. Although most oncologists recognize the importance of treatment optimization trials, a significant proportion indicated a greater potential for psychological distress following patient recurrence in such trials and offered insight into how trial design and the process of patient enrollment can be improved to minimize those negative psychological responses.},

It is not clear, whether infants with CMA have an increased risk of developing other allergic diseases later in life, the so-called "allergic march". We aimed to detect genetic associations of CMA using reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in other allergic diseases and genetic mutations within the filaggrin (FLG) gene. Both to investigate possible causes of CMA, which also suggests an "allergic march". Thirty children from the Dutch EuroPrevall birth cohort study with CMA in infancy and twenty-three healthy controls were studied. Six candidate SNPs were selected (minor allele frequency 10-50 % combined with a large effect) based on the literature. Thirteen FLG candidate mutations were selected spread over repeats 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 respectively. We found two SNP's, rs17616434 (P = 0.002) and rs2069772 (P = 0.038), significantly associated with CMA. One is located near the toll like receptor 6 (TLR6) gene, which functionally interacts with toll-like receptor 2, and is associated with an increased risk of other allergic diseases. One is located at the Interleukin 2 (IL2) locus. Twelve FLG amplicons were analyzed, but showed no significant enrichment. Nevertheless, we did observe more FLG mutations in the CMA-group compared to controls. We significantly associated two SNPs with CMA, suggesting that variation in the TLR6 and IL2 genes contribute to the expression of CMA. In addition, since TLR6 and IL2 were earlier associated with other later onset allergies, this also favours the "allergic march" hypothesis. We observed more FLG mutations in the CMA-group, albeit we found no statistical significant enrichment of FLG mutations. Further studies are necessary to investigate the role of common variants and FLG or other skin barrier gene mutations in CMA.},

  abstract = {When stroke patients with suspected anterior large vessel occlusion (aLVO) happen to live in rural areas, two main options exist for prehospital transport: (i) the drip-and-ship (DnS) strategy, which ensures rapid access to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) at the nearest primary stroke center but requires time-consuming interhospital transfer for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) because the latter is only available at comprehensive stroke centers (CSC); and (ii) the mothership (MS) strategy, which entails direct transport to a CSC and allows for faster access to EVT but carries the risk of IVT being delayed or even the time window being missed completely. The use of a helicopter might shorten the transport time to the CSC in rural areas. However, if the aLVO stroke is only recognized by the emergency service on site, the helicopter must be requested in addition, which extends the prehospital time and partially negates the time advantage. We hypothesized that parallel activation of ground and helicopter transportation in case of aLVO suspicion by the dispatcher (aLVO-guided dispatch strategy) could shorten the prehospital time in rural areas and enable faster treatment with IVT and EVT. As a proof-of-concept, we report a case from the LESTOR trial where the dispatcher suspected an aLVO stroke during the emergency call and dispatched EMS and HEMS in parallel. Based on this case, we compare the provided aLVO-guided dispatch strategy to the DnS and MS strategies regarding the times to IVT and EVT using a highly realistic modeling approach. With the aLVO-guided dispatch strategy, the patient received IVT and EVT faster than with the DnS or MS strategies. IVT was administered 6 min faster than in the DnS strategy and 22 min faster than in the MS strategy, and EVT was started 47 min earlier than in the DnS strategy and 22 min earlier than in the MS strategy. In rural areas, parallel activation of ground and helicopter emergency services following dispatcher identification of stroke patients with suspected aLVO could provide rapid access to both IVT and EVT, thereby overcoming the limitations of the DnS and MS strategies.},

Here, we identify and characterize a mannosyltransferase gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, which is the functional homolog of the ALG3 (Dol-P-Man:Man5GlcNAc2-PP-Dol alpha1,3-mannosyl transferase) gene in yeast. The At ALG3 protein can complement a Deltaalg3 yeast mutant and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in yeast and in plants. A homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant, alg3-2, was identified in Arabidopsis with residual levels of wild-type ALG3, derived from incidental splicing of the 11th intron carrying the T-DNAs. N-glycan analysis of alg3-2 and alg3-2 in the complex-glycan-less mutant background, which lacks N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase I activity, reveals that when ALG3 activity is strongly reduced, almost all N-glycans transferred to proteins are aberrant, indicating that the Arabidopsis oligosaccharide transferase complex is remarkably substrate tolerant. In alg3-2 plants, the aberrant glycans on glycoproteins are recognized by endogenous mannosidase I and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and efficiently processed into complex-type glycans. Although no high-mannose-type glycoproteins are detected in alg3-2 plants, these plants do not show a growth phenotype under normal growth conditions. However, the glycosylation abnormalities result in activation of marker genes diagnostic of the unfolded protein response.},

In contrast to AtGnTI-YFP, only low levels of HuGnTI-YFP protein was detected in transgenic plants. In protoplast co-transfection experiments all GnTI-YFP fusion proteins co-localized with a Golgi marker protein, but only limited co-localization of AtGnTI and HuGnTI in the same plant protoplast. The partial alternative targeting of HuGnTI in plant protoplasts was alleviated by exchanging the membrane-anchor domain with that of AtGnTI, but in stably transformed cgl1-1 plants this chimeric GnTI still did not lead to full complementation of the cgl1-1 phenotype. Combined, the results indicate that activity of HuGnTI in plants is limited by a combination of reduced protein stability, alternative protein targeting and possibly to some extend to lower enzymatic performance of the catalytic domain in the plant biochemical environment.},

Previously, we described an Arabidopsis alg3-2 glycosylation mutant in which aberrant Man(5)GlcNAc(2) mannose type N-glycans are transferred to proteins. Here we show that the alg3-2 mutation reduces the N-glycan heterogeneity on ER resident glycoproteins in seeds. We compared the properties of a scFv-Fc, with a KDEL ER retention tag (MBP10) that was expressed in seeds of wild type and alg3-2 plants. N-glycans on these antibodies from mutant seeds were predominantly of the intermediate Man(5)GlcNAc(2) compared to Man(8)GlcNAc(2) and Man(7)GlcNAc(2) isoforms on MBP10 from wild-type seeds. The presence of aberrant N-glycans on MBP10 did not seem to affect MBP10 dimerisation nor binding of MBP10 to its antigen. In alg3-2 the fraction of underglycosylated MBP10 protein forms was higher than in wild type. Interestingly, the expression of MBP10 resulted also in underglycosylation of other, endogenous glycoproteins.},

  abstract = {Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an important staple food. However, wheat gluten proteins cause celiac disease (CD) in 0.5 to 1% of the general population. Among these proteins, the alpha-gliadins contain several peptides that are associated to the disease. We obtained 230 distinct alpha-gliadin gene sequences from severaldiploid wheat species representing the ancestral A, B, and D genomes of the hexaploid bread wheat. The large majority of these sequences (87%) contained an internal stop codon. All alpha-gliadin sequences could be distinguished according to the genome of origin on the basis of sequence similarity, of the average length of the polyglutamine repeats, and of the differences in the presence of four peptides that have been identified as T cell stimulatory epitopes in CD patients through binding to HLA-DQ2/8. By sequence similarity, alpha-gliadins from the public database of hexaploid T. aestivum could be assigned directly to chromosome 6A, 6B, or 6D. T. monococcum (A genome) sequences, as well as those from chromosome 6A of bread wheat, almost invariably contained epitope glia-alpha9 and glia-alpha20, but never the intact epitopes glia-alpha and glia-alpha2. A number of sequences from T. speltoides, as well as a number of sequences fromchromosome 6B of bread wheat, did not contain any of the four T cell epitopes screened for. The sequences from T. tauschii (D genome), as well as those from chromosome 6D of bread wheat, were found to contain all of these T cell epitopes in variable combinations per gene. The differences in epitope composition resulted mainly from point mutations. These substitutions appeared to be genome specific. Our analysis shows that alpha-gliadin sequences from the three genomes of bread wheat form distinct groups. The four known T cell stimulatory epitopes are distributed non-randomly across the sequences, indicating that the three genomes contribute differently to epitope content. A systematic analysis of all known epitopes in gliadins and glutenins will lead to better understanding of the differences in toxicity among wheat varieties. On the basis of such insight, breeding strategies can be designed to generate less toxic varieties of wheat which may be tolerated by at least part of the CD patient population.},

Nicotiana benthamiana is deployed at commercial scale for production of therapeutic proteins. Here the potential of this plant is explored for rapid production of precursors of artemisinin, a sesquiterpenoid compound that is used for malaria treatment. Biosynthetic genes leading to artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin, were combined and expressed in N. benthamiana by agro-infiltration. The first committed precursor of artemisinin, amorpha-4,11-diene, was produced upon infiltration of a construct containing amorpha-4,11-diene synthase, accompanied by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Amorpha-4,11-diene was detected both in extracts and in the headspace of the N. benthamiana leaves. When the amorphadiene oxidase CYP71AV1 was co-infiltrated with the amorphadiene-synthesizing construct, the amorpha-4,11-diene levels strongly decreased, suggesting it was oxidized. Surprisingly, no anticipated oxidation products, such as artemisinic acid, were detected upon GC-MS analysis. However, analysis of leaf extracts with a non-targeted metabolomics approach, using LC-QTOF-MS, revealed the presence of another compound, which was identified as artemisinic acid-12-β-diglucoside. This compound accumulated to 39.5 mg x kg(-1) fwt. Apparently the product of the heterologous pathway that was introduced, artemisinic acid, is further metabolized efficiently by glycosyl transferases that are endogenous to N. benthamiana. This work shows that agroinfiltration of N. bentamiana can be used as a model to study the production of sesquiterpenoid pharmaceutical compounds. The interaction between the ectopically introduced pathway and the endogenous metabolism of the plant is discussed.},

Prehospital identification of these symptoms is generally considered difficult by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. Therefore, we evaluated the simple non-paretic-hand-to-opposite-ear (NPE) test to identify aphasia and neglect with a single test. As the NPE test includes a test for arm paresis, we also evaluated the diagnostic ability of the NPE test to detect LAVO in patients with suspected stroke. In this prospective observational study, we performed the NPE test in 1042 patients with suspected acute stroke between May 2021 and May 2022. We analyzed the correlation between the NPE test and the aphasia/neglect items of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Additionally, the predictive values of the NPE test for LAVO detection were calculated. The NPE test showed a strong, significant correlation with both aphasia and neglect. A positive NPE test result predicted LAVO with a sensitivity of 0.70, a specificity of 0.88, and an accuracy of 0.85. Logistic regression analysis showed an odds ratio of 16.14 (95% confidence interval 10.82-24.44) for predicting LAVO. The NPE test is a simple test for the detection of both aphasia and neglect. With its predictive values for LAVO detection being comparable to the results of LAVO scores in the prehospital setting, this simple test might be a promising test for prehospital LAVO detection by EMS personnel. Further prospective prehospital validation is needed.},

This simulation study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of identifying side-specific arm paresis, side-specific conjugate eye deviation (CED), and aphasia during emergency calls by instructing layperson callers to perform brief, standardized examination steps. Two communication methods were compared: (1) telephone calls and (2) video calls. Forty-eight laypersons interacted with simulated patients presenting various stroke syndromes. Simulated EMDs conducted standardized assessments during simulated emergency calls, guiding laypersons through patient examinations. In 96 telephone-assisted and 95 video-assisted calls, EMDs identified aLVO stroke symptoms with high accuracy. In telephone calls, accuracy was 0.92 for side-specific arm paresis, 0.98 for side-specific CED, and 0.88-0.99 for aphasia. In video calls, accuracy was 0.97 for side-specific arm paresis, 0.97 for side-specific CED, and 0.94-1.00 for aphasia. These findings suggest that EMDs can identify stroke symptoms indicative for aLVO via both telephone and video calls using a standardized dispatch protocol to guide lay bystanders.

We analysed the number of steps required for the completion of the FRENS algorithm. Among the 1042 analysed patients, the FRENS items showed high convergent validity with corresponding NIHSS items. A positive FRENS was statistically significantly correlated with an aLVO stroke. The FRENS had the highest sensitivity and negative predictive values for an aLVO stroke and the highest sensitivity value for M2 occlusions. The FRENS provided results after two and all four steps, in 71% and <3% of cases, respectively. The FRENS enabled the rapid, sensitive detection of an aLVO in patients with suspected acute stroke. Designed for use in emergency calls, the FRENS requires translation and validation in a prehospital setting.},

Two different types of galactosylated N-glycans have initially been reported in plants as the result of expression of human β1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (GalT). Here we show that these differences are associated with differences at its N-terminus: the natural short variant of human GalT results in hybrid type N-glycans, whereas the long form generates bi-antennary complex type N-glycans. Furthermore, expression of non-mammalian, chicken and zebrafish GalT homologues with N-termini resembling the short human GalT N-terminus also induce hybrid type N-glycans. Providing both non-mammalian GalTs with a 13 amino acid N-terminal extension that distinguishes the two naturally occurring forms of human GalT, acted to increase the levels of bi-antennary galactosylated N-glycans when expressed in tobacco leaves. Replacement of the cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain of chicken and zebrafish GalTs with the corresponding region of rat α2,6-sialyltransferase yielded a gene whose expression enhanced the level of bi-antennary galactosylation even further.},

C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), suPAR, CURB-65 and Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) scores were measured at admission, and patients were followed for 365 days. The primary outcome was the relationship between suPAR levels and CAP severity based on IDSA/ATS guidelines. Secondary outcomes included time to clinical stability (TTCS), length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Among 204 patients, 174 (85%) had non-severe and 30 (15%) had severe CAP. SuPAR levels were not associated with severe CAP (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.21; AUC 0.53). Unlike the PSI and CURB-65 scores, suPAR did not correlate with TTCS (HR PSI 0.80, HR CURB-65 0.86), though all three markers were correlated to LOS (AUC suPAR 0.61). Only suPAR was significantly associated with 30-day mortality (HR 1.51, AUC 0.68). The prognostic value of suPAR for CAP severity is low, and it does not provide additional prognostic benefit over the CURB-65 or PSI scores in predicting CAP severity. While it has moderate predictive ability for 30-day mortality, its utility for predicting LOS or TTCS is low. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01964495.},

  abstract = {In ubiquitin conjugation, different combinations of E2 and E3 enzymes catalyse either monoubiquitination or ubiquitin chain formation. The E2/E3 complex Rad6/Rad18 exclusively monoubiquitinates the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to signal for "error prone" DNA damage tolerance, whereas a different set of conjugation enzymes is required for ubiquitin chain formation on PCNA. Here we show that human E2 enzyme Rad6b is intrinsically capable of catalyzing ubiquitin chain formation. This activity is prevented during PCNA ubiquitination by the interaction of Rad6 with E3 enzyme Rad18. Using NMR and X-ray crystallography we show that the R6BD of Rad18 inhibits this activity by competing with ubiquitin for a noncovalent "backside" binding site on Rad6. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how E3 enzymes can regulate the ubiquitin conjugation process.},

  abstract = {Dimenhydrinate (DMH), used to alleviate motion sickness symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and vertigo, encounters limitations in oral pharmaceutical formulations due to its poor water solubility and bitter taste. Our research hypothesized that inclusion complexation with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) might address these drawbacks while ensuring that the newly formed complexes exhibit no cytotoxic or genotoxic effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Inclusion complexes were prepared using the kneading method and the solvent evaporation method. The phase solubility analysis, attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were conducted to evaluate the complexation efficacy and stability constant of the new binary systems. The results demonstrated that both methods provided complete and efficient complexation. Cytogenotoxic analysis, including the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, alkaline comet assay, and cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-cyt) assay, was conducted to assess the cytogenotoxic potential of DMH-β-CD inclusion complexes, a topic previously unexamined. No cytotoxic or genotoxic effects were observed within the concentration range of 36.36 to 109.09 ng/mL. Cell viability of treated PBMCs exceeded 85% for all tested concentrations. No significant increases in DNA strand breaks were observed at any dose, and tail intensity of all complexes remained lower or up to 2.2% higher than the negative control. Parameters indicating genotoxic effects, as well as cytotoxic and cytostatic potential in the CBMN-cyt assay, did not significantly differ from untreated controls. These results suggest that inclusion complexation with β-CD might be a safe and promising solution to overcome the limitations of poor solubility and unpleasant taste of DMH, potentially providing opportunities for new and improved oral pharmaceutical dosage forms.},

  abstract = {In standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), rescuers switch between ventilation and chest compressions. We examined the effect of this task-switching requirement on chest-compression quality to gain insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying performance in standard CPR. Understanding these mechanisms can help in the development of evidence-based practical implications and cognitive aids for CPR. A total of 300 first-year medical and dentistry students (212 females, 20.2 ± 4.4 years) participated in this randomized controlled trial. They received either a CPR training comprising both chest compressions and ventilation (standard CPR) or a CPR training comprising chest compressions only (chest-compression-only CPR). Chest-compression quality (compression depth and rate) was measured via a resuscitation manikin and analyzed using linear mixed models and linear trend analyses. Overall, chest-compression quality did not differ across standard CPR and chest-compression-only CPR. However, in standard CPR, compression quality was better after ventilation than before ventilation. Importantly, ventilation impaired the quality of the compressions executed immediately after ventilation, but the quality increased with each compression after ventilation, resulting in a better chest-compression quality after ventilation than before it. This study suggests that ventilation acts as a break, improving physical capability, which in turn enhances compressions after ventilation. However, at the same time, ventilation causes a task switch which increases cognitive demands and impairs chest-compression quality immediately after ventilation. Considering the negative effect of the task-switching demand on chest-compression quality, it is useful to develop cognitive aids for professional medical care. Such cognitive aids can signal an upcoming switch to ventilation, thereby reducing the multitasking load in terms of reduced monitoring demands with respect to the number of chest compressions that have already been executed.},

To address these challenges, we used a design of experiments approach to develop an optimized induction protocol for the cultivation of tobacco hairy roots secreting the full-size monoclonal antibody M12. The antibody yield was enhanced 30-fold by the addition of 14 g/L KNO3 , 19 mg/L 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 1.5 g/L of the stabilizing agent polyvinylpyrrolidone. Analysis of hairy root cross sections revealed that the optimized medium induced lateral root formation and morphological changes in the inner cortex and pericycle cells, indicating that the improved productivity was at least partially based on the enhanced efficiency of antibody secretion. We found that 57% of the antibody was secreted, yielding 5.9 mg of product per liter of induction medium. Both the secreted and intracellular forms of the antibody could be isolated by protein A affinity chromatography and their functionality was confirmed using vitronectin-binding assays. Glycan analysis revealed three major plant complex-type glycans on both forms of the antibody, although the secreted form was more homogeneous due to the predominance of a specific glycoform. Tobacco hairy root cultures therefore offer a practical solution for the production of homogeneous pharmaceutical antibodies in containment.},

Passive immunization with anti-αSyn antibodies is a promising method to slow down the spreading process and thereby the progression of synucleinopathies. Currently, it remains elusive which specific characteristics are essential to render therapeutic antibodies efficacious. Here, we established a neuronal co-culture model, in which αSyn species are being released from αSyn-overexpressing cells and induce toxicity in a priori healthy GFP-expressing cells. In this model, we investigated the protective efficacy of three anti-αSyn antibodies. Only two of these antibodies, one C-terminal and one N-terminal, protected from αSyn-induced toxicity by inhibiting the uptake of spreading-competent αSyn from the cell culture medium. Neither the binding epitope nor the affinity of the antibodies towards recombinant αSyn could explain differences in biological efficacy. However, both protective antibodies formed more stable antibody-αSyn complexes than the non-protective antibody. These findings indicate that the stability of antibody-αSyn complexes may be more important to confer protection than the binding epitope or affinity to recombinant αSyn.},

  abstract = {Large uncertainties characterize forest development under global climate change. Although recent studies have found widespread increased tree mortality, the patterns and processes associated with tree death remain poorly understood, thus restricting accurate mortality predictions. Yet, projections of future forest dynamics depend critically on robust mortality models, preferably based on empirical data rather than theoretical, not well-constrained assumptions. We developed parsimonious mortality models for individual beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees and evaluated their potential for incorporation in dynamic vegetation models (DVMs). We used inventory data from nearly 19,000 trees from unmanaged forests in Switzerland, Germany, and Ukraine, representing the largest dataset used to date for calibrating such models. Tree death was modelled as a function of size and growth, i.e., stem diameter (dbh) and relative basal area increment (relBAI), using generalized logistic regression accounting for unequal re-measurement intervals. To explain the spatial and temporal variability in mortality patterns, we considered a large set of environmental and stand characteristics. Validation with independent datasets was performed to assess model generality. Our results demonstrate strong variability in beech mortality that was independent of environmental or stand characteristics. Mortality patterns in Swiss and German strict forest reserves were dominated by competition processes as indicated by J-shaped mortality over tree size and growth. The Ukrainian primeval beech forest was additionally characterized by windthrow and a U-shaped size-mortality function. Unlike the mortality model based on Ukrainian data, the Swiss and German models achieved good discrimination and acceptable transferability when validated against each other. We thus recommend these two models to be incorporated and examined in DVMs. Their mortality predictions respond to climate change via tree growth, which is sufficient to capture the adverse effects of water availability and competition on the mortality probability of beech under current conditions.},

A random-effects meta-analysis examined the impact of dissociation on psychotherapy outcome in PTSD (pre-registered at Prospero CRD42018086575). Twenty-one trials (of which nine were randomised controlled trials) with 1714 patients were included. Pre-treatment dissociation was not related to treatment effectiveness in patients with PTSD (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.04, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.13). Between-study heterogeneity was high but was not explained by moderators such as trauma focus of the psychotherapy or risk of bias score. There was no indication for publication bias. We found no evidence that dissociation moderates the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. The quality of some of the included studies was relatively low, emphasising the need for high-quality clinical trials in patients with PTSD. The results suggest that pre-treatment dissociation does not determine psychotherapy outcome in PTSD.},

The evidence-based programme Rehabilitation, Sports and Exercise (RSE) that aims to stimulate an active lifestyle during and after a rehabilitation period in people with a disability and/or chronic disease is prepared for nationwide dissemination. So far, however, little is known about the implementation of a new programme to stimulate physical activity in people with a disability in a rehabilitation setting.

The main process outcomes are: recruitment, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, satisfaction, maintenance and context. The process outcomes are evaluated at different levels (organisational and patient) and different time points. Data collection includes both quantitative (online registration system and questionnaires) and qualitative (focus groups and semi-structured interviews) methods. The nationwide dissemination of an evidence-based programme to stimulate physical activity and sports during and after a rehabilitation period is extensively monitored and evaluated on different levels (organization and patients) using mixed methods. The study will contribute to the science of translating evidence-based programmes into daily practice of the rehabilitation care. The results of the study can be used to further optimize the content of the RSE programme and to facilitate the implementation in other health facilities. Furthermore, the results of the study can help future implementation processes in the rehabilitation setting. The study is registered by The Netherlands National Trial Register: NTR3961.},

  abstract = {This study was designed to determine the effect of 2 different potassium regulation strategies with different targets (within the reference range) on atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) in a cohort of intensive care unit patients after cardiac surgery. The GRIP-COMPASS study was a prospective double-blinded interventional study in 910 patients after cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valvular surgery). Patients were assigned to either the normal-low potassium target (nLP group, 4.0 mmol/L) or the normal-high potassium target (nHP group, 4.5 mmol/L) in alternating blocks of 50 patients. Potassium levels were regulated using a validated computer-assisted potassium replacement protocol (GRIP-II). The primary end point was the incidence of AF/AFL on a 12-lead electrocardiogram during the first postoperative week. Of the 910 patients, 447 were assigned to the nLP group; and 463, to the nHP group, with no baseline differences between the 2 groups. The mean daily administered dose of potassium was 30 ± 23 mmol (nLP) versus 52 ± 27 mmol (nHP) (P < .001), which resulted in mean intensive care unit potassium concentration of 4.22 ± 0.36 mmol/L and 4.33 ± 0.34 mmol/L, respectively (P < .001). The incidence of AF/AFL after cardiac surgery did not differ: 38% in the nLP group and 41% in the nHP group. Also in several subgroups (eg, patients not known with prior AF/AFL or with valve surgery), there were no differences. There were no differences in incidence of AF/AFL with 2 potassium regulation strategies with different potassium targets and different amounts of potassium administered in patients after cardiac surgery.},

The current implementation status of a sports and physical activity stimulation programme in 12 rehabilitation centres and 5 hospitals with a rehabilitation department was described by scoring fidelity and satisfaction. Seventy-one rehabilitation professionals filled out a questionnaire on how sports and physical activity, including stimulation activities, were implemented into rehabilitation care. Total fidelity scores (in %) were calculated for each organization. Professionals' satisfaction was rated on a scale from 1 to 10. In most organizations sports and physical activity were to some extent integrated during and after rehabilitation (fidelity scores: median = 54%, IQR = 23%). Physical activity stimulation was not always embedded as standard component of a rehabilitation treatment. Professionals' satisfaction rated a median value of 8.0 (IQR = 0.0) indicating high satisfaction rates. The fidelity outcome showed that activities to stimulate sports and physical activity during and after rehabilitation were integrated into rehabilitation care, but not always delivered as standardized component. These findings have emphasized the importance to focus on integrating these activities into routines of organizations. Implications for Rehabilitation Components of an evidence-based programme to stimulate sports and physical activity during and after rehabilitation can be used to measure the current status of the integration of sports and physical activity in rehabilitation care in a structural and effective way. The method described in the current study can be used to compare the content of the rehabilitation care regarding the integration of sports and physical activity among organizations both on a national and international level. Sports and physical activity are seen as important ingredients for successful rehabilitation care in The Netherlands.},

Organizations were supported in the implementation process by the programme coordinators. Commonly perceived facilitating factors were: involvement of committed and enthusiastic professionals; agreement with their organizations' vision/wishes; the perceived additional value of the programme; and opportunities to share knowledge and experience with professionals from other organizations. Commonly perceived hampering factors were: uncertainty about continuing the programme; limited flexibility; and lack of support from physicians and therapists to implement the programme. Professionals perceived a heterogeneous set of factors that facilitate and/or hamper the implementation and continuation of a physical activity promotion programme in rehabilitation.

  abstract = {Although the importance of evaluating implementation fidelity is acknowledged, little is known about heterogeneity in fidelity over time. This study aims to generate insight into the heterogeneity in implementation fidelity trajectories of a health promotion program in multidisciplinary settings and the relationship with changes in patients' health behavior. This study used longitudinal data from the nationwide implementation of an evidence-informed physical activity promotion program in Dutch rehabilitation care. Fidelity scores were calculated based on annual surveys filled in by involved professionals (n = ± 70). Higher fidelity scores indicate a more complete implementation of the program's core components. A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on the implementation fidelity scores of 17 organizations at three different time points. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to explore organizational and professional differences between identified trajectories. Regression analyses were conducted to determine differences in patient outcomes. Three trajectories were identified as the following: 'stable high fidelity' (n = 9), 'moderate and improving fidelity' (n = 6), and 'unstable fidelity' (n = 2). The stable high fidelity organizations were generally smaller, started earlier, and implemented the program in a more structured way compared to moderate and improving fidelity organizations. At the implementation period's start and end, support from physicians and physiotherapists, professionals' appreciation, and program compatibility were rated more positively by professionals working in stable high fidelity organizations as compared to the moderate and improving fidelity organizations (p < .05). Qualitative data showed that the stable high fidelity organizations had often an explicit vision and strategy about the implementation of the program. Intriguingly, the trajectories were not associated with patients' self-reported physical activity outcomes (adjusted model β = - 651.6, t(613) = - 1032, p = .303). Differences in organizational-level implementation fidelity trajectories did not result in outcome differences at patient-level. This suggests that an effective implementation fidelity trajectory is contingent on the local organization's conditions. More specifically, achieving stable high implementation fidelity required the management of tensions: realizing a localized change vision, while safeguarding the program's standardized core components and engaging the scarce physicians throughout the process. When scaling up evidence-informed health promotion programs, we propose to tailor the management of implementation tensions to local organizations' starting position, size, and circumstances.

However, creating strong and successful partnerships between researchers and stakeholders is complex. Thus far, an in-depth understanding of how, when and why these research partnerships are successful is lacking. The aim of this study is to evaluate and explain the outcomes and impacts of a national network of researchers and community stakeholders over time in order to gain a better understanding of how, when and why research partnerships are successful (or not). This longitudinal multiple case study will use data from the Canadian Disability Participation Project, a large national network of researchers and community stakeholders working together to enhance community participation among people with physical disabilities. To maximise the impact of research conducted within the Canadian Disability Participation Project network, researchers are supported in developing and implementing knowledge translation plans. The components of the RE-AIM framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) will guide this study. Data will be collected from different perspectives (researchers, stakeholders) using different methods (logs, surveys, timeline interviews) at different time points during the years 2018-2021. A combination of data analysis methods, including network analysis and cluster analysis, will be used to study the RE-AIM components. Qualitative data will be used to supplement the findings and further understand the variation in the RE-AIM components over time and across groups. The outcomes, impacts and processes of conducting and disseminating research together with community stakeholders will be extensively studied. The longitudinal design of this study will provide a unique opportunity to examine research partnerships over time and understand the underlying processes using a variety of innovative research methods (e.g. network analyses, timeline interviews).

  abstract = {Research partnership approaches, in which researchers and stakeholders work together collaboratively on a research project, are an important component of research, knowledge translation, and implementation. Despite their growing use, a comprehensive understanding of the principles, strategies, outcomes, and impacts of different types of research partnerships is lacking. Generating high-quality evidence in this area is challenging due to the breadth and diversity of relevant literature. We established a Coordinated Multicenter Team approach to identify and synthesize the partnership literature and better understand the evidence base. This review protocol outlines an innovative approach to locating, reviewing, and synthesizing the literature on research partnerships. Five reviews pertaining to research partnerships are proposed. The Coordinated Multicenter Team developed a consensus-driven conceptual framework to guide the reviews. First, a review of reviews will comparatively describe and synthesize key domains (principles, strategies, outcomes, and impacts) for different research partnership approaches, within and beyond health (e.g., integrated knowledge translation, participatory action research). After identifying commonly used search terminology, three complementary scoping reviews will describe and synthesize these domains in the health research partnership literature. Finally, an umbrella review will amalgamate and reflect on the collective findings and identify research gaps and future directions. We will develop a collaborative review methodology, comprising search strategy efficiencies, terminology standardization, and the division of screening, extraction, and synthesis to optimize feasibility and literature capture. A series of synthesis and scoping manuscripts will emerge from this Coordinated Multicenter Team approach. Comprehensively describing and differentiating research partnership terminology and its domains will address well-documented gaps in the literature. These efforts will contribute to and improve the quality, conduct, and reporting of research partnership literature. The collaborative review methodology will help identify and establish common terms, leverage efficiencies (e.g., expertise, experience, search and protocol design, resources) and optimize research feasibility and quality. Our approach allows for enhanced scope and inclusivity of all research user groups and domains, thereby contributing uniquely to the literature. This multicenter, efficiency and quality-focused approach may serve to inspire researchers across the globe in addressing similar domain challenges, as exist in this rapidly expanding field.},

An internet-based study was conducted to identify and select relevant documents and websites containing information about the national approach to promote disability sports and physical activities in the Netherlands and Canada. Both governments promote high performance sports in similar ways, but use different strategies to promote recreational sports and physical activities. The Dutch approach is characterized by using time-limited programs focusing on enhancement of sports infrastructure and inter-sector collaboration in which municipalities have key roles. The Canadian government promotes recreational sports in disabled populations by supporting programs via bilateral agreements with provinces and territories. Furthermore, the level of integration of disability sports into mainstream sports differs between countries. The findings of this study may inspire policy makers from different countries to learn from one another's policies in order to optimize national approaches to promote disability sports and PA on all levels. Implications for rehabilitation It is recommended for policy makers of national governments to develop and implement policy programs that promote sports and physical activities among people with disabilities because of its potential impact on functioning, participation, quality of life, and health. Insight into national approaches to promote sport and physical activities is relevant for rehabilitation practice to understand ongoing opportunities for people with disabilities to stay physically active after rehabilitation through participation in home and/or community-based sport and physical activities. It seems worthwhile to integrate activities to promote sport and physical activities in rehabilitation in such a way that it fits with the current governmental approach. It is recommended to set up international collaborations to develop and share knowledge about effective and sustainable national approaches to promote sports and physical activities among people with disabilities.},

This study aimed to identify the principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts reported in different types of reviews of research partnerships in order to obtain a better understanding of the scope of the research partnership literature. This review of reviews is part of a Coordinated Multicenter Team approach to synthesise the research partnership literature with five conceptually linked literature reviews. The main research question was 'What principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts are reported in different types of research partnership approaches?'. We included articles describing a literature review of research partnerships using a systematic search strategy. We used an adapted version of the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool to assess quality. Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to April 2018. Principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts were extracted from the included reviews and analysed using direct content analysis. We included 86 reviews using terms describing several research partnership approaches (e.g. community-based participatory research, participatory research, integrated knowledge translation). After the analyses, we synthesised 17 overarching principles and 11 overarching strategies and grouped them into one of the following subcategories: relationship between partners; co-production of knowledge; meaningful stakeholder engagement; capacity-building, support and resources; communication process; and ethical issues related to the collaborative research activities. Similarly, we synthesised 20 overarching outcomes and impacts on researchers, stakeholders, the community or society, and the research process. This review of reviews is the first that presents overarching principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts of research partnerships. This review is unique in scope as we synthesised literature across multiple research areas, involving different stakeholder groups. Our findings can be used as a first step to guide the initiation and maintenance of research partnerships and to create a classification system of the key domains of research partnerships, which may improve reporting consistency in the research partnership literature.

Pilot tests with end-users were conducted throughout. The panel recommended (1) the two scientific exercise guidelines be combined and presented in a single message titled "The Canadian SCI physical activity guidelines"; (2) development of an online supporting resource, with educational and motivational information presented in "layers" to address the needs and preferences of diverse end-users. The top layer presents and explains the Canadian SCI physical activity guidelines. The deeper layers include information on benefits, overcoming barriers, activity examples, safety tips, and links to existing resources. Interviews with adults with SCI (n = 8) and survey-data from end-users (n = 90) showed that the guidelines and supporting resource were perceived as clear, useful, and appropriate. Using community-engaged methods, the two scientific SCI exercise guidelines were combined into one single physical activity guideline message.

This study aimed to explore and describe SCI researchers' and research users' (RU') experiences with and reasons for conducting and/or disseminating (health) research in partnership in order to gain more insight into potentially ways to build capacity for and foster change to support research partnerships within a health research system. Underpinned by a pragmatic perspective, ten semi-structured timeline interviews were conducted with researchers and RU who have experiences with SCI research partnerships. Interviews focused on experiences in participants' lives that have led them to become a person who conducts and/or disseminates research in partnership. Data were analysed using narrative thematic analysis. We identified three threads from participants' stories: (1) seeing and valuing different perspectives, (2) inspirational role models, and (3) relational and personal aspect of research partnerships. We identified sub-threads related to experiences that participants draw on how they came to be a person who engage in (health) research partnerships, and sub-threads related to participants' reasons for engaging in research partnerships. While most sub-threads were identified from both researchers' and RU' perspectives (eg, partnership successes and failures), some were unique for researchers (morally the right thing to do) or RU (advocating). Using a narrative and pragmatic approach, this study provided a new understanding of SCI researchers' and RU' partnership experiences over time. We found that participants' research partnership experiences and motivations align with components of leadership theories.

These could be used by researchers and research users who want to work in partnership to plan, conduct and/or disseminate their SCI research. The findings informed the development of the new SCI Integrated Knowledge Translation Guiding Principles (www.iktprinciples.com) and will support the implementation of these Principles within the SCI research system.},

  abstract = {Physical activity (PA) counselling research has mainly focused on identifying which behaviour change techniques (BCTs) are delivered by a counsellor. Less is known about how BCTs are received by clients. State Space Grids (SSGs) is a dynamic system method that can be used to study counsellor-client interactions by examining frequencies, durations and sequences of BCT delivery and receipt. In this methods paper, we show how SSG methods can be pragmatically used to characterize counsellor-client interactions during a PA behavioural support intervention for adults with disabilities. Methods were demonstrated through a secondary analysis of data from adults with spinal cord injury (age: 45.79 ± 13.63; females: n = 5; males: n = 9) who received PA counselling. Transcripts of 30 audio-recorded counselling sessions (total duration: ∼8.3 h) were double-coded for BCT delivery and receipt statements using a reliable coding method (>84% agreement) and analyzed in two different ways using SSGs methods. Applying the SSG analyses to our data demonstrated that frequencies, durations, and sequences of BCT delivery and receipt varied largely within and between dyads. Across all sessions, the counsellor and client spent on average 32-34% of their time on talking about BCTs related to goals and planning, ∼29% of their time talking about other BCTs (e.g., self-belief, support strategies), and the remaining 27-29% of their time talking about other topics (not BCT-specific). This paper showed how dynamic system methods can be pragmatically used to characterize counsellor-client interactions and illustrate the variability of how BCTs are delivered by a counsellor and received by clients in a PA behavioural support intervention. We demonstrated that SSGs methods can facilitate the examination of frequencies, durations and sequences of BCT delivery and receipt can help advance our understanding of PA behavioural support for adults with and without disabilities.},

  abstract = {Health, fitness and lifestyle professionals can play important roles in promoting physical activity in groups at risk of developing an inactive lifestyle, such as people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Tailored counselling is a promising tool to promote and improve physical activity levels. To support professionals to effectively have a conversation about physical activity with clients with SCI, evidence-based training and resources are needed. This project aimed to (1) co-develop an e-learning course on best practices for SCI physical activity counselling and, (2) examine the effectiveness and usability of this course. Guided by the technology-enhanced learning (TEL) evaluation framework, we used a systematic, multistep approach to co-develop and evaluate an e-learning course. The development process was informed by input and feedback from a diverse group of end-users and experts (n > 160) via online surveys and (think-aloud) interviews. A randomized controlled trial was used to compare learning outcomes (post-knowledge and self-efficacy) between participants who completed the course (intervention group) and the wait-listed control group. Usability, learning experiences, and satisfaction were assessed among all participants. Forty-one participants (21 intervention-group; 20 control-group) with various backgrounds (e.g., lifestyle counsellors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, recreation therapists, fitness trainers) enrolled in the randomized controlled trial. After completing the course, participants in the intervention group showed significantly improved knowledge on the best practices for SCI physical activity counselling and higher self-efficacy for using these best practices in conversations with clients with SCI compared to the control group (p <.001). Participants reported above average usability scores, positive learning experiences, and high levels of satisfaction when completing the course. We used a systematic, multi-step, theory-informed approach to co-develop and evaluate an evidence-based e-learning course on SCI physical activity counselling to support professionals to promote physical activity in their daily practices. The overall positive findings demonstrate that the e-learning course is feasible and ready for further implementation in various health and community settings. Implementation of the e-learning course can help professionals improve the physical activity support they provide to their clients, and subsequently increase physical activity participation in people with SCI.},

One fresh leaflet and a cryopreserved leaflet derived from the same valve were cut into 2 mm diameter pieces and incubated with responder peripheral blood mononuclear cells, matched or mismatched for HLA-DR. The tritiated thymidine incorporation into the lymphocytes measured after 7 days, was expressed as stimulation index. Fresh, HLA-mismatched valve pieces induced high stimulation index in all cases (median 9, range 4 to 117). The cryopreservation procedure resulted in a significantly lower stimulation index (p = 0.002, Wilcoxon), with a median stimulation index of 2 (range 0 to 9). In the instances where HLA-DR matched combinations were studied, cryopreservation was also associated with lower stimulation index. HLA matching itself was able to reduce the stimulation index both with cryopreserved and fresh valve pieces as stimulator, resulting in a median stimulation index of 4 (range 2 to 117) for the HLA-DR-mismatched and 1 (range 0 to 5) for the matched lymphocytes (p = 0.006, Wilcoxon). In conclusion, human cardiac valves are able to stimulate immune competent cells in vitro, even after cryopreservation.

Calcification occurs in almost all transplanted valves, and in children acute valve failure is frequently seen. We hypothesized that failure of the human valve allografts could have an immunologic basis. This hypothesis was tested in a functional way by performing lymphocyte stimulation assays using fresh and cryopreserved valve pieces and endothelial cells derived from valve leaflets as stimulator. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes, both matched and mismatched for HLA antigens, were used as responder cells. The results were expressed as the stimulation index. Fresh valve pieces induced a significantly higher stimulation index (median, 9; range, 4 to 117) compared with the cryopreserved pieces (median, 2; range, 0 to 9; p = 0.002 by Wilcoxon test). The stimulation index was significantly reduced when lymphocytes matched for HLA-DR with the valve pieces were used (median, 1; range, 0 to 5) as compared with the HLA-DR-mismatched combination (median, 4; range, 2 to 117; p = 0.006, Wilcoxon test). Valve leaflet-derived endothelial cells were able to induce a median stimulation index of 8 (range, 3 to 15) when incubated with lymphocytes mismatched for HLA-A, -B, and -DR. In conclusion, stimulation of immune-competent cells in vitro is induced by both fresh and cryopreserved human valve pieces and by endothelial cells derived from fresh valve leaflets. The immune response can be reduced by using cryopreserved valves or by matching valve donor and responder lymphocytes for HLA-DR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of protein synthesis that senses and responds to a variety of stimuli to coordinate cellular metabolism with environmental conditions. To ensure that protein synthesis is inhibited during unfavorable conditions, translation is directly coupled to the sensing of cellular protein homeostasis. Thus, translation is attenuated during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by direct inhibition of the mTORC1 pathway. However, residual mTORC1 activity is maintained during prolonged ER stress, which is thought to be involved in translational reprogramming and adaption to ER stress. By analyzing the dynamics of mTORC1 regulation during ER stress, we unexpectedly found that mTORC1 is transiently activated in cardiomyocytes within minutes at the onset of ER stress before being inhibited during chronic ER stress. This dynamic regulation of mTORC1 appears to be mediated, at least in part, by ATF6, as its activation was sufficient to induce the biphasic control of mTORC1. We further showed that protein synthesis remains dependent on mTORC1 throughout the ER stress response and that mTORC1 activity is essential for posttranscriptional induction of several unfolded protein response genes. Pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 increased cell death during ER stress, indicating that the mTORC1 pathway serves adaptive functions during ER stress in cardiomyocytes potentially by controlling the expression of protective unfolded protein response genes.},

We report the case of an infant with multiple cardiac rhabdomyomas who developed severe refractory supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that was successfully treated with everolimus. Pharmacological mTOR inhibition rapidly improved arrhythmia within few weeks after treatment initiation and correlated with a reduction in tumor size. Intermediate attempts to discontinue everolimus resulted in rhabdomyoma size rebound and recurrence of arrhythmic episodes, which resolved on resumption of therapy. While everolimus treatment led to successful control of arrhythmia in the first years of life, episodes of SVT reoccurred at the age of 6 years. Electrophysiologic testing confirmed an accessory pathway that was successfully ablated, resulting in freedom of arrhythmic events. In summary we present an in-depth evaluation of the long-term use of everolimus in a child with TSC-associated SVT, including the correlation between drug use and arrhythmia outcome. This case report provides important information on the safety and efficacy of an mTOR inhibitor for the treatment of a potentially life-threatening cardiac disease manifestation in TSC for which the optimal treatment strategy is still not well established.},

The UPR is thought to increase ER protein folding capacity and maintain proteostasis. ATF6 deficiency during pressure overload leads to heart failure, suggesting that ATF6 protects against myocardial dysfunction by preventing protein misfolding. However, conclusive evidence that ATF6 prevents toxic protein misfolding during cardiac hypertrophy is still pending. Here, we found that activation of the UPR, including ATF6, is a common response to pathological cardiac hypertrophy in mice. ATF6 KO mice failed to induce sufficient levels of UPR target genes in response to chronic isoproterenol infusion or transverse aortic constriction (TAC), resulting in impaired cardiac growth. To investigate the effects of ATF6 on protein folding, the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins as well as soluble amyloid oligomers were directly quantified in hypertrophied hearts of WT and ATF6 KO mice. Whereas only low levels of protein misfolding was observed in WT hearts after TAC, ATF6 KO mice accumulated increased quantities of misfolded protein, which was associated with impaired myocardial function. Collectively, the data suggest that ATF6 plays a critical adaptive role during cardiac hypertrophy by protecting against protein misfolding.},

It is largely unknown how regulation of mRNA translation contributes to cardiac gene expression and inflammation in response to reperfusion and whether it can be targeted to mitigate I/R injury. To examine translation and its impact on gene expression in response to I/R, we measured protein synthesis after reperfusion in vitro and in vivo. Underlying mechanisms of translational control were examined by pharmacological and genetic targeting of translation initiation in mice. Cell type-specific ribosome profiling was performed in mice that had been subjected to I/R to determine the impact of mRNA translation on the regulation of gene expression in cardiomyocytes. Translational regulation of inflammation was studied by quantification of immune cell infiltration, inflammatory gene expression, and cardiac function after short-term inhibition of translation initiation. Reperfusion induced a rapid recovery of translational activity that exceeds baseline levels in the infarct and border zone and is mediated by translation initiation through the mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1)-4EBP1 (eIF4E-binding protein 1)-eIF (eukaryotic initiation factor) 4F axis. Cardiomyocyte-specific ribosome profiling identified that I/R increased translation of mRNA networks associated with cardiac inflammation and cell infiltration. Short-term inhibition of the mTORC1-4EBP1-eIF4F axis decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as Ccl2 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2) of border zone cardiomyocytes, thereby attenuating Ly6C Global protein synthesis is inhibited during ischemia and shortly after reperfusion, followed by a recovery of protein synthesis that exceeds baseline levels in the border and infarct zones. Activation of mRNA translation after reperfusion is driven by mTORC1/eIF4F-mediated regulation of initiation and mediates an mRNA network that controls inflammation and monocyte infiltration to the myocardium. Transient inhibition of the mTORC1-/eIF4F axis inhibits translation and attenuates Ly6C},

In this paper, the effects of the model changes in SimpleBox 4.0 on the predicted steady-state concentrations of chemical substances were explored for different substance groups (neutral organic substances, acids, bases, metals) in a standard emission scenario. In general, the largest differences between the predicted concentrations in the new and the old model are caused by the implementation of layered ocean compartments.

Multiple diffusion measures were calculated using streamline tractography, and correlations with DMN functional connectivity were determined. Diabetic patients showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (a measure of white matter integrity) in the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus. Control subjects showed stronger functional connectivity than patients between the posterior cingulate and both left fusiform and medial frontal gyri. FA of the cingulum bundle was correlated with functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus for combined groups. Thus, middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes show white matter abnormalities that correlate with disrupted functional connectivity in the DMN, suggesting that common mechanisms may underlie structural and functional connectivity. Detecting brain abnormalities in middle age enables implementation of therapies to slow progression of neuropathology.},

Tacit knowledge seems to play an important role, but little is known about its nature, including what is necessary for its development and transfer. To gain understanding of the nature and development of tacit knowledge between persons with PIMD and their caregivers. We conducted an interpretative synthesis of literature on tacit knowledge in caregiving dyads with persons with PIMD, persons with dementia or infants. Twelve studies were included. Tacit knowledge is about caregivers and care-recipients becoming sensitive and responsive to each other's cues and together crafting care routines. Learning takes place in a constant process of action and response that transforms those involved. Building tacit knowledge together is necessary for persons with PIMD to learn to recognise and express their needs. Suggestions are made for ways to facilitate its development and transfer.},

Specifically, we propose EBEPs may often be best understood as morally motivated behaviors grounded in people's moral values and perceptions of moral violations. As evidence, we report five studies that integrate spatial modeling and experimental methods to investigate the relationship between moral values and EBEPs. Our results, from these U.S. based studies, suggest that moral values oriented around group preservation are predictive of the county-level prevalence of hate groups and associated with the belief that extreme behavioral expressions of prejudice against marginalized groups are justified. Additional analyses suggest that the association between group-based moral values and EBEPs against outgroups can be partly explained by the belief that these groups have done something morally wrong.},

Studies included were published articles containing (1) primary research investigating the psychometric and clinimetrics of the PSFS or (2) the implementation of the PSFS as an outcome measure. We assessed the methodological quality of studies included in the first category. Two hundred forty-two articles published from 1994 to May 2010 were identified. Of these, 66 met the inclusion criteria for this review, with 13 reporting the measurement properties of the PSFS, 55 implementing the PSFS as an outcome measure, and 2 doing both of the above. The PSFS was reported to be valid, reliable, and responsive in populations with knee dysfunction, cervical radiculopathy, acute low back pain, mechanical low back pain, and neck dysfunction. The PSFS was found to be reliable and responsive in populations with chronic low back pain. The PSFS was also reported to be valid, reliable, or responsive in individuals with a limited number of acute, subacute, and chronic conditions. This review found that the PSFS is also being used as an outcome measure in many other conditions, despite a lack of published evidence supporting its validity in these conditions. Although the use of the PSFS as an outcome measure is increasing in physiotherapy practice, there are gaps in the research literature regarding its validity, reliability, and responsiveness in many health conditions.},

We have performed a detailed UV/vis spectroscopic study of the recovery of the signaling state of wild type (WT) PYP and two mutants, H108F and Δ25-PYP, derived from this protein, as a function of pH and the concentration of citric acid. This revealed that it is the dianionic form of citric acid that binds to the pB state of PYP. Its binding site is located in between the N-terminal cap and central β-sheet of PYP, which is accessible only in the signaling state of the protein. The obtained results show how changes in the distribution of subspecies of the signaling state of PYP influence the rate of ground state recovery.},

Secondly, as an explorative analysis, we investigated if differences in gain prescription verified with real-ear measurements explain differences in self-reported outcomes. The study was designed as a randomized controlled trial in which the patients were blinded towards the purpose of the study. In total, 190 first-time hearing aid users (>60 years of age) with symmetric bilateral presbycusis were fitted with either a premium or basic hearing aid. The randomization was stratified on age, sex, and word recognition score. Two outcome questionnaires were distributed: the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) and the short form of the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ-12). In addition, insertion gains were calculated from real-ear measurements at first-fit for all fitted hearing aids. Premium hearing aid users reported 0.7 (95%CI: 0.2; 1.1) scale points higher total SSQ-12 score per item and 0.8 (95%CI: 0.2; 1.4) scale points higher speech score per item, as well as 0.6 (95%CI: 0.2; 1.1) scale points higher qualities score compared to basic-feature hearing aid users. No significant differences in reported hearing aid effectiveness were found using the IOI-HA. Differences in the prescribed gain at 1 and 2 kHz were observed between premium and basic hearing aids within each company. Premium-feature devices yielded slightly better self-reported hearing abilities than basic-feature devices, but a statistically significant difference was only found in three out of seven outcome variables, and the effect was small. The generalizability of the study is limited to community-dwelling older adults with presbycusis. Thus, further research is needed for understanding the potential effects of hearing aid technology for other populations. Hearing care providers should continue to insist on research to support the choice of more costly premium technologies when prescribing hearing aids for older adults with presbycusis. },

Pure-tone audiometry, AR thresholds, and responses to the abbreviated version of the Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale (SSQ12) and the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) questionnaire were obtained, along with information about previous occupational noise exposure. Greater occupational noise exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of steeply sloping audiograms in men and women and a 0.32 (95% CI: -0.57; -0.06) scale points lower mean SSQ12 total score among noise-exposed men. AR thresholds did not show a significant relation to noise-exposure status, but hearing thresholds at a given frequency were related to elevated AR thresholds at the same frequency. A noise exposure history is linked to steeper audiograms in older adults with hearing loss as well as to poorer self-reported hearing abilities in noise-exposed men. More attention to older adults with previous noise exposure is warranted in hearing rehabilitation.},

X-linked and autosomal forms are sometimes clinically indistinguishable. For genetic counseling in families, it is therefore important to know the gene involved. In 24 of 42 unrelated patients with features of HED, we found a mutation in ED1. ED1-negative patients were screened for mutations in EDAR and EDARADD. We found mutations in EDAR in 5 of these 18 patients. One mutation, p.Glu354X, is novel. In EDARADD, a novel variant p.Ser93Phe, probably a neutral polymorphism, was also found. Clinically, there was a difference between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive HED patients. The phenotype in patients with mutations in both EDAR alleles was comparable to males with X-linked HED. Patients with autosomal dominant HED had features comparable to those of female carriers of X-linked HED. The teeth of these patients were quite severely affected. Hypohidrosis and sparse hair were also evident, but less severe. This study confirms Chassaing et al's earlier finding that mutations in EDAR account for approximately 25% of non-ED1-related HED. Mutations leading to a premature stop codon have a recessive effect except when the stop codon is in the last exon. Heterozygous missense mutations in the functional domains of the gene may have a dominant-negative effect with much variation in expression. Patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the EDAR gene have a more severe phenotype than those with a heterozygous missense, nonsense or frame-shift mutation.},

Given that many MDD patients show psychomotor retardation, we aim to examine whether the left motor cortex (lMC) as a novel rTMS target would provide effective and well-tolerated treatment as being comparable to lDLPFC-rTMS. In this prospective double-blind randomized single-center study, 131 MDD patients were randomly assigned to the lDLPFC or lMC group and were treated with 10 Hz rTMS (90 % motor threshold) applied twice daily for 4000 pulses continuously over five days. The primary endpoint was the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) total score change after treatment. After the five-day rTMS treatment, there was no significant difference in both HAMD reduction rate (lDLPFC 59.3 % ± 20.4 %, lMC 51.3 % ± 26.3 %, P = 0.10) and adverse effects (P = 0.79) between 48 (73.8 %) lMC subjects and 51 (77.3 %) lDLPFC subjects. Furthermore, the lMC study group showed stable HAMD scores at follow-up compared to their endpoint scores (P = 0.08). Sham-control group was not included and the sample size was small. Therefore, our results should be seen as exploratory and preliminary. The preliminary good therapeutic response, comparability, and tolerability of lMC-rTMS suggest lMC a potential and more easily accessible rTMS target. Together, our findings raise the possibility of symptom-specific rTMS in motor cortex (psychomotor retardation) or lDLPFC (cognitive deficits). This warrants larger clinical trials of rTMS in MDD with symptom-specific stimulation targets.},

Since the local impacts are neither well quantified nor widely recognized, we lack policies and common practices to mitigate the potential associated welfare loss in affected communities. Based on a nationwide dataset combining property transactions and large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSSPV) sites, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of LSSPV on property prices and the associated causal pathways. Difference-in-differences estimates show that LSSPV significantly increases agricultural or vacant land value by about 19.4% within a 2-mile radius, while simultaneously reducing residential property values within 3 miles by about 4.8%. The estimated average negative impact on home values is primarily driven by site proximity and diminishes with both distance and time. Effect estimates are more robust to alternative specifications when proximity pairs with visibility rather than invisibility, but no evidence suggests visibility significantly amplifies the proximity effect. Heterogeneous effect estimates indicate that high solar lease potential, being in heavily Democratic-leaning counties, and brownfield redevelopment largely mitigate the negative residential value impact. The analysis reveals no significant heterogeneity across a few factors, including varying site visibility, directional orientation of properties relative to the LSSPV site, and different tracking systems. Evidence indicates that the negative impact on residential values might mainly stem from negative perceptions, but channels through physical conditions cannot be entirely dismissed. Our assessment provides benchmark information for local externality mitigation plans, potentially reducing community opposition and expediting the renewable energy transition.},

Researchers have been evaluating agricultural production choices along both the extensive and intensive margins to improve ecosystem services. This study uses the US Department of Agriculture's Regional Environment and Agriculture Programming (REAP) model, a partial equilibrium simulation model that integrates agricultural production, land use, and environmental outcomes, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a Yield Reserve Program compared to an expansion of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) on revenues, costs, output, and potential reductions in N loads from the production of 10 major crops, both nationally and regionally. The findings indicate that the Yield Reserve Program outperforms the CRP in terms of achieving N reduction under equivalent government budget expenditures. However, the N reduction under the Yield Reserve Program is partially offset by the "rebound effect" on corn (Zea mays L.) acreage whereby corn acreage increases with the subsidized N reduction. The CRP expansion demonstrates a strong "slippage effect," where the expansion of CRP acreage simply brings marginal land into crop production resulting in a smaller-than-expected N reduction. Sensitivity analysis shows that higher percentage of Yield Reserve in terms of the amount of subsidized N reduction tends to be more cost-effective, and more inelastic land supply tends to reduce the "slippage" of CRP expansion.},

At some points, our thoughts are related to external stimuli or tasks focusing on single content (on-single thoughts), While in other moments, they are drifting away with multiple simultaneous items as contents (off-multiple thoughts). Can such thought dynamics be tracked by corresponding neurodynamics? To address this question, here we track thought dynamics during post-stimulus periods by electroencephalogram (EEG) neurodynamics of alpha and theta peak frequency which, as based on the phase angle, must be distinguished from non-phase-based alpha and theta power. We show how, on the psychological level, on-off thoughts are highly predictive of single-multiple thought contents, respectively. Using EEG, on-single and off-multiple thoughts are mediated by opposite changes in the time courses of alpha (high in on-single but low in off-multiple thoughts) and theta (low in on-single but high in off-multiple thoughts) peak frequencies. In contrast, they cannot be distinguished by frequency power. Overall, these findings provide insight into how alpha and theta peak frequency with their phase-related processes track on- and off-thoughts dynamically. In short, neurodynamics track thought dynamics.},

Here, we found that neither structural changes nor subtle differences in the E2-E3 interaction surface are possible explanations for the functional specificity of UbcH5B and UbcH7 in their interaction with c-Cbl. The quick transfer of ubiquitin from the UbcH5B-Ub thioester to c-Cbl or other ubiquitin acceptors suggests that UbcH5B might functionally be a relatively pliable E2 enzyme. In contrast, the UbcH7-Ub thioester is too stable to transfer ubiquitin under our assay conditions, indicating that UbcH7 might be a more specific E2 enzyme. Our results imply that the interaction specificity between c-Cbl and E2 is required but not sufficient for transfer of ubiquitin to potential targets.},

RING domains are involved in specific interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and thus play an essential role in the ubiquitination pathway. Protein production of the Zn(2+) containing and cysteine rich RING domains for molecular studies frequently turns out to be problematic. We compared the expression and solubility of 14 E3 RING/U-box domains fused to the N-terminal tags of His(6), His(6)-GB1, His(6)-Trx and His(6)-GST at small scale and analyzed, by NMR spectroscopy, their correct folding after purification. The addition of GST, Trx or GB1 to the N-terminal His(6) tag significantly improved both the expression and solubility of target proteins as compared to His(6) tag alone. More importantly most of the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purified proteins were largely unfolded as judged by analysis of the (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra. We demonstrate that imidazole causes a concentration dependent decrease in stability of RING proteins ascribed to metal depletion and resulting in unfolding or precipitation. In contrast, using glutathione affinity chromatography, the His(6)-GST fused RING and U-box domains were purified as correctly folded proteins with high yields. Our data clearly demonstrate that IMAC should be avoided and that GST-fusion affinity chromatography is generally applicable for expression and purification of Zn(2+) containing proteins.},

Using NMR spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the Rad6b binding site, for the Rad18 RING domain, strongly resembles that of other E2/E3 RING/U-box complexes. We show that the homodimeric Rad18 RING domain can recruit two Rad6b E2 enzymes, whereas the full-length Rad18 homodimer binds only to a single Rad6b molecule. Such asymmetry is a common feature of RING-RING heterodimers and has been observed for the CHIP U-box homodimer. We propose that asymmetry may be a common feature of dimeric RING E3 ligases.},

In acute normovolemic haemodilution autologous unfractionated heparinised blood is stored ex-vivo and retransfused at the end of the procedure to reduce (allogeneic) transfusion requirements. In this observational study we assessed whether platelet function is better preserved in ex vivo stored autologous blood compared to platelet function in the patient during CPB. We measured platelet aggregation responses pre-CPB, 5 min after the start of CPB, at the end of CPB, and after unfractionated heparin reversal, using multiple electrode aggregometry (Multiplate®) with adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) and ristocetin activated test cells. We compared blood samples taken from the patient with samples taken from 100 ml ex-vivo stored blood, which we took to mimick blood storage during normovolemic haemodilution. Platelet function declined both in ex-vivo stored blood as well as in blood taken from the patient. At the end of CPB there were no differences in platelet aggregation responses between samples from the ex vivo stored blood and the patient. Ex vivo preservation of autologous blood in unfractionated heparin does not seem to be profitable to preserve platelet function.},

We compared the preservation of platelet function and the quality of anticoagulation in autologous blood of 26 cardiac surgical patients collected intraoperatively and anticoagulated ex vivo with either bivalirudin or heparin, with supplementation of bivalirudin over time and prevention of stasis. We found in both preservatives a reduction in ADP-induced platelet aggregation response over a period of 105 minutes (median, IQR: 73-141) as measured by Multiplate®. Supplementation of additional bivalirudin (23 ± 1.1 μg/ml/hr) and prevention of stasis was not able to prevent thrombin generation. We found a 5-fold increase in levels of prothrombin fragment 1+2 in bivalirudin preserved autologous blood as compared to heparin preserved blood (F(1+2) levels median 8.9 nM [quartile percentiles 4.2-12.4] vs 1.3 nM [0.6-2.1], P=0.001 Mann-Whitney, n=10).

A pilot intervention (n=53) based on SR-principles consisted of a motivational interview, group sessions and a workbook and was evaluated against standard care with (n=38) and without a self-help manual (n=38). Subjects were overweight (BMI>27) patients with type 2 diabetes (52% female) from a Dutch hospital (mean age 58.14, S.D.=8.86). No differences in the outcomes were found between the intervention and control groups at 3 (T2) or 6 (T3) months. However, results at T2 and T3 revealed that patients with higher SR-skills scores had lower HbA1c levels than patients with lower scores. The SR-intervention did not significantly influence the outcomes. This apparent lack of effect might, however, partly be due to high attrition rates in all treatment groups. SR-skills were positively related to changes in HbA1c-levels. Improving SR-skills of overweight diabetes type 2 patients may improve their glycemic control. Patients who are 'external regulators' may however profit more from directive than from SR-interventions.},

A clinical trial was conducted with 101 overweight/obese (body mass index >27) diabetes type 2 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to a self-regulation intervention, an active control group, and a passive control group. Psychological, somatic, socio-demographic, and lifestyle variables were examined as predictors of drop-out from baseline to 6 months follow-up. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that low autonomous regulation or low 'goal ownership' was the best predictor of drop-out.

Patients who score low on 'goal ownership' may be offered pretreatment interventions to increase their motivation.},

We performed an international, interdisciplinary study on 51 individuals with SMC1A variants for physical and behavioral characteristics, and compare results to those in 67 individuals with NIPBL variants. For the Netherlands all known individuals with SMC1A variants were studied, both with and without CdLS phenotype. Individuals with SMC1A variants can resemble CdLS, but manifestations are less marked compared to individuals with NIPBL variants: growth is less disturbed, facial signs are less marked (except for periocular signs and thin upper vermillion), there are no major limb anomalies, and they have a higher level of cognitive and adaptive functioning. Self-injurious behavior is more frequent and more severe in the NIPBL group. In the Dutch group 5 of 13 individuals (all females) had a phenotype that shows a remarkable resemblance to Rett syndrome: epileptic encephalopathy, severe or profound intellectual disability, stereotypic movements, and (in some) regression. Their missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations are evenly spread over the gene. We conclude that SMC1A variants can result in a phenotype resembling CdLS and a phenotype resembling Rett syndrome. Resemblances between the SMC1A group and the NIPBL group suggest that a disturbed cohesin function contributes to the phenotype, but differences between these groups may also be explained by other underlying mechanisms such as moonlighting of the cohesin genes.},

In this review on SIB phenomenology in people with ID in general and in twelve genetic syndromes, we summarize different SIB characteristics across these etiologically distinct entities and identify influencing factors. We demonstrate that the prevalence of SIB in several well-known genetic intellectual disability syndromes is noticeably higher than in individuals with ID in general, and that characteristics such as age of onset and topographies differ widely across syndromes. Each syndrome is caused by a mutation in a different gene, and this allows detection of several pathways that lead to SIB. Studying these with the behavioral consequences as specific aim will be an important step toward targeted early interventions and prevention.},

The presence of disease exacerbates this further, increasing the need for an automated solution. To this extent, SynthSeg is a robust deep learning model designed for automatic brain segmentation across various contrasts and resolutions. This study validates the SynthSeg robust brain segmentation model on computed tomography (CT), using a multi-center dataset. An open access dataset of 260 paired CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from radiotherapy patients treated in 5 centers was collected. Brain segmentations from CT and MRI were obtained with SynthSeg model, a component of the Freesurfer imaging suite. These segmentations were compared and evaluated using Dice scores and Hausdorff 95 distance (HD95), treating MRI-based segmentations as the ground truth. Brain regions that failed to meet performance criteria were excluded based on automated quality control (QC) scores. Dice scores indicate a median overlap of 0.76 (IQR: 0.65-0.83). The mean volume difference is 7.79% (CI: 6.41%-9.18%), with CT segmentations typically smaller than MRI-based. The median HD95 is 2.95 mm (IQR: 1.73-5.39). QC score based thresholding improves median dice by 0.1 and median HD95 by 0.05 mm. Morphological differences related to sex and age, as detected by MRI, were also replicated with CT, with an approximate 17% difference between the CT and MRI results for sex and 10% difference between the results for age. SynthSeg can be utilized for CT-based automatic brain segmentation, but only in applications where precision is not essential. CT performance is lower than MRI based on the integrated QC scores, but low-quality segmentations can be excluded with QC-based thresholding. Additionally, performing CT-based neuroanatomical studies is encouraged, as the results show correlations in sex- and age-based analyses similar to those found with MRI.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, almost half of all heart transplantation candidates arrive today at their transplant operation with durable continuous-flow mechanical circulatory support (CF-MCS). This evolution is due to a progressive increase of waiting list time and hence an increased risk of haemodynamic worsening. Longer duration of CF-MCS is associated with a higher risk of device-related complications with potential adverse impact on post-transplant outcome as suggested by recent results from the United Network of Organ Sharing of the United States. A 2-centre Swiss heart transplantation programme conducted a retrospective observational study of consecutive patients of theirs who underwent a transplant in the period 2008-2020. The primary aim was to determine whether post-transplant all-cause mortality is different between heart transplant recipients without or with pre-transplant CF-MCS. The secondary outcome was the acute cellular rejection score within the first year post-transplant. The study participants had a median age of 54 years; 38/158 (24%) were females. 53/158 study participants (34%) had pre-transplant CF-MCS with a median treatment duration of 280 days. In heart transplant recipients with pre-transplant CF-MCS, the prevalence of ischaemic cardiomyopathy was higher (51 vs 32%; p = 0.013), the left ventricular ejection fraction was lower (20 vs 25; p = 0.047) and pulmonary vascular resistance was higher (2.3 vs 2.1 Wood Units; p = 0.047). Over the study period, the proportion of heart transplant recipients with pre-transplant CF-MCS and the duration of pre-transplant CF-MCS treatment increased (2008-2014 vs 2015-2020: 22% vs 45%, p = 0.009; increase of treatment days per year: 34.4 ± 11.2 days, p = 0.003; respectively). The primary and secondary outcomes were not different between heart transplant recipients with pre-transplant CF-MCS or direct heart transplantation (log-rank p = 0.515; 0.16 vs 0.14, respectively; p = 0.81). This data indicates that the strategy of pre-transplant CF-MCS with subsequent orthotopic heart transplantation provides post-transplant outcomes not different to direct heart transplantation despite the fact that the duration of pre-transplant assist device treatment has progressively increased.},

Therefore, we established and characterized in vitro and in vivo models for ADPGK-deficiency using Jurkat T cells and zebrafish. Upon activation, ADPGK knockout Jurkat T cells displayed increased cell death and ER stress. The increase in cell death resulted from a metabolic catastrophe and knockout cells displayed severely disturbed energy metabolism hindering induction of Warburg phenotype. ADPGK knockdown in zebrafish embryos led to short, dorsalized body axis induced by elevated apoptosis. ADPGK hypomorphic zebrafish further displayed dysfunctional glucose metabolism. In both model systems loss of ADPGK function led to defective N- and O-glycosylation. Overall, our data illustrate that ADPGK is part of a glucose sensing system in the ER modulating metabolism via regulation of N- and O-glycosylation.},

Here, we report the solution structure of the TAF3-PHD finger and its complex with an H3K4me3 peptide. Using a combination of NMR, mutagenesis, and affinity measurements, we reveal the structural basis of binding affinity, methylation-state specificity, and crosstalk with asymmetric dimethylation of R2. A unique local structure rearrangement in the K4me3-binding pocket of TAF3 due to a conserved sequence insertion underscores the requirement for cation-pi interactions by two aromatic residues. Interference by asymmetric dimethylation of arginine 2 suggests that a H3R2/K4 "methyl-methyl" switch in the histone code dynamically regulates TFIID-promoter association.},

Compared to reported CMS frequencies in primary CRC, liver metastases from CRC patients were CMS4-enriched and CMS3-depleted, whereas brain metastases mainly clustered as CMS3 and rarely as CMS4. Regarding overall survival rates, CMS4 was the most favorable subtype for patients with hepatic lesions, followed by CMS1 and CMS2. The survival of patients with brain metastases did not correlate with CMS. However, we identified a CMS3-related metabolic gene signature, specifically upregulated in central nervous system (CNS)-infiltrating CRC, as a negative prognostic marker and potential tumor progressor. In summary, subtyping of CRC metastases revealed an organotropic CMS distribution in liver and brain with impact on patient survival. CNS-infiltrating CRC samples were enriched for CMS3 and predictive metabolic biomarkers, suggesting metabolic dysregulation of CRC cells as a prerequisite for metastatic colonization of the brain.},

We aimed to develop and externally validate a clinical prediction model for older, RCHOP- treated DLBCL patients by examining geriatric assessment and lymphoma-related parameters in real-world cohorts. A population-based training set of 365 R-CHOP-treated DLBCL patients ≥70 years was identified through the Cancer Registry of Norway. The external test set consisted of a population-based cohort of 193 patients. Data on candidate predictors were retrieved from the Cancer Registry and through review of clinical records. Cox regression models for 2-year overall survival were used for model selection. Activities of daily living, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, age, sex, albumin, stage, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and lactate dehydrogenase level were identified as independent predictors and combined into a Geriatric Prognostic Index (GPI). The GPI demonstrated good discrimination (optimismcorrected C-index 0.752), and identified low-, intermediate- and high-risk groups with significantly different survivals (2- year overall survival, 94%, 65%, and 25%, respectively). At external validation, the continuous and grouped GPI demonstrated good discrimination (C-index 0.727 and 0.710, respectively) and the GPI groups had significantly different survivals (2-year overall survival 95%, 65%, and 44%, respectively). Both the continuous and grouped GPI showed better discrimination than the IPI, revised-IPI and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-IPI (C-index 0.621, 0.583, and 0.670, respectively). In conclusion, we have developed and externally validated a GPI for older DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP that outperformed the IPI, revised-IPI and NCCN-IPI.

We sought evidence for the presence and localization of immunoreactive (ir)-ACTH in ovaries from sheep, humans, cows, pigs, rats and cats using immunohistochemical techniques. Tissue sections were stained with diaminobenzidine following incubation with a primary antibody raised against ACTH1-24. There was positive staining for ACTH in cells scattered throughout the interstitium of ovaries from all species examined. Immunoreactive ACTH was observed in the oocytes of ovaries from humans, cows, pigs, pregnant and non-pregnant sheep, but not from cats or rats. Positive staining of oocytes was associated with all tertiary and secondary follicles, and some primary follicles. There was no apparent difference in the pattern of staining between pregnant and non-pregnant sheep. Staining for ir-ACTH was absent in ovaries from fetal sheep. We conclude that ir-ACTH is present in ovarian tissue, and in particular the oocyte, from several species of mammal. The presence of ir-ACTH within the oocyte is dependent on species and stage of follicular maturation.},

A retrospective analysis of intraoperative transesophageal 3-dimensionalechocardiographic MV datasets was performed. A mathematical model was created to assess the mitral CRI for each leaflet segment (A1-P1, A2-P2, A3-P3). Mitral CRI was defined as the ratio between the coaptation reserve (measured coaptation length along the closure line) and an individualized correction factor. Indexing was chosen to correct for MV sphericity and area of largest valve opening. Mathematical models were created to simulate progressive mitral annular dilatation and to predict the effect on the individual mitral CRI. At a single-center academic hospital. Twenty-five patients with normally functioning MVs undergoing cardiac surgery. None. Direct measurement of leaflet coaptation along the closure line showed the lowest amount of coaptation (reserve) near the commissures (A1-P1 0.21 ± 0.05 cm and A3-P3 0.22 ± 0.06 cm), and the highest amount of coaptation (reserve) at region A2 to P2 0.25 ± 0.06 cm. After indexing, the A2-to-P2 region was the area with the lowest CRI in the majority of patients, and also the area with the least resistance to mitral regurgitation (MR) occurrence after simulation of progressive annular dilation. Quantification and indexing of mitral coaptation reserve along the closure line are feasible. Indexing and mathematical simulation of progressive annular dilatation consistently showed that indexed coaptation reserve was lowest in the A2-to-P2 region. These results may explain why this area is prone to lose coaptation and is often affected in MR.},

No other known relatives were affected. Ophthalmic examination and histology, including electron microscopy, were performed. Genetic testing was conducted by means of whole exome sequencing, and variant analysis was achieved by using an internal in silico pipeline. Molecular tests included a dual-luciferase assay. Slowly progressive blurred vision was reported from childhood by the daughter. The father's symptoms started at age 55. Best-corrected visual acuity was reduced in both patients (0.2-0.4). Slit-lamp examination in both patients revealed bilateral corneal clouding with gray endothelial lesions; other family members had no ophthalmological signs. Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty was performed uneventfully in both patients. Histology showed thickened Descemet membrane and abnormal endothelium resembling epithelial-like cells. Both patients carried the OVOL2 5' untranslated region NM_021220.4.c.-61G>A variant in the heterozygous state. This change was associated with increased promoter activity and was not present in the unaffected members of the family. The 5' untranslated region mutation c.-61G>A in OVOL2 has been previously found in 1 individual with PPCD1 and reported as a variant of unknown significance because of insufficient evidence supporting its pathogenicity. Identification of the second family with 2 individuals affected by PPCD1 carrying this change, together with functional data, provides further proofs that it is disease-causing.},

  abstract = {Sporting activities that involve repetitive stress to muscle compartments can elicit chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Its occurrence in the lower leg muscle compartments is most common, but other locations are less well known and the pathophysiology is not completely understood. In motocross racers, chronic exertional compartment syndrome can occur in the muscles of the lower arm. Currently, the only accepted treatment of correctly diagnosed chronic exertional compartment syndrome is surgical release of the fascia, which successfully relieves pain and allows patients to return to full activity. Open decompression is considered as the gold standard of treatment. This clinical paper describes our new endoscopic technique and investigates the functional outcome after surgery. We report on a series of 154 chronic exertional compartment syndromes afflicted motocross racers treated with an endoscopic release of the lower arm muscles. An MRI scan before and after strenuous exercise of the hand flexors (repetitive grip until exhaustion for 15 min) was performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Symptom severity before and after surgery was assessed using a visual analogue scale. Preoperative symptom severity scores were 1.1 ± 0.3 before exercise and 7.4 ± 1.5 after exercise. Post-operatively, these were 1.0 ± 0.2 and 1.7 ± 0.9. The pre- versus post-operative symptom scores after exercise were significantly different (p < 0.0001). No perioperative complications occurred, and at 6 weeks, all of the racers resumed their sportive activities. It can be concluded that endoscopic release of the superficial compartment of the forearms of motocross racers diagnosed with chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a valuable treatment option, with mild post-operative pain and fast recovery.},

Once considered to be a disease of the apocrine glands, it is actually a defect of follicular epithelium. Thus, the term hidradenitis suppurativa is a misnomer and should be abandoned. In cases of familial acne inversa, the pattern of transmission and number of affected individuals are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Aetiological factors such as hyperandrogenism, obesity, smoking and chemical irritants are not consistently associated with the affection. Bacterial involvement is not a primary event in acne inversa, but is secondary to the disease process. Potential complications include dermal contraction, local or systemic infection due to the spread of microorganisms, systemic amyloidosis, arthropathy, and squamous cell carcinoma. As spontaneous resolution is rare and progressive disability is the rule, early definitive surgical intervention is advisable. The surgical procedure of choice in most cases is wide local excision and healing by secondary intention. Pharmacotherapeutic drugs, including synthetic retinoids and antiandrogens, do not prevent progression of the disease.},

In response, research efforts are being devoted to the development of tools that assess the sensitivity of such models to often strong but always, at least in part, unverifiable assumptions. Many efforts have been devoted to longitudinal data, primarily in the selection model context, although some researchers have expressed interest in the pattern-mixture setting as well. A promising tool, proposed by Verbeke et al. (2001, Biometrics 57, 43-50), is based on local influence (Cook, 1986, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 48, 133-169). These authors considered the Diggle and Kenward (1994, Applied Statistics 43, 49-93) model, which is based on a selection model, integrating a linear mixed model for continuous outcomes with logistic regression for dropout. In this article, we show that a similar idea can be developed for multivariate and longitudinal binary data, subject to nonmonotone missingness. We focus on the model proposed by Baker, Rosenberger, and DerSimonian (1992, Statistics in Medicine 11, 643-657). The original model is first extended to allow for (possibly continuous) covariates, whereafter a local influence strategy is developed to support the model-building process. The model is able to deal with nonmonotone missingness but has some limitations as well, stemming from the conditional nature of the model parameters. Some analytical insight is provided into the behavior of the local influence graphs.},

A mini-ethnographic study, using participant observation and ethnographic interviews. Cultural and social factors have a significant influence on the decisions related to childbirth. One of the most important factors identified was that the responsible persons for decisions related to a delivery were the older female relatives, rather than the mothers themselves. Older females used rational judgements to weigh up the possibilities of risks, interests and advantages related to their cultural, spiritual and social system. Other factors were staff behaviour that was characterized as unfriendly and lacking for respect as to the living conditions and thinking of the pregnant women in the village. Ethnographic research provided an understanding of traditional structures that have an influence on the decisions and behaviour of the community related to childbirth. Appreciation of these structures enabled health promotion and structured health services to be delivered in a more culturally appropriate way.},

Twenty-six patients with iRPF receiving tamoxifen monotherapy underwent repeated FDG-PET (baseline and, if positive, at 3 months) and computed tomographic (CT) scanning (baseline, 4 and 8 months). Maximal RPF mass thickness in 3 different view directions was measured on each CT scan; FDG-uptake was semi-quantified using a visual 4-point scale. Initial and follow-up PET scan results were correlated with clinical, laboratory and CT scan follow-up data. Treatment outcome was the aggregate measure of clinical, laboratory and CT-documented response to tamoxifen. FDG-PET was positive in 20 patients. Patients with positive PET scan result had higher C-reactive protein level (P=0.02) and larger mass size (P=0.01) compared with patients with negative PET scan result. Visual PET score correlated with C-reactive protein level (P=0.002) and CT-documented mass thickness (P=0.04). Visual PET score decreased following treatment (P<0.01). This decrease correlated with decrease in ESR (P<0.001) but not with CT-documented mass regression. Positive predicting value (PPV) of initial positive PET scan result was 0.63; PPV of negative follow-up PET scan result in patients with initial positive PET scan result was 0.66. FDG-PET is valuable in detecting (recurrent) disease activity. Short-term follow-up with FDG-PET cannot be routinely recommended for the therapeutic evaluation of RPF disease in tamoxifen-treated patients.},

Programs are patchwork, with variations across provinces in the availability of services, level of public funding, eligibility criteria and out-of-pocket costs borne by residents. Most provinces have cut long-term care bed capacity relative to the senior population in the past decade, without sufficiently expanding home and community care or adequately increasing staffing to reflect the higher acuity of the remaining residents. As a result, care is often rushed and underfunded, with poor working conditions leading to poor quality of care and quality of life for residents. This relationship between workers' and residents' well-being is well documented but poorly addressed. Also well researched but rarely reported are the negative impacts of privatization, at all levels: financing, ownership, management and delivery. This article describes the state of residential long-term care in Canada and proposes three policy directions: creating a pan-Canadian long-term care program, improving quality and reversing privatization.},

For chronic inflammatory diseases, recent guidelines recommend the development of combined malnutrition and inflammation risk scores.

In a prospective cohort study, we examined fifty-five patients with CD in remission (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) <200) at 0 and 6 months. We assessed disease activity (CDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw index), inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), faecal calprotectin (FC)), malnutrition (BMI, subjective global assessment (SGA), serum albumin, handgrip strength), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and administered the newly developed 'Malnutrition Inflammation Risk Tool' (MIRT; containing BMI, unintentional weight loss over 3 months and CRP). All parameters were evaluated regarding their ability to predict disease outcome prospectively at 6 months. At baseline, more than one-third of patients showed elevated inflammatory markers despite clinical remission (36·4 % CRP ≥5 mg/l, 41·5 % FC ≥100 µg/g). Prevalence of malnutrition at baseline according to BMI, SGA and serum albumin was 2-16 %. At 6 months, MIRT significantly predicted outcome in numerous nutritional and clinical parameters (SGA, CD-related flares, hospitalisations and surgeries). In contrast, SGA, handgrip strength, BMI, albumin and body composition had no influence on the clinical course. The newly developed MIRT was found to reliably predict clinical outcome in CD patients. This screening tool might be used to facilitate clinical decision making, including treatment of both inflammation and malnutrition in order to prevent complications.},

Three-dimensional reconstructions have the potential to support the pathologists in visualizing spatial arrangements of structures, which may improve the interpretation of specimen. The aim of this study is to present three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of histology images. En-bloc specimens of transurethral bladder tumour resections were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Specimens were cut into sections of 4 μm and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). With a Phillips IntelliSite UltraFast scanner, glass slides were digitized at 20x magnification. The digital images were aligned by performing rigid and affine image alignment. The tumour and the muscularis propria (MP) were manually delineated to create 3D segmentations. In conjunction with a 3D display, the results were visualized with the Vesalius3D interactive visualization application for a 3D workstation. En-bloc resection was performed in 21 BCa patients. Per case, 26-30 sections were included for the reconstruction into a 3D volume. Five cases were excluded due to export problems, size of the dataset or condition of the tissue block. Qualitative evaluation suggested an accurate registration for 13 out of 16 cases. The segmentations allowed full 3D visualization and evaluation of the spatial relationship of the BCa tumour and the MP. Digital scanning of en-bloc resected specimens allows a full-fledged 3D reconstruction and analysis and has a potential role to support pathologists in the staging of BCa.},

  abstract = {Apart from inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, ADHD in childhood presents with an impairment of motor coordination and balance functions. Until now, literature is scarce about sensorimotor deficits in adult ADHD. This is a pilot study that identifies and quantifies the role of sensory, motor, and central adaptation mechanisms for adult ADHD patients' sensorimotor deficits in a systematic way, using postural control. We analyzed spontaneous and externally perturbed stance in ten adult patients suffering from ADHD. Findings were compared to data from ten matched healthy subjects. Spontaneous sway amplitudes and velocities were larger in ADHD patients compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, body excursions as a function of platform tilts were abnormally large in ADHD patients, specifically in the low frequency range. Based on simple feedback model simulations, we found that ADHD patients showed a larger time delay between platform tilts and body response, and a lower value of the integral part of the neural controller, which affects the long-term control of their posture. These postural abnormalities correlated well with the hyperactivity and impulsivity dimensions of the individual ADHD symptoms. We conclude that adult ADHD patients' major postural deficit consists of an impairment of a stable, long-term sensorimotor behavior, which fits very well to the concept of impulsivity and hyperactivity.},

A fully automated detection and grading network based on deep learning is proposed to enhance reproducibility. A total of 328 transurethral resection specimens from 232 patients were included, and a consensus reading by three specialized pathologists was used. The slides were digitized, and the urothelium was annotated by expert observers. The U-Net-based segmentation network was trained to automatically detect urothelium. This detection was used as input for the classification network. The classification network aimed to grade the tumors according to the World Health Organization grading system adopted in 2004. The automated grading was compared with the consensus and individual grading. The segmentation network resulted in an accurate detection of urothelium. The automated grading shows moderate agreement (κ = 0.48 ± 0.14 SEM) with the consensus reading. The agreement among pathologists ranges between fair (κ = 0.35 ± 0.13 SEM and κ = 0.38 ± 0.11 SEM) and moderate (κ = 0.52 ± 0.13 SEM). The automated classification correctly graded 76% of the low-grade cancers and 71% of the high-grade cancers according to the consensus reading. These results indicate that deep learning can be used for the fully automated detection and grading of urothelial cell carcinoma.},

While previous studies focused on the perspective of supervisor-resident relationships in residents' help-seeking decisions, attention for how the workplace environment and, more specifically, other health care team members influence these decisions is limited. Using a sociocultural lens, this study aimed to explore how residents' decision-making processes to seek help are shaped by their workplace environment. Through a constructivist grounded theory methodology, we purposively and theoretically sampled 18 residents: 9 juniors (postgraduate year 1/2) and 9 seniors (postgraduate year 5/6) at Amsterdam University Medical Centers. Using semi-structured interviews, participating residents' decision-making processes to seek help during patient care delivery were explored. Data collection and analysis were iterative; themes were identified using constant comparative analysis. Residents described their help-seeking decision-making processes as an 'act of performance': they considered how asking for help could potentially impact their assessments. They described this act of performance as the product of an internal 'balancing act' with at its core the non-negotiable priority for providing safe and high-quality patient care. With this in mind, residents weighed up demonstrating the ability to work independently, maintaining credibility and becoming an accepted member of the health care team when deciding to seek help. This 'balancing act' was influenced by sociocultural characteristics of the learning environment, residents' relationships with supervisors and the perceived approachability of other health care team members. This study suggests that sociocultural forces influence residents to experience help-seeking as an act of performance. Especially, a safe learning environment resulting from constructive relationships with supervisors and the approachability of other health care team members lowered the barriers to seek help. Supervisors could address these barriers by having regular conversations with residents about when to seek help.},

It has been suggested, through computational models, that the presence of microcalcifications in the atherosclerotic cap can increase the risk of cap rupture. However, the experimental confirmation of this hypothesis is still lacking. In this study, we have developed a novel tissue-engineered model to mimic the atherosclerotic fibrous cap with microcalcifications and assess the impact of microcalcifications on cap mechanics. First, human carotid plaque caps were analyzed to determine the distribution, size, and density of microcalcifications in real cap tissue. Hydroxyapatite particles with features similar to real cap microcalcifications were used as microcalcification mimics. Injected clusters of hydroxyapatite particles were embedded in a fibrin gel seeded with human myofibroblasts which deposited a native-like collagenous matrix around the particles, during the 21-day culture period. Second harmonic multiphoton microscopy imaging revealed higher local collagen fiber dispersion in regions of hydroxyapatite clusters. Tissue-engineered caps with hydroxyapatite particles demonstrated lower stiffness and ultimate tensile stress than the control group samples under uniaxial tensile loading, suggesting increased rupture risk in atherosclerotic plaques with microcalcifications. This model supports previous computational findings regarding a detrimental role for microcalcifications in cap rupture risk and can further be deployed to elucidate tissue mechanics in pathologies with calcifying soft tissues.},

  abstract = {Understanding residents' workplace learning could be optimized by not only considering attending physicians' role but also the role of nurses. While previous studies described nurses' role during discrete activities (e.g. feedback), a more profound understanding of how nurses contribute to residents' learning remains warranted. Therefore, we used the educational concept of guidance and explored the extent to which residents' and nurses' perceptions align regarding nurses' guiding role and which reasons they provide for their perceptions. This mixed-method study was conducted at four Dutch university medical centres in 2021. We simultaneously collected quantitative and qualitative data from 103 residents and 401 nurses through a theory-informed questionnaire with a Likert-scale and open-ended questions. We analyzed quantitative data to explore respondents' perceptions of nurses' guiding role by using anova. The thematically analyzed qualitative open comments explored respondents' reasons for their perceptions. Nurses indicated to provide significantly more support (p = .01) and guidance on learning from patient care (p < .01) than perceived by residents. Moreover, nurses indicated that attending physicians did not always involve them in guiding residents, whereas residents perceived nurses were being involved (p < .001). Themes suggest that nurses and residents could be divided into two groups: (i) respondents who felt that guiding was inextricably linked to good interprofessional collaboration and patient care and (ii) respondents who saw the guiding role as limited and emphasised the distinct fields of expertise between nurses and physicians. Residents and nurses felt that nurses played an important role in guiding residents' workplace learning. However, some residents did not always perceive to be guided. To further capitalise on nurses' guiding role, we suggest that residents can be encouraged to engage in the learning opportunities nurses provide to achieve optimal team-based patient care.},

  abstract = {The rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque cap overlying a lipid pool and/or necrotic core can lead to thrombotic cardiovascular events. In essence, the rupture of the plaque cap is a mechanical event, which occurs when the local stress exceeds the local tissue strength. However, due to inter- and intra-cap heterogeneity, the resulting ultimate cap strength varies, causing proper assessment of the plaque at risk of rupture to be lacking. Important players involved in tissue strength include the load-bearing collagenous matrix, macrophages, as major promoters of extracellular matrix degradation, and microcalcifications, deposits that can exacerbate local stress, increasing tissue propensity for rupture. This review summarizes the role of these components individually in tissue mechanics, along with the interplay between them. We argue that to be able to improve risk assessment, a better understanding of the effect of these individual components, as well as their reciprocal relationships on cap mechanics, is required. Finally, we discuss potential future steps, including a holistic multidisciplinary approach, multifactorial 3D in vitro model systems, and advancements in imaging techniques. The obtained knowledge will ultimately serve as input to help diagnose, prevent, and treat atherosclerotic cap rupture.},

Vasomotor responses induced by a series of 5-HT agonists and antagonists with some degree of selectivity were studied by using a sensitive in vitro system. Nine 5-HT agonists were examined for contractile effects on the arteries. In cerebral and meningeal arteries 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) was more potent than 5-HT. The opposite order of potency (5-HT-5-CT) was found in temporal arteries. In the cerebral arteries 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOHT) was more potent than sumatriptan while sumatriptan was more potent than 5-MeOHT in meningeal and temporal arteries. The 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, methiothepin, competitively antagonized 5-CT-induced contractions in cerebral arteries, with a pA2 value of 9.05. 5-HT-induced contractions were competitively antagonized by ketanserin (5-HT2) in the temporal arteries pA2 value of 9.06). Methiothepin and ketanserin had non-competitive antagonistic effects in the middle meningeal arteries. The 5-HT3 selective antagonist ondansetron did not cause any shift of the contractions induced by 2-methyl-5-HT in the temporal, cerebral and middle meningeal arteries. These results suggest that the cerebral arteries mainly contain 5-HT1D or 5-HT1-like receptors, and the temporal artery 5-HT2 receptors; the data further indicate the presence of both receptor subtypes in the middle meningeal artery.},

This contraction is blocked by D-myo-inositol-1,2,6-triphosphate (alpha-trinositol). Previous binding studies have shown that alpha-trinositol has no effect at Y1 or Y2 binding sites thus the antagonistic effect should occur at the level of a second messenger. We have examined the effects of NPY on the formation of inositol phosphates (IP) and have looked for an antagonistic effect of alpha-trinositol. NPY (10(-9)-3 x 10-(-7) M) induced strong concentration-dependent contraction of basilar arteries from young guinea-pigs (weight 200-250 g) (Emax: 76.4 +/- 11.1%) but not of arteries from old guinea-pigs (weight > 500 g) (Emax: 2.8 +/- 1.5%). [Pro34]NPY and PYY induced contraction of similar magnitude and potency, whereas NPY13-36 had only a weak effect. This demonstrates an effect via the Y1 type of NPY receptor. The contraction induced by NPY was blocked by alpha-trinositol (p < 0.05). LiCI (2 x 10-4) M), used to inhibit IP breakdown, had no effect on the contraction induced by NPY. NPY (10(-10)-10(-8) M) increased the formation of IP in cerebral vessels from young guinea-pigs from 357 +/- 48 cpm/mg w.w. to 900 +/- 233 cpm/mg w.w. However, there was no alteration in IP formation in cerebral vessels from old guinea-pigs (NPY 10(-9)-10(-7) M). In the presence of alpha-trinositol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) the NPY induced stimulation of IP formation was totally abolished.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

However, these mechanisms are unlikely to play a role in anemia at the start of sepsis. Moreover, sequestration of fluids, renal failure and increase of intravascular space may additionally influence the change in hemoglobin concentration during intravenous fluid administration in the acute phase of sepsis. In this retrospective study, patients who were admitted acutely to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. Patients who fulfilled the international criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock were included in the sepsis group (S-group). The remaining patients were allocated to the control group (C-group). Laboratory data from blood samples taken at first presentation to the hospital and at admission to the ICU, the amount of intravenous fluid administration and length of stay in the emergency department were collected and tested for significant differences between groups. The difference in hemoglobin concentration between the S-group (n = 296) and C-group (n = 320) at first presentation in hospital was not significant (8.8 ± 1.2 versus 8.9 ± 1.2 mmol/l, respectively, p = 0.07). The reduction in hemoglobin concentration from the first presentation at the emergency department to ICU admission was significantly greater in the S-group compared to the C-group (1 [0.5-1.7] versus 0.5 [0.1-1.1] mmol/l, (p < 0.001)). Spearman rho correlation coefficients between the reduction in hemoglobin concentration and the amount of intravenous fluids administered or the creatinine level in the emergency department were significant (0.3 and 0.4, respectively, p < 0.001). In a multivariate regression analysis, creatinine, the amount of fluid administration and the presence of sepsis remained independently associated. Prior to in-hospital intravenous fluid administration, there is no significant difference in hemoglobin concentration between acute septic patients and acutely ill controls. Within several hours after hospital admission, there is a significant reduction in hemoglobin concentration, not only associated with the amount of intravenous fluids administered and the creatinine level, but also independently with sepsis itself.},

We hypothesized that SWE measures would decrease following ultrasound-guided BTX-A injection, and correlate with functional improvement. SWE measures of BTX-A treated muscles were recorded immediately pre-injection, and at 1-, 3- and 6-months post-injection. At the same timepoints, functional assessment was performed using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), and passive and active range of motion (PROM and AROM) measures. Correlation of SWE with MAS, PROM and AROM, as well as the relationship between change in SWE and change in MAS, PROM and AROM was determined using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and generalized estimating equation modeling. 16 muscles were injected and longitudinally assessed. SWE and MAS scores decreased following BTX-A injection (p = 0.030 and 0.004, respectively), reflecting decreased quantitative and qualitative muscle stiffness. Decreased SWE reached statistical significance at 1- and 3-months, and 1-, 3- and 6-months for MAS. When comparing relative change in SWE to relative change in AROM, larger change in SWE strongly correlated with positive change in AROM (p-value range:<0.001-0.057). BTX-A responders also demonstrated lower baseline SWE (1.4 m/s) vs. non-responders (1.9 m/s), p = 0.035. Ultrasound-guided BTX-A injections in patients with USCP resulted in decreased quantitative and qualitative muscle stiffness. Strong correlation between change in SWE and AROM, as well as the significant difference in baseline SWE for BTX-A responders and non-responders, suggests SWE may provide a useful tool to predict and monitor BTX-A response.},

  abstract = {Exogenous insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is known to improve the pathophysiology of a thermal injury, however, deleterious side-effects have limited its utility. Cholesterol-containing cationic liposomes that encapsulate complementary DNA (cDNA) are nonviral carriers used for in vivo gene transfection. We propose that liposome IGF-I gene transfer will accelerate wound healing in burned rats and attenuate deleterious side-effects associated with high levels of IGF-I. To test this hypothesis IGF-I gene constructs, encapsulated in liposomes, were studied for their efficacy in modulating the thermal injury response. Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a 60% TBSA scald burn and randomly divided into three groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the lacZ gene coding for beta-galactosidase, liposomes plus cDNA for IGF-I and beta-galactosidase or liposomes plus the rhIGF-I protein. Body weights and wound healing were measured. Muscle and liver dry/wet weights and IGF-I concentrations in serum, skin and liver were measured by radioimmunoassay. Transfection was confirmed by histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase. Rats receiving the IGF-I cDNA constructs exhibited the most rapid wound re-epithelialization and greatest increase in body weight and gastrocnemius muscle protein content (P < 0.05). Local IGF-I protein concentrations in the skin were higher when compared to liposomes containing only the lacZ gene (P < 0.05) Transfection was apparent in the cytoplasm of myofibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages of the granulation tissue. Liposomes containing the IGF-I gene constructs proved effective in preventing muscle protein wasting and preserving total body weight after a severe thermal injury.},

  abstract = {The effects of exogenous recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) on hepatic acute phase reactant proteins, cytokine expression, and liver morphology were studied in thermally injured rats to define whether rhGH alters the acute phase response. Sprague-Dawley rats (56 males) receiving a 60% TBSA third-degree scald burn were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 2.5 mg/kg/day sc rhGH or saline. Rats were sacrificed on Postburn Days 1, 2, 5, and 7. Serum acute phase reactant proteins and cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 were measured. Hepatocyte proliferation, hepatic cytokine gene expression, and liver protein concentrations were determined. Recombinant hGH increased serum albumin on Days 5 and 7 after burn (P < 0.05). Serum haptoglobin and alpha1-acid glycoprotein levels decreased at 2, 5, and 7 days after burn compared to saline (P < 0.05). In rats treated with rhGH, serum IL-1beta decreased 1 day postburn, while serum TNF-alpha increased 5 days after burn compared to saline (P < 0.05). Serum IL-6 and IL-1alpha did not change. Hepatic RNA levels for TNF-alpha were significantly elevated on Day 1 postburn compared to saline (P < 0. 05). Hepatic protein content increased on Days 2, 5, and 7 postburn compared to saline (P < 0.05). Hepatocyte proliferation in rhGH-treated rats increased on Day 5 after burn (P < 0.05). Data indicate that rhGH alters the hepatic acute phase response by decreasing type I acute phase proteins and modulating IL-1-like cytokine expression. These changes are associated with increased hepatocyte mitosis and serum and total liver protein concentrations.},

  abstract = {Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) are among the most frequent non-pigmented malignancies of the ocular surface. They have a wide range of histological characteristics - ranging from mild epithelial dysplasia to invasive carcinoma of the squamous cells of the cornea. They may be restricted to the conjunctiva or also involve the cornea. As there are no leading symptoms in the early stages, diagnosis may be very delayed in patients who do not receive regular ophthalmological treatment. The present case series describes clinical and histological data on OSSN and includes clinical and histological data on OSSN, including possible clinical presentations, important risk factors, special histological and cytological features and therapeutic options. Retrospective case series of patients with histologically confirmed severe epithelial dysplasia of the conjunctiva and cornea consistent with OSSN who presented to the Department of Ophthalmology in Basel University Hospital. The analysis covered demographic data, symptoms, diagnostic testing (photo documentation, brush biopsy), treatment and cytological and/or histological material and findings. We report on five patients aged between 41 and 92 years at the time of diagnosis. The histological findings in all patients included severe epithelial dysplasia, but with a heterogenous clinical presentation. In all cases, the lesion started in the conjunctiva, but traversed the limbus and extended to the cornea. The primary treatment was always surgical removal. In one patient, this had to be repeated several times due to recurrent metaplasia and was complemented by subsequent mitomycin C therapy. The clinical outcome ranged between total restitution of the original state to inevitable enucleation. The clinical presentation of OSSN is highly heterogenous, so that the initial diagnosis is difficult. There are no official guidelines for treatment, so that the treatment of choice varied between clinics. Regular ophthalmological follow-ups are recommended, even after complete surgical excision. Possible relevant concomitant diseases and risk factors must be identified before therapy.},

Substantial differences in posttreatment remission rates were found (range: 22.2-67.6%) due, in part, to differences in samples and operationalization of clinical significant change. There is robust evidence that CBT-E is an effective treatment for patients with an eating disorder. However, more studies on differential effects and working mechanisms are required to establish the specificity of CBT-E.},

The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of CBT-E with treatment as usual (TAU), which was largely based on CBT principles. We conducted a randomized controlled trial on a total of 143 adult patients with an ED who received either CBT-E or TAU. The primary outcome was recovery from the ED. Secondary outcome measures were levels of ED psychopathology, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Self-esteem, perfectionism, and interpersonal problems were repeatedly measured to examine possible moderating effects. We explored differences in duration and intensity between conditions. After 80 weeks, there were no differences between conditions in decrease in ED psychopathology, or symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, in the first six weeks of treatment there was a larger decrease in ED psychopathology in the CBT-E condition. Moreover, when the internationally most widely used definition of recovery was applied, the recovery rate at 20 weeks of CBT-E was significantly higher (57.7%) than of TAU (36.0%). At 80 weeks, this difference was no longer significant (CBT-E 60.9%; TAU 43.6%). Furthermore, CBT-E was more effective in improving self-esteem and was also the less intensive and shorter treatment. With broader use of CBT-E, the efficiency, accessibility and effectivity (on self-esteem) of treatment for EDs could be improved.},

The expression of TGF-alpha, EGFr, p53 nuclear protein, and proliferation rate was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and survival after partial liver resection. In liver metastases, TGF-alpha expression was low in 42%, intermediate in 35%, and high in 23%. TGF-alpha expression was higher in liver metastases derived from lymph node-positive primary carcinomas, in synchronous and in irresectable liver metastases compared with those derived from lymph node-negative primary carcinomas, metachronous, and resectable liver metastases. Nuclear p53 expression was found in 83% of primary tumors and 71% of liver metastases. p53 expression did not correlate with the various clinicopathological characteristics. Ki67 expression was not associated with clinicopathological characteristics in primary and metastatic tumors. In the 38 patients in whom a partial liver resection was performed, median survival was 25 months in patients with a higher TGF-alpha expression in the metastasis than in the primary tumor and 60 months in patients with comparable or lower TGF-alpha expression in the metastasis than in the primary tumor (P = .036). Median survival after liver resection was 21 months in patients with p53-negative liver metastases and 58 months in patients with p53-positive metastases (P = .043). By multivariate analysis, p53 and EGFr expression on liver metastases were the best predictors of disease-free survival after partial liver resection, with relative risks of 2.38 and 3.33, respectively. In patients with colorectal liver metastases, referred for liver surgery, a higher TGF-alpha expression is associated with unfavorable tumor characteristics, whereas p53 and absence of EGFr expression is associated with a better survival after partial liver resection.},

Recto-perineal and recto-vestibular fistulas were classified as mild CARMs, all others as severe. Significant patent foramen ovale, secundum atrial septal defect, and small ventricular septum defect were classified as minor CHDs, all others as major. Of 129 patients with CARM, 67% had mild CARM, 33% severe CARM, and 17% were additionally diagnosed with CHD. CHDs were distributed equally in patients with mild or severe CARMs. Patients with multiple congenital abnormalities were more frequently diagnosed with CHD (n = 16, 36%) than patients without multiple congenital malformations (n = 5, 9%, P = .001). Patients with CARM diagnosed with CHD using pediatric cardiac echo screening were younger than 3 months of age at diagnosis. Earlier general pediatric examinations missed 7 (50%) children with mild and 4 (50%) with severe CHDs. The severity of CARM could predict neither prevalence nor severity of CHD. More than one-half of CHDs were missed during the first physical examination. No new CHDs were found in patients older than 3 months of age at the time CARMs were diagnosed. We recommend screening all patients with CARM younger than 3 months of age for CHD at the time CARM is diagnosed.

Blood pressure was identical in sham-operated ecSOD+/+ and ecSOD-/- mice. After 6 days of angiotensin II-treatment and 2 and 4 weeks after renal artery clipping, blood pressure was significantly higher in ecSOD-/- than ecSOD+/+ mice. Recombinant ecSOD selectively decreased blood pressure in hypertensive ecSOD-/- mice, whereas ecSOD had no effect in normotensive and hypertensive ecSOD+/+ mice. Compared with sham-operated ecSOD+/+ mice, sham-operated ecSOD-/- mice exhibited attenuated acetylcholine-induced relaxations. These responses were further depressed in vessels from clipped animals. Vascular O2.-, as measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence, was higher in ecSOD-/- compared with ecSOD+/+ mice and was increased by clipping. The antioxidant tiron normalized relaxations in vessels from sham-operated and clipped ecSOD-/-, as well as from clipped ecSOD+/+ mice. In contrast, in vivo application of ecSOD selectively enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation in vessels from ecSOD-/- mice. These data reveal that endogenous ecSOD is a major antagonistic principle to vascular O2.-, controlling blood pressure and vascular function in angiotensin II-dependent models of hypertension. ecSOD is expressed in such an abundance that even in situations of high oxidative stress no relative lack of enzyme activity occurs.},

New Zealand White rabbits were fed over 4 weeks with normal diet or with atherogenic diet and randomized in 3 subgroups (n=7 in each group); placebo, acute cariporide (0.3 mg/kg, 10 min. before occlusion of left anterior descending coronary artery and chronic cariporide (4 weeks 0.1% in chow). In the final infarction experiments the animals were subjected to 30 min. of myocardial ischaemia by occlusion of a branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 2 hr of reperfusion. Infarct mass was evaluated by triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride staining and the infarct size expressed as a percentage of area at risk. Besides the assessment of aortic endothelium-dependent function aortic and cardiac vessels were inspected for atherosclerotic lesions. In cholesterol-fed rabbits, the infarct size was significantly increased when compared with normal diet animals (63+/-3% versus 41+/-3%). Acute cariporide treatment reduced the infarct size in normal diet rabbits to 14%+/-3% (66% decrease, P<0.05) as well as in atherogenic diet rabbits to 22+/-3% (65% decrease, P<0.05). Chronic treatment with cariporide also reduced the infarct size significantly: normal diet 19+/-2% (53% decrease, P<0.05), atherogenic diet 32+/-3% (49% decrease, P<0.05). Total cholesterol serum levels in rabbits with atherogenic diet were significantly higher (15.3+/-2.7 mmol/l) than those on a standard diet (0.65+/-0.08 mmol/l). Chronic cariporide treatment significantly attenuated the increase of serum cholesterol (7.9+/-1.9 mmol/l) and improved the lipoprotein pattern. Although the aortas and heart vessels of hypercholesterolaemic animals were without any histological evidence of atherosclerosis they developed endothelial dysfunction (reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation by ACh), which was prevented by chronic cariporide treatment. Acute and chronic treatment with the NHE-1 inhibitor cariporide significantly reduced infarct mass. This effect was associated with improved endothelial function.},

Data on prevalence and consequences of hypertension are limited, but recent studies suggest that HIV-infected individuals are at a higher risk of developing hypertension. In this prospective study, HIV-1-infected patients from the Frankfurt AIDS Cohort Study (FACS) were followed for 1 year to determine the frequency of systemic hypertension and to assess the associated clinical and demographic factors. A total 214 HIV-1-infected patients, predominantly Caucasian males, participated in the study. Prevalence of systemic hypertension was 29%. The groups of hypertensive and normotensive individuals were comparable in terms of ethnic background and duration of infection. As in the general population, hypertensive subjects were older (49.1+/-11.1 vs 39.0+/-8.1 years; P<0.0001) and waist-to-hip ratio was higher than in normotensive individuals (0.99+/-0.07 vs 0.93+/-0.08; P<0.0001). Hypertension was associated with a much higher frequency of persistent proteinuria (41.1% vs 2.8%; P<0.001), coronary heart disease (16.1% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001) and myocardial infarction (8.1% vs 0.7%; P<0.005), whereas most cardiovascular risk factors were similar in both groups. Our data do not demonstrate any association between the presence of hypertension and antiretroviral therapy or immune status. However, hypertension seems to have a high impact on the existing risk for premature cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, overt proteinuria is frequent in HIV-1 infection with hypertension and might be due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis as well as yet undefined renal disease in these patients.},

We hypothesized that the metabolism of EETs by the sEH contributes to angiotensin II-induced hypertension and tested the effects of a water-soluble sEH inhibitor, 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido) dodecanoic acid (AUDA) on blood pressure. AUDA (130 microg/mL in drinking water) did not affect blood pressure in normotensive animals but markedly lowered it in mice with angiotensin II-induced hypertension (1 mg/kg per day). The effect of AUDA was accompanied by an increase in urinary salt and water excretion. Intravenous application of AUDA (8 mg/kg) acutely lowered blood pressure and heart rate in animals with angiotensin II-induced hypertension but failed to affect blood pressure in animals with phenylephrine-induced hypertension (29 mg/kg per day). AUDA (0.1 micromol/L) selectively lowered vascular resistance in an isolated perfused kidney preparation from angiotensin II-pretreated mice but not from control mice. In the perfused hind limb and in isolated carotid arteries from angiotensin II-treated mice, AUDA was without effect. The omega-hydroxylase inhibitor N-methylsulfonyl-12,12-dibromododec-11-enamide, which attenuates formation of the potent vasoconstrictor 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, decreased tone in carotid arteries from angiotensin II-treated but not from control mice. These data demonstrate that the decrease in blood pressure observed after sEH inhibition in angiotensin II-induced hypertension can be attributed to an initial reduction in heart rate followed by pressure diuresis resulting from increased perfusion of the kidney. Direct vasodilatation of resistance arteries in skeletal muscles does not appear to contribute to the antihypertensive effects of sEH inhibition in mice.},

We studied the function of ecSOD in high-volume hypertension induced by the 1-kidney-1-clip model in wild-type, ecSOD-/- mice, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-/- mice. The 1-kidney-1-clip model resulted in impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and hypertension and vascular oxidative stress in wild-type and ecSOD-/- mice. Recombinant ecSOD lowered the blood pressure and improved aortic nitric oxide bioavailability in wild-type and ecSOD-/- but not eNOS-/- mice. ecSOD had no effect on blood pressure in eNOS-/- or wild-type mice treated with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The 1-kidney-1-clip model markedly induced ecSOD protein expression, whereas activity was increased by only 25%, suggesting a partial inactivation of ecSOD in high-volume hypertension. Incubation of aortic segments with peroxynitrite or hydrogen peroxide attenuated ecSOD activity, but peroxynitrite did not induce tyrosine nitration of ecSOD, suggesting oxidative inactivation of the enzyme. Administration of polyethyleneglycol-catalase for 3 days selectively lowered the blood pressure in ecSOD+/+ but not ecSOD-/- mice and improved nitric oxide bioavailability. In contrast, acute application of catalase had no effect. Nitric oxide mediates the vascular effects of ecSOD. Vascular dysfunction in 1-kidney-1-clip model hypertension is partially a consequence of inactivation of ecSOD by reactive oxygen species.},

EETs are degraded by the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and sEH inhibitors are considered treatment for chronic renal failure (CRF). We determined whether sEH inhibition attenuates the progression of CRF in the 5/6-nephrectomy model (5/6-Nx) in mice. 5/6-Nx mice were treated with a placebo, an ACE-inhibitor (Ramipril, 40 mg/kg), the sEH-inhibitor cAUCB or the CYP-inhibitor fenbendazole for 8 weeks. 5/6-Nx induced hypertension, albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulo-interstitial damage and these effects were attenuated by Ramipril. In contrast, cAUCB failed to lower the blood pressure and albuminuria was more severe as compared to placebo. Plasma EET-levels were doubled in 5/6 Nx-mice as compared to sham mice receiving placebo. Renal sEH expression was attenuated in 5/6-Nx mice but cAUCB in these animals still further increased the EET-level. cAUCB also increased 5-HETE and 15-HETE, which derive from peroxidation or lipoxygenases. Similar to cAUCB, CYP450 inhibition increased HETEs and promoted albuminuria. Thus, sEH-inhibition failed to elicit protective effects in the 5/6-Nx model and showed a tendency to aggravate the disease. These effects might be consequence of a shift of arachidonic acid metabolism into the lipoxygenase pathway.},

Twenty four patients with IVDU underwent renal biopsy because of progressive chronic kidney disease or proteinuria. Renal AA-amyloidosis was the predominant cause of renal failure in 50% of patients. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (GN) was the second most common cause found in 21%. Patients with AA-amyloidosis were more likely to be HIV infected (67 vs.17%; p=0.036) and tended to have a higher rate of repeated systemic infections (92 vs. 50%; p=0.069). Patients with AA-amyloidosis presented with progressive renal disease and nephrotic-range proteinuria but most patients had no peripheral edema or systemic hypertension. Development of proteinuria preceded the decline of GFR for approximately 1-2 years. AA-amyloidosis was the predominant cause of progressive renal disease in the last 10 years in patients with IVDU. The highest rate of AA-amyloidosis observed was seen in HIV infected patients with IVDU. We speculate that chronic HIV-infection as well as the associated immunosuppression might promote development of AA-amyloidosis by increasing frequency and duration of infections acquired by IVDU.},

  abstract = {Uncontrolled hypertension under antihypertensive multidrug regimen is not necessarily always true resistance. Incomplete adherence is one of several possible causes of uncontrolled hypertension. Nonadherence remains largely unrecognized and is falsely interpreted as treatment resistance, as it is difficult to confirm or exclude objectively. This is the first study assessing adherence in patients with apparent resistant hypertension systematically via toxicological urine screening. All patients referred from primary care physicians because of uncontrolled hypertension between 2004 and 2011 were analysed. Adherence was assessed in all patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite the concurrent use of at least four antihypertensive agents by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for antihypertensive drugs or their corresponding metabolites in urine. A total of 375 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were referred. After optimization of drug therapy and exclusion of white coat hypertension, 108 patients met criteria for resistant hypertension. Of those, 15 patients had secondary causes of hypertension and 17 achieved goal blood pressure with quadruple antihypertensive therapy. Of the remaining 76 patients, 40 patients (53%) were found to be nonadherent. Among nonadherent patients, 30% had complete and 70% had incomplete adherence; 85% of the latter had taken less than 50% of drugs prescribed. Lack of adherence was almost evenly distributed between different classes of antihypertensive drugs. Low adherence was the most common cause of poor blood pressure control in patients with apparent resistant hypertension, being twice as frequent as secondary causes of hypertension. Incomplete adherence was far more common than complete nonadherence; thus, assessment of adherence in patients on multiple drug regime is only reliable when all drugs are included in assessment. Assessing adherence by toxicological urine screening is a useful tool in detecting low adherence, especially in the setting of multidrug regimen as a cause of apparently resistant hypertension.},

PEO-coatings were generated on 0.014-inch NiTi and 0.19 × 0.25-inch β-Ti archwires. The surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and stereomicroscopy. Cytocompatibility testing was performed with ceramized and untreated samples according to EN ISO 10993-5 in XTT-, BrdU- and LDH-assays. The direct cell impact was analyzed using LIVE-/DEAD-staining. In addition, the archwires were inserted in an orthodontic model and photographs were taken before and after insertion. The PEO coatings were 15 to 20 µm thick with a whitish appearance. The cytocompatibility analysis revealed good cytocompatibility results for both ceramized NiTi and β-Ti archwires. In the direct cell tests, the ceramized samples showed improved compatibility as compared to those of uncoated samples. However, bending of the archwires resulted in loss of the PEO-surfaces. Nevertheless, it was possible to insert the β-Ti PEO-coated archwire in an orthodontic model without loss of the PEO-ceramic. PEO is a promising technique for the generation of esthetic orthodontic archwires. Since the PEO-coating does not resist bending, its clinical use seems to be limited so far to orthodontic techniques using straight or pre-bent archwires.},

  abstract = {Magnesium (Mg)-based biomaterials are promising candidates for bone and tissue regeneration. Alloying and surface modifications provide effective strategies for optimizing and tailoring their degradation kinetics. Nevertheless, biocompatibility analyses of Mg-based materials are challenging due to its special degradation mechanism with continuous hydrogen release. In this context, the hydrogen release and the related (micro-) milieu conditions pretend to strictly follow in vitro standards based on ISO 10993-5/-12. Thus, special adaptions for the testing of Mg materials are necessary, which have been described in a previous study from our group. Based on these adaptions, further developments of a test procedure allowing rapid and effective in vitro cytocompatibility analyses of Mg-based materials based on ISO 10993-5/-12 are necessary. The following study introduces a new two-step test scheme for rapid and effective testing of Mg. Specimens with different surface characteristics were produced by means of plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) using silicate-based and phosphate-based electrolytes. The test samples were evaluated for corrosion behavior, cytocompatibility and their mechanical and osteogenic properties. Thereby, two PEO ceramics could be identified for further in vivo evaluations.},

  abstract = {The degradation rate of magnesium (Mg) alloys is a key parameter to develop Mg-based biomaterials and ensure in vivo-mechanical stability as well as to minimize hydrogen gas production, which otherwise can lead to adverse effects in clinical applications. However, in vitro and in vivo results of the same material often differ largely. In the present study, a dynamic test bench with several single bioreactor cells was constructed to measure the volume of hydrogen gas which evolves during magnesium degradation to indicate the degradation rate in vivo. Degradation medium comparable with human blood plasma was used to simulate body fluids. The media was pumped through the different bioreactor cells under a constant flow rate and 37 °C to simulate physiological conditions. A total of three different Mg groups were successively tested: Mg WE43, and two different WE43 plasma electrolytically oxidized (PEO) variants. The results were compared with other methods to detect magnesium degradation (pH, potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), cytocompatibility, SEM (scanning electron microscopy)). The non-ceramized specimens showed the highest degradation rates and vast standard deviations. In contrast, the two PEO samples demonstrated reduced degradation rates with diminished standard deviation. The pH values showed above-average constant levels between 7.4-7.7, likely due to the constant exchange of the fluids. SEM revealed severe cracks on the surface of WE43 after degradation, whereas the ceramized surfaces showed significantly decreased signs of corrosion. PDP results confirmed the improved corrosion resistance of both PEO samples. While WE43 showed slight toxicity in vitro, satisfactory cytocompatibility was achieved for the PEO test samples. In summary, the dynamic test bench constructed in this study enables reliable and simple measurement of Mg degradation to simulate the in vivo environment. Furthermore, PEO treatment of magnesium is a promising method to adjust magnesium degradation.},

We now report that VEGFR2 causes PKA-mediated phosphorylation of VLA-4 on S988, an event known to stimulate tumor metastasis while suppressing cytotoxic immune cells. A key partner in this mechanism is the chemokine receptor CXCR4, a well-known mediator of cell motility in response to gradients of the chemokine SDF-1 (also known as CXCL12). The entire machinery necessary to phosphorylate VLA-4, consisting of CXCR4, AC7 (also known as ADCY7) and PKA, is constitutively associated with VEGFR2 and is localized to the integrin by Sdc1. VEGFR2 carries out the novel phosphorylation of Y135 within the DRY microswitch of CXCR4, sequentially activating Gα},

During the bone drilling process, heat is generated on the drill head and within the surrounding tissue. As a result, the increased temperature can lead to thermal damage and related necrosis of the (bone) tissue. This tissue damage is dependent on different drilling parameters and can have important influence on the following tissue healing cascade and finally on implant surveillance. In this context, the present short review elucidates the current state of scientific knowledge with regard to the heat-triggering factors during the bony drilling process and how these factors can be better understood and prevented, now and in the future, through new research approaches. External and internal influencing factors during the drilling process are distinguished and methods to examine the temperature changes are compared. This mini-review further demonstrates first preliminary results of the inflammatory tissue reactions to inadequate drilling processes. Furthermore, possible solutions of new standardized ex vivo-measurement methods to better understand the factors influencing the development of heat and to reduce animal experiments are herein discussed.},

It will be critical to establish the degree of physiological complexity that is needed in each CIVM to accurately reproduce native-like homeostasis and disease phenotypes, as well as clinical pharmacological responses. Choosing which CIVM to use at each stage of the drug discovery and development pipeline will be driven by a fit-for-purpose approach, based on the specific disease pathomechanism to model and screening throughput needed.

Biofabrication technologies, including bioprinting approaches with hydrogels and biomaterials, have enabled the production of tissues with a range of physiological complexity and controlled spatial arrangements in multiwell plate platforms, which make them amenable for medium-throughput screening. However, operationalization of such 3D biofabricated models using existing automation screening platforms comes with a unique set of challenges.

Physiologically relevant tissue models of the lower respiratory tract (LRT), including the respiratory bronchioles and the alveolar sacs, are of high interest because they are the primary site of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and are most affected during the terminal stage of COVID-19. Current epithelial lung models used to study respiratory viral infections include lung epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI) with fibroblasts and endothelial cells, but such models do not have a perfusable microvascular network to investigate both viral infectivity and viral infection-induced thrombotic events. Using a high throughput, 64-chip microfluidic plate-based platform, we have developed two novel vascularized, LRT multi-chip models for the alveoli and the small airway. Both models include a perfusable microvascular network consisting of human primary microvascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pericytes. The established biofabrication protocols also enable the formation of differentiated lung epithelial layers at the ALI on top of the vascularized tissue bed. We validated the physiologically relevant cellular composition, architecture and perfusion of the vascularized lung tissue models using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and electrical resistance measurements. These vascularized, perfusable microfluidic lung tissue on high throughput assay platforms will enable the development of respiratory viral infection and disease models for research investigation and drug discovery.},

The recently developed pan-KRAS inhibitor daraxonrasib, also known as RMC-6236, is capable of targeting a wide array of KRAS mutations and shows promise against pancreatic and lung cancers. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of action of daraxonrasib in osteosarcoma (OS) remain unclear. We evaluated the effects of daraxonrasib on the viability, proliferation, and metastatic potential of wild-type and KRAS mutant OS cells. We assayed the effects of treatment on downstream targets using qPCR, immunoblotting, and activity assays to explore the underlying mechanism by which daraxonrasib selectively suppresses the metastatic potential of KRAS mutant osteosarcoma. Finally, we investigated how the increased prevalence of GTP-bound KRAS enhanced the sensitivity of KRAS wild-type osteosarcoma cells to daraxonrasib using siRNA targeting RASA1. Daraxonrasib selectively attenuated the proliferation and migratory ability of KRAS mutant HOS-143B cells without affecting KRAS wild-type controls. Additionally, daraxonrasib suppressed the expression of the matrix metalloproteases MMP9 and MMP1, which promote cell motility and metastasis. Daraxonrasib selectively inhibited the AKT/ETS1 pathway in HOS-143B cells, whereas no such effect was observed in HOS cells. HOS cells were sensitized to daraxonrasib by knocking down the GTPase-activating protein RASA1. In osteosarcoma, KRAS inhibition decreased MMP1, MMP9, and AKT/ETS1 signaling. Daraxonrasib is a promising agent for treating osteosarcoma with KRAS mutations.},

In this brief review, the different fabrication techniques: laser-based, extrusion-based and inkjet-based bioprinting, are defined, elaborated and compared. Advantages and challenges of each technique are addressed as well as the current research status of each technique towards various tissue types. Nozzle-based techniques, like inkjet and extrusion printing, and laser-based techniques, like stereolithography and laser-assisted bioprinting, are all capable of producing successful bioprinted scaffolds. These four techniques were found to have diverse effects on cell viability, resolution and print fidelity. Additionally, the choice of materials and their concentrations were also found to impact the printing characteristics.

The development of bone tissue engineering has been used to create functional alternatives to regenerate bone. This can be achieved by producing bone tissue scaffolds that induce osteoconduction and integration, provide mechanical stability, and either integrate into the bone structure or degrade and are excreted by the body. A range of different biomaterials have been used to this end, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. This review will introduce the requirements of bone tissue engineering, beginning with the regeneration process of bone before exploring the requirements of bone tissue scaffolds.

Kis prevents the inhibition of E. coli cell growth caused by the RNA cleavage activity of Kid. Overproduction of MazE, the chromosome-encoded homologue of Kis, has been demonstrated to neutralize Kid toxicity to a certain extent in the absence of native Kis. Here, we show that a high structural similarity exists between these antitoxins, using NMR spectroscopy. We report about the interactions between Kid and Kis that are responsible for neutralization of Kid toxicity and enhance autoregulation of parD transcription. Native macromolecular mass spectrometry data demonstrate that Kid and Kis form multiple complexes. At Kis:Kid ratios equal to or exceeding 1:1, as found in vivo in a plasmid-containing cell, various complexes are present, ranging from Kid(2)-Kis(2) tetramer up to Kis(2)-Kid(2)-Kis(2)-Kid(2)-Kis(2) decamer. When Kid is in excess of Kis, corresponding to an in vivo situation immediately after loss of the plasmid, the Kid(2)-Kis(2)-Kid(2) heterohexamer is the most abundant species. NMR chemical shift and intensity perturbations in the (1)H (15)N HSQC spectra of Kid and Kis, observed when titrating the partner protein, show that the interaction sites of Kid and Kis resemble those within the previously reported MazF(2)-MazE(2)-MazF(2) complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Kid(2)-MazE(2) tetramers can be formed via weak interactions involving a limited part of the Kis-binding residues of Kid. The functional roles of the identified Kid-Kis and Kid-MazE interaction sites and complexes in toxin neutralization and repression of transcription are discussed.},

Histological analysis included qualitative and semi-quantitative light microscopy analysis of proximal tubules. Exogenous melatonin had no significant effect on the microstructure, independently of dosis. The changes of proximal tubules microstructure induced by gentamicin were expressed in the form of granulovacuolar degeneration, necrosis and desquamation. The grade of proximal tubular changes was smaller in animals who besides gentamicin received melatonin.

  abstract = {Collagen-based barrier membranes are an essential component in Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) procedures. They act as cell-occlusive devices that should maintain a micromilieu where bone tissue can grow, which in turn provides a stable bed for prosthetic implantation. However, the standing time of collagen membranes has been a challenging area, as native membranes are often prematurely resorbed. Therefore, consolidation techniques, such as chemical cross-linking, have been used to enhance the structural integrity of the membranes, and by consequence, their standing time. However, these techniques have cytotoxic tendencies and can cause exaggerated inflammation and in turn, premature resorption, and material failures. However, tissues from different extraction sites and animals are variably cross-linked. For the present in vivo study, a new collagen membrane based on bovine dermis was extracted and compared to a commercially available porcine-sourced collagen membrane extracted from the pericardium. The membranes were implanted in Wistar rats for up to 60 days. The analyses included well-established histopathological and histomorphometrical methods, including histochemical and immunohistochemical staining procedures, to detect M1- and M2-macrophages as well as blood vessels. Initially, the results showed that both membranes remained intact up to day 30, while the bovine membrane was fragmented at day 60 with granulation tissue infiltrating the implantation beds. In contrast, the porcine membrane remained stable without signs of material-dependent inflammatory processes. Therefore, the bovine membrane showed a special integration pattern as the fragments were found to be overlapping, providing secondary porosity in combination with a transmembraneous vascularization. Altogether, the bovine membrane showed comparable results to the porcine control group in terms of biocompatibility and standing time. Moreover, blood vessels were found within the bovine membranes, which can potentially serve as an additional functionality of barrier membranes that conventional barrier membranes do not provide.},

Human, cytosolic Hsp90 is dedicated to folding of chiefly signal transduction components. The chaperoning mechanism of Hsp90 is controlled by ATP and various cochaperones, but is poorly understood and controversial. Here, we characterized the Apo and ATP states of the 170-kDa human Hsp90 full-length protein by NMR spectroscopy in solution, and we elucidated the mechanism of the inhibition of its ATPase by its cochaperone p23. We assigned isoleucine side chains of Hsp90 via specific isotope labeling of their δ-methyl groups, which allowed the NMR analysis of the full-length protein. We found that ATP caused exclusively local changes in Hsp90's N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain. Native mass spectrometry showed that Hsp90 and p23 form a 22 complex via a positively cooperative mechanism. Despite this stoichiometry, NMR data indicated that the complex was not fully symmetric. The p23-dependent NMR shifts mapped to both the lid and the adenine end of Hsp90's ATP binding pocket, but also to large parts of the middle domain. Shifts distant from the p23 binding site reflect p23-induced conformational changes in Hsp90. Together, we conclude that it is Hsp90's nucleotide-binding domain that triggers the formation of the Hsp90(2)p23(2) complex. We anticipate that our NMR approach has significant impact on future studies of full-length Hsp90 with cofactors and substrates, but also for the development of Hsp90 inhibiting anticancer drugs.},

Here, we obtained a structural model of Hsp90 in complex with its natural disease-associated substrate, the intrinsically disordered Tau protein. Hsp90 binds to a broad region in Tau that includes the aggregation-prone repeats. Complementarily, a 106-Å-long substrate-binding interface in Hsp90 enables many low-affinity contacts. This allows recognition of scattered hydrophobic residues in late folding intermediates that remain after early burial of the Hsp70 sites. Our model resolves the paradox of how Hsp90 specifically selects for late folding intermediates but also for some intrinsically disordered proteins-through the eyes of Hsp90 they look the same.},

Polyvalent EBV-IgG analysis, EBV-IgG/IgM/IgA western blot analysis as well as quantitative EBV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were performed. Leptospira IHA showed an initial titer of 1:640 (cut-off 1:320), leptospiral IgG was negative, but IgM was positive. MAT was negative at that time for all 17 strains analyzed. One week later, leptospirosis IHA titer increased to 1:20,480. Leptospiral IgG was now positive, -IgM remained positive and urine was tested negative for leptospiral DNA. The MAT showed positive results for L. interrogans serovar Bataviae, serovar Copenhageni, serovar Pyrogenes and L. borgpetersenii serovar Serjoe. During follow-up examinations, both the leptospiral IgM and IgG remained positive and MAT showed positive results for L. interrogans of different serovars. EBV IgA immunoblot taken at admission was positive for VCA-p18, quantitative EBV-PCR showed an EBV viral load of 2.8E3 copies/ml indicating acute EBV-reactivation. Leptospirosis represents a neglected and re-emerging disease which is difficult to diagnose since Leptospira-PCR from whole blood or urine is frequently negative in the case of early empiric antibiotic treatment. EBV-reactivation might represent a severe complication in Weil's disease which potentially aggravates clinical manifestations of leptospirosis including hepatitis, nephritis, and rhabdomyolysis. Thus, there might be a need for peripheral blood EBV-PCR and EBV blotting in patients suffering from complicated Weil syndrome, also in terms of the choice of antibiotic treatment.},

  abstract = {Vasodilation is a well-known side effect of contrast media (CM) that is primarily explained by the hyperosmolality of the media. Few reports have dealt with the influences of chemotoxicity and ion toxicity on vessel tone. We compared the effects of solutions iso-osmolar to plasma of iohexol (nonionic monomer), ioxaglate (ionic dimer), diatrizoate (ionic monomer), and mannitol on responses to vasoconstrictors (potassium chloride [KCl], histamine, and endothelin-1). The aim of this study was to investigate if differences in chemotoxicity and ion toxicity could contribute to the changes in vessel tone seen clinically during arteriography. Segments of rabbit coronary arteries were mounted between two L-shaped prongs in tissue baths with buffer solution or CM solutions. Their responses to increasing concentrations of a vasoconstrictor were measured. The maximal contraction of the vasoconstrictor (Emax) and the concentration of the vasoconstrictor causing half maximal contraction (EC50) were calculated. Iohexol caused the same changes as the nonionic solution of mannitol. The media reduced the actions of KCl, histamine, and endothelin-1 to 50% to 60% of their action in buffer. The ionic CM, ioxaglate and diatrizoate, caused a more pronounced inhibition of histamine and almost totally inhibited the action of KCl. The action of endothelin-1 was inhibited to a greater extent by iohexol and mannitol than by ioxaglate and diatrizoate. Different types of iso-osmolar CM interact differently with vasoconstrictors. These effects are caused by differences in chemo- and ion toxicity. These interactions might contribute to the differences in vasodilatation found clinically.},

Vasoconstriction dependent on potential-operated calcium channels (POCs) (potassium chloride), or receptor-operated calcium channels (ROCs) (histamine, endothelin-1, and prostaglandin F2 [PGF2 alpha]) was specifically studied. Segments of rabbit coronary arteries were mounted between two L-shaped prongs in tissue baths with buffer solution or solutions of iohexol (140 mg I/mL) with addition of different concentrations of NaCl and CaCl2. The responses of the vessels to increasing concentrations of a vasoconstrictor were examined. Concentration of vasoconstrictor versus contractile response curves were plotted, and the maximal contraction of the vasoconstrictor (Emax) and half maximal constriction were calculated. Addition of 30 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM CaCl2 caused a vasoconstriction to KCl in iohexol almost identical to its vasoconstriction in buffer. Higher concentrations of NaCl caused decreasing Emax of all vasoconstrictors. The inhibition of the ROC-dependent vasoconstrictors could not be normalized by the addition of electrolytes. The inhibition of the POC-dependent vasoconstrictor was caused by "ion toxicity" of iohexol. The inhibition of the ROC-dependent vasoconstrictors was caused by other mechanisms, in a manner compatible with a blocking effect on ROCs.},

This study evaluates a contrast medium-induced vasoconstriction that occurs when isolated arteries are exposed directly to a CM. Segments of rabbit coronary arteries were mounted in tissue baths containing buffer solution. During the experiments the buffer solution was exchanged with iohexol iso-osmolar with plasma, which caused a temporary vasoconstriction of the vessel segments. The constriction did not depend on the degree of oxygenation of iohexol. The endothelium was not involved in the vasoconstriction. Prazosin slightly decreased the vasoconstriction and a small part of the constriction might thus depend on liberation of norepinephrine by iohexol. The constriction was totally inhibited by the calcium antagonist nifedipine, while it was augmented by addition of low concentrations of KCl to ihoexol. It is concluded that the otherwise safe CM iohexol causes vasoconstriction in vitro by depolarizing the smooth muscle cells and the nerve terminals in the vessel wall.},

The nonionic contrast medium, iohexol, inhibits vasoactive substances to a lesser extent than ionic contrast media. Iohexol inhibited the action of vasoconstrictors in a way that raised suspicion of a calcium antagonistic effect of the medium. The authors test this hypothesis by comparing the inhibitory effect of iohexol with the inhibitory effect of a calcium antagonist (nifedipine). The vasoconstrictors were KCl, which depends on potential-operated calcium channels, and histamine, endothelin-1, and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), which depend on receptor-operated calcium channels. Segments of rabbit coronary arteries were mounted between two L-shaped prongs in tissue baths containing calcium-free buffer, calcium-free buffer with 10(-8) M nifedipine, or iohexol. One of the vasoconstrictors, KCl, histamine, endothelin-1, or PGF2 alpha, was added to induce a level of activation. Thereafter, increasing concentrations of CaCl2 were added in a stepwise manner, and the contractile responses of the vessel segments were recorded. Addition of CaCl2 caused concentration-dependent vasoconstrictions in the buffer. The effect of adding CaCl2 was inhibited in the buffer with nifedipine and in iohexol when the vessels were activated with histamine, endothelin-1, or PGF2 alpha. When the vessels were activated with the potential-operated calcium channel-dependent vasoconstrictor, KCl, the effect of adding CaCl2 was inhibited in the buffer with nifedipine but not in iohexol. In vitro, iohexol had the same effect as the calcium antagonist nifedipine on the action of receptor-operated calcium channel-dependent vasoconstrictors. This suggests a calcium antagonistic effect of iohexol on the action of the ROC.},

The present study describes a CM-induced vasoconstriction of isolated rabbit coronary arteries that depends on chemotoxicity and ion content of the CM. Rings of arteries were mounted in tissue baths and the constrictions induced by different CM were measured. Iotrolan and iodixanol (non-ionic dimers) caused the most powerful constrictions followed by iohexol (non-ionic monomer) and mannitol. Ioxaglate (ionic dimer) and diatrizoate (ionic monomer) caused no or weak constrictions. By comparing these findings with previous studies, it is concluded that non-ionic media cause vasoconstriction due to depolarization of the smooth muscle cells, an effect that for iohexol can be counteracted by addition of 30 mM NaCl. The ionic media seem to cause hyperpolarization of the cells. This difference between non-ionic and ionic CM might be one of the reasons for the lower tendency of non-ionic CM to cause vasodilatation clinically.},

The factors governing their affinity remain elusive however, especially when it comes to describing dissociation rates (koff). Here we demonstrate that, next to direct contributions from the interface, the non-interacting surface (NIS) also plays an important role in binding affinity, especially polar and charged residues. Their percentage on the NIS is conserved over orthologous complexes indicating an evolutionary selection pressure. Their effect on binding affinity can be explained by long-range electrostatic contributions and surface-solvent interactions that are known to determine the local frustration of the protein complex surface. Including these in a simple model significantly improves the affinity prediction of protein complexes from structural models. The impact of mutations outside the interacting surface on binding affinity is supported by experimental alanine scanning mutagenesis data. These results enable the development of more sophisticated and integrated biophysical models of binding affinity and open new directions in experimental control and modulation of biomolecular interactions.},

Recently, we showed that an autoimmune response to cardiac troponin I (cTnI) induces severe inflammation and subsequent fibrosis in the myocardium. This autoimmune disorder predisposes to heart failure and cardiac death in mice. To investigate the role of cTnI-specific T cells, T cells were isolated from splenocytes of mice immunized with murine cTnI (mcTnI). Wild-type mice that received mcTnI-specific T cells showed high mcTnI-specific antibody titers, increased production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, severe inflammation and fibrosis in the myocardium, and reduced fractional shortening. To identify the antigenic determinants of troponin I responsible for the observed inflammation, fibrosis, and heart failure, 16 overlapping 16mer to 18mer peptides covering the entire amino acid sequence of mcTnI (211 residues) were synthesized. Only mice immunized with residues 105 to 122 of mcTnI developed significant inflammation and fibrosis in the myocardium, with increased expression of the inflammatory chemokines RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, T-cell activation-3, and eotaxin and the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5. Mice immunized with the corresponding human cTnI residues 104 to 121 and the mcTnI residues 131 to 148 developed milder disease. Transfer of troponin I-specific T cells can induce inflammation and fibrosis in wild-type mice, which leads to deterioration of contractile function. Furthermore, 2 sequence motifs of cTnI that induce inflammation and fibrosis in the myocardium are characterized.},

While tree regeneration is a highly stochastic process, tree regeneration studies often cover narrow environmental gradients only, focusing on specific forest types or species in distinct regions. Thus, the larger-scale effects of temperature, water availability, and stand structure on tree regeneration are poorly understood.We investigated these effects in respect of tree recruitment (in-growth) along wide environmental gradients using forest inventory data from Flanders (Belgium), northwestern Germany, and Switzerland covering more than 40 tree species. We employed generalized linear mixed models to capture the abundance of tree recruitment in response to basal area, stem density, shade casting ability of a forest stand as well as site-specific degree-day sum (temperature), water balance, and plant-available water holding capacity. We grouped tree species to facilitate comparisons between species with different levels of tolerance to shade and drought.Basal area and shade casting ability of the overstory had generally a negative impact on tree recruitment, but the effects differed between levels of shade tolerance of tree recruitment in all study regions. Recruitment rates of very shade-tolerant species were positively affected by shade casting ability. Stem density and summer warmth (degree-day sum) had similar effects on all tree species and successional strategies. Water-related variables revealed a high degree of uncertainty and did not allow for general conclusions. All variables had similar effects independent of the varying diameter thresholds for tree recruitment in the different data sets.},

However, in clinical practice we usually focus on macro-hemodynamic variables such as blood pressure, heart rate, and sometimes cardiac output. Other macro-hemodynamic variables like pulse pressure or stroke volume variation are additionally used as markers of fluid responsiveness. In recent years, an increasing number of technological devices assessing tissue oxygenation or microcirculatory blood flow have been developed and validated, and some of them have already been incorporated into clinical practice. In this review, we will summarize recent research findings on this topic as published in the last 2 years in the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing (JCMC). While some techniques are already currently used as routine monitoring (e.g. cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)), others still have to find their way into clinical practice. Therefore, further research is needed, particularly regarding outcome measures and cost-effectiveness, since introducing new technology is always expensive and should be balanced by downstream savings. The JCMC is glad to provide a platform for such research.},

  abstract = {O3® Regional Oximetry (Masimo Corporation, California, USA) is validated for cerebral oximetry. We aimed to assess agreement of somatic and renal near-infrared spectroscopy with reference blood samples. O3 sensors were placed bilaterally on the quadriceps and flank of 26 healthy volunteers. A stepped, controlled hypoxia sequence was performed by adding a mixture of nitrogen and room air to the breathing circuit. O3-derived oxygen saturation values were obtained at baseline and at six decremental saturation levels (5% steps). Blood samples (radial artery, iliac vein (somatic reference) and renal vein) were obtained at each step. Reference values were calculated as: 0.7 × venous saturation + 0.3 × arterial saturation. The agreement between O3-derived values with blood reference values was assessed by calculating root-mean-square error accuracy and Bland-Altman plots. The root-mean-square error accuracy was 6.0% between quadriceps oxygen saturation and somatic reference values. The mean bias was 0.8%, with limits of agreement from -7.7 to 9.3%. These were 5.1% and 0.6% (-8.3 to 9.5%) for flank oxygen saturation and somatic reference values, respectively, and 7.7% and -4.9% (-15.0 to 5.2%) for flank oxygen saturation and renal reference values. The kidney depth was 3.1 ± 0.9 cm below the skin. O3 regional oximetry can be used on the quadriceps and flank to monitor somatic saturation, yet has a saturation-level dependent bias. O3-derived values obtained at the flank underestimated renal reference values. Additionally, it is unlikely that the flank sensors did directly measure renal tissue.

Secondarily, we assessed if an educational intervention and mandated mean arterial pressure (MAP), or the implementation of the Hypotension Prediction Index-software (HPI) were associated with a reduction in IOH. Structured interviews (n = 27) and questionnaires (n = 84) were conducted to explore clinicians' beliefs and barriers to IOH treatment, in addition to usefulness of HPI questionnaires (n = 14). 150 elective major surgical patients who required invasive blood pressure monitoring were included in three cohorts to assess incidence and time-weighted average (TWA) of hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg). Cohort one received standard care (baseline), the clinicians of cohort two had a training on hypotension and a mandated MAP > 65 mmHg, and patients of the third cohort received protocolized care using the HPI. Clinicians felt challenged to manage IOH in some patients, yet they reported sufficient knowledge and skills. HPI-software was considered useful and beneficial. No difference was found in incidence of IOH between cohorts. TWA was comparable between baseline and education cohort (0.15 mmHg [0.05-0.41] vs. 0.11 mmHg [0.02-0.37]), but was significantly lower in the HPI cohort (0.04 mmHg [0.00 to 0.11], p < 0.05 compared to both). Clinicians believed they had sufficient knowledge and skills, which could explain why no difference was found after the educational intervention. In the HPI cohort, IOH was significantly reduced compared to baseline, therefore HPI-software may help prevent IOH. ISRCTN 17,085,700 on May 9th, 2019.},

Prospective study. Clinical evaluation of a new method. Neurological intensive care unit of a university hospital. Ten patients with acute complete middle cerebral artery territory- or hemispheric infarctions. Two combined fiberoptic thermistor catheters were placed in the right jugular bulb and in the thoracic aorta. Central venous injections of ice-cold indocyanine green dye were performed. CBF was estimated by calculating the mean transit times of the cold bolus and dye. A total of 104 reproducible CBF measurements were obtained. No complications associated with the method were observed. Twelve pairs of measurements were performed within 30 mins with unchanged clinical conditions. The standard deviation of repeated measurements was 2.7 mL/100 g/min; the interrater reliability was between 0.95 and 0.99. The median CBF in patients who died (n = 4) was lower (27 mL/100g/min) than in those who survived (n = 6) (45 mL/100g/ min). Patients who died more frequently had low CBF values of <30 mL/100g/min (22 of 38; 58%) than patients who survived (10 of 54; 19%). A total of 37 CBF measurements were done during ICP elevation of >20 mm Hg. In patients who survived, ICP elevations were only associated with low CBF values in 5 of 26 events; whereas in patients who died, ICP elevations were associated with low CBF values in 8 of 11 events. The new double indicator dilution technique may be suitable for serial bedside CBF measurement. It is easy to perform and can be rapidly repeated in the ICU environment. Validation of the method by comparison with standard methods is needed. The preliminary data indicate that bedside monitoring of CBF may give prognostic information for outcome and may guide therapy of elevated ICP in patients with malignant hemispheric infarction.},

  abstract = {The success of some chemo- and radiotherapeutic regimens relies on the induction of immunogenic tumor cell death and on the induction of an anticancer immune response. Cells succumbing to immunogenic cell death undergo specific changes in their surface characteristics and release pro-immunogenic factors according to a defined spatiotemporal pattern. This stimulates antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells to efficiently take up tumor antigens, process them, and cross-prime cytotoxic T lymphocytes, thus eliciting a tumor-specific cognate immune response. Such a response can also target therapy-resistant tumor (stem) cells, thereby leading, at least in some instances, to tumor eradication. In this review, we shed some light on the molecular identity of the factors that are required for cell death to be perceived as immunogenic. We discuss the intriguing observations that the most abundant endoplasmic reticulum protein, calreticulin, the most abundant intracellular metabolite, ATP, and the most abundant non-histone chromatin-binding protein, HMGB1, can determine whether cell death is immunogenic as they appear on the surface or in the microenvironment of dying cells.},

Nevertheless, a central role for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response has been revealed in all scenarios of ICD described thus far.

  abstract = {Apoptotic cells have long been considered as intrinsically tolerogenic or unable to elicit immune responses specific for dead cell-associated antigens. However, multiple stimuli can trigger a functionally peculiar type of apoptotic demise that does not go unnoticed by the adaptive arm of the immune system, which we named "immunogenic cell death" (ICD). ICD is preceded or accompanied by the emission of a series of immunostimulatory damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in a precise spatiotemporal configuration. Several anticancer agents that have been successfully employed in the clinic for decades, including various chemotherapeutics and radiotherapy, can elicit ICD. Moreover, defects in the components that underlie the capacity of the immune system to perceive cell death as immunogenic negatively influence disease outcome among cancer patients treated with ICD inducers. Thus, ICD has profound clinical and therapeutic implications. Unfortunately, the gold-standard approach to detect ICD relies on vaccination experiments involving immunocompetent murine models and syngeneic cancer cells, an approach that is incompatible with large screening campaigns. Here, we outline strategies conceived to detect surrogate markers of ICD },

Primary efficacy end points were (1) total IPSS and (2) Total Urgency and Frequency Score (TUFS). An FDC met the success criteria if it demonstrated superiority compared with placebo and noninferiority compared with TOCAS for total IPSS, as well as superiority compared with TOCAS for TUFS. Reductions in total IPSS and TUFS were observed with both solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS (-7.0 and -8.1, respectively) and solifenacin 9 mg plus TOCAS (-6.5 and -7.6, respectively) compared with TOCAS (-6.2 and -6.7, respectively) and placebo (-5.4 and -4.4, respectively). Solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS met all prespecified success criteria for both primary end points, while solifenacin 9 mg plus TOCAS met success criteria compared with placebo but not compared with TOCAS. Both FDCs improved quality of life (QoL) measures and were well tolerated, with low incidences of acute urinary retention. The FDC of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS significantly improved storage and voiding symptoms, as well as QoL parameters, compared with placebo. This FDC also improved storage symptoms and QoL compared with TOCAS alone in men with moderate to severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms, and it was well tolerated.},

This retrospective multicentre cohort study investigated the results of THL and subsequent pregnancy rates. Between 2000 and 2011, 1033 subfertile women participated in the study. The primary outcome measure was intrauterine pregnancy, either after natural conception or after treatment with intrauterine insemination or ovulation induction. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and fecundity rate ratios (FRR) were established. THL showed bilateral patent tubes in 83%, one-sided tubal occlusion in 12.4% and bilateral tubal occlusion in 4.6% of women. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates after 36 months were 52% for women with bilateral patent tubes, 44% for one-sided tubal occlusion (FRR 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.39) and 7% for bilateral tubal occlusion (FRR 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.43). Endometriosis was diagnosed in 6.4%, and adhesions in 9.1%, while 3.9% of women had both. Corresponding FRR were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.09), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.46 to 1.02) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.84). In conclusion, women with bilateral tubal occlusion or a combination of endometriosis and adhesions found on THL significantly reduced chances of natural conception.},

  abstract = {In the present study the cellular uptake of targeted immunoliposomes by interleukin-1 activated human endothelial cells has been analysed by several spectroscopical and microscopical fluorescence techniques. Previous in vitro experiments demonstrated that the targeting of immunoliposomes to vascular selectins is a potential way for a selective drug delivery at inflammatory sites. In attempts to further adapt the targeting experiments to physiological conditions, we demonstrate that E-Selectin-directed immunoliposomes are able to bind their target cells under the simulated shear force conditions of capillary blood flow cumulatively for up to 18 h. In order to consequently follow the fate of liposomes after target binding, we analysed the route and degree of liposome internalization of the cells concentrating on cell activation state or various liposomal parameters, e.g., sterical stabilization, type of antibody or antibody coupling strategy. The use of NBD-labelled liposomes and subsequent fluorescence quenching outside the cells with dithionite show that circa 25% of the targeted immunoliposomes were internalized. According to inhibition experiments with agents that interfered with the endocytotic pathway, we found out that the major mechanism of liposome entry is endocytic. The entry involves, at least in part, receptor-mediated endocytosis via E-Selectin, a liposome accumulation in the endosomes and their acidification was proved by pyranine spectroscopic results. Furthermore, microscopical investigations demonstrate that also a fusion of liposomes with the cell membrane occurs followed by a release of entrapped calcein into the cytoplasm. These observations gain insight into the behaviour of E-Selectin-targeted immunoliposomes and indicate that these immunoliposomes have great potential to be used as drug carriers for intracellular drug delivery at inflammatory sites.},

  abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that the efficacy of medical treatments is determined in critical part by the therapeutic context in which it is delivered. An important characteristic of that context is treatment history. We recently reported first evidence for a carry-over of treatment experience to subsequent treatment response across different treatment approaches. Here we expand on these findings by exploring the psychological and neurobiological underpinnings of the effect of treatment experience on future treatment response in an experimental model of placebo analgesia with a conditioning procedure. In a combined behavioral and neuroimaging study we experimentally induced positive or negative experiences with an analgesic treatment in two groups of healthy human subjects. Subsequently we compared responses to a second, different analgesic treatment between both groups. We found that participants with an experimentally induced negative experience with the first treatment showed a substantially reduced response to a second analgesic treatment. Intriguingly, several psychological trait variables including anxiety, depression and locus of control modulate the susceptibility for the effects of prior treatment experiences on future treatment outcome. These behavioral effects were supported by neuroimaging data which showed significant differences in brain regions encoding pain and analgesia between groups. These differences in activation patterns were present not only during the pain phase, but also already prior to painful stimulation and scaled with the individual treatment response. Our data provide behavioral and neurobiological evidence showing that the influence of treatment history transfers over time and over therapeutic approaches. Our experimental findings emphasize the careful consideration of treatment history and a strictly systematic treatment approach to avoid negative carry-over effects.},

Currently, different national programs are being developed to monitor arthropod trends and to unravel the effects of forest management on biodiversity in forests. To establish effective long-term monitoring programs, a set of drivers of arthropod diversity and composition as well as suitable species groups have to be identified. To aid in answering these questions, we investigated arthropod data collected in four Hessian forest reserves (FR) in the 1990s. To fully utilize this data set, we combined it with results from a retrospective structural sampling design applied at the original trap locations in central European beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests. As expected, the importance of the different forest structural, vegetation, and site attributes differed largely between the investigated arthropod groups: beetles, spiders, Aculeata, and true bugs. Measures related to light availability and temperature such as canopy cover or potential radiation were important to all groups affecting either richness, composition, or both. Spiders and true bugs were affected by the broadest range of explanatory variables, which makes them a good choice for monitoring general trends. For targeted monitoring focused on forestry-related effects on biodiversity, rove and ground beetles seem more suitable. Both groups were driven by a narrower, more management-related set of variables. Most importantly, our study approach shows that it is possible to utilize older biodiversity survey data. Although, in our case, there are strong restrictions due to the long time between species and structural attribute sampling.},

GR-RBPs are bipartite proteins containing a RNA recognition motif (RRM) followed by a glycine-rich region. Here, we studied the structural basis of nucleic acid binding of full-length Nicotiana tabacum GR-RBP1. NMR studies of NtGR-RBP1 show that the glycine-rich domain, while intrinsically disordered, is responsible for mediating self-association by transient interactions with its RRM domain (NtRRM). Both NtGR-RBP1 and NtRRM bind specifically and with low micromolar affinity to RNA and single-stranded DNA. The solution structure of NtRRM shows that it is a canonical RRM domain. A HADDOCK model of the NtRRM-RNA complex, based on NMR chemical shift and NOE data, shows that nucleic acid binding results from a combination of stacking and electrostatic interactions with conserved RRM residues. Finally, DNA melting experiments demonstrate that NtGR-RBP1 is more efficient in melting CTG containing nucleic acids than isolated NtRRM. Together, our study supports the model that self-association of GR-RBPs by the glycine-rich region results in cooperative unfolding of non-native substrate structures, thereby enhancing its chaperone function.},

The lipoplex can penetrate the outer membranes of many cell types, to appear in the cytoplasm encapsulated within endosomes. Escape from the endosome--a key step for transfection--may be controlled by changes in the aggregation behavior of the lipoplex as the pH falls.

We performed a linear mixed-effects growth model analysis (n = 230 with current suicidal ideation at baseline) to assess the course of suicidal ideation over time (baseline through 2-, 4-, 6- and 9-year follow-up). We used logistic regression analysis (n = 195) to test whether factors previously associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation in the literature (insomnia, hopelessness, loneliness, borderline personality traits, childhood trauma, negative life events) also predict persistence of suicidal ideation (i.e., reporting ideation at two consecutive assessment points, 6- and 9-years). We controlled for socio-demographics, clinical diagnosis and severity, medication use, and suicide attempt history. Suicidal ideation decreased over time, and this decrease became slower with increasing time, with the majority of symptom reductions occurring in the first two years of follow-up. More severe insomnia and hopelessness were associated with increased odds of persistent suicidal ideation, and hopelessness was a significant mediator of the relationship between insomnia and persistent suicidal ideation. Findings may not generalize to those with more severe suicidal ideation due to dropout of those with the worst clinical profile. Targeting insomnia and hopelessness in treatment may be particularly important to prevent the persistence of suicidal ideation.},

In this paper we compare different retroviral vector designs for monitoring hypermutation in vivo. Retroviral vectors combine a high transduction rate with integration at random sites within the host cell genome, thus equalizing positional effects on the reporter gene. The vectors contain a reporter gene with a premature TAG termination codon; upon reversion, a full-length fluorescent protein is expressed. Any single point mutation at the amber codon activates the reporter--except the transition from G to A, which only creates the stop codon TAA. In the construct, the reporter gene is followed by an internal ribosome entry site and a second marker that allows selection of stably transduced cells. As a reporter gene, we tested the green and yellow fluorescence proteins (GFP and YFP); and various proteins with red fluorescence (dsRed). The second marker was either a drug resistance gene, or a second fluorescent protein. We also introduced various cis-acting enhancer elements into the reporter construct, to study the simultaneous activity of enhancers on transcription and hypermutation. We found that GFP as a reporter, combined with a drug selection marker, gave the most consistent and convenient mutation rate measurements. DsRed is a good alternative to GFP, but variants with greater fluorescence intensity are needed when combined with green fluorescence measurements. We also confirm that no immunoglobulin specific sequence is needed to target hypermutation. Depending on their position in these ectopically expressed constructs, enhancers can have positive or negative effects on hypermutation.},

However, the question whether perceptual integration of facial and vocal emotions takes place in primary sensory areas, multimodal cortices, or in affective structures remains unanswered yet. Using novel computer-generated stimuli, we combined emotional faces and voices in congruent and incongruent ways and assessed functional brain data (fMRI) during an emotional classification task. Both congruent and incongruent audiovisual stimuli evoked larger responses in thalamus and superior temporal regions compared with unimodal conditions. Congruent emotions were characterized by activation in amygdala, insula, ventral posterior cingulate (vPCC), temporo-occipital, and auditory cortices; incongruent emotions activated a frontoparietal network and bilateral caudate nucleus, indicating a greater processing load in working memory and emotion-encoding areas. The vPCC alone exhibited differential reactions to congruency and incongruency for all emotion categories and can thus be considered a central structure for supramodal representation of complex emotional information. Moreover, the left amygdala reflected supramodal representation of happy stimuli. These findings document that emotional information does not merge at the perceptual audiovisual integration level in unimodal or multimodal areas, but in vPCC and amygdala.},

Flow theory is a well-established model developed to describe subjective game experience.

In accordance with flow theory, we extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii) direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and motivational processes during media entertainment.},

Numerous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions subserving the integration of multimodal emotions and have provided new insights into the neural processing steps underlying the synergistic confluence of affective information from voice and face. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review covering current behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging findings on the combination of emotions from the auditory and visual domains. Behavioral advantages arising from multimodal redundancy are paralleled by specific integration patterns on the neural level, from encoding in early sensory cortices to late cognitive evaluation in higher association areas.

  abstract = {Aggressive behavior is associated with dysfunctions in an affective regulation network encompassing amygdala and prefrontal areas such as orbitofrontal (OFC), anterior cingulate (ACC), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In particular, prefrontal regions have been postulated to control amygdala activity by inhibitory projections, and this process may be disrupted in aggressive individuals. The atypical antipsychotic quetiapine successfully attenuates aggressive behavior in various disorders; the underlying neural processes, however, are unknown. A strengthened functional coupling in the prefrontal-amygdala system may account for these anti-aggressive effects. An inhibition of this network has been reported for virtual aggression in violent video games as well. However, there have been so far no in-vivo observations of pharmacological influences on corticolimbic projections during human aggressive behavior. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, quetiapine and placebo were administered for three successive days prior to an fMRI experiment. In this experiment, functional brain connectivity was assessed during virtual aggressive behavior in a violent video game and an aggression-free control task in a non-violent modification. Quetiapine increased the functional connectivity of ACC and DLPFC with the amygdala during virtual aggression, whereas OFC-amygdala coupling was attenuated. These effects were observed neither for placebo nor for the non-violent control. These results demonstrate for the first time a pharmacological modification of aggression-related human brain networks in a naturalistic setting. The violence-specific modulation of prefrontal-amygdala networks appears to control aggressive behavior and provides a neurobiological model for the anti-aggressive effects of quetiapine.},

  abstract = {Low expressing alleles of the MAOA gene (MAOA-L) have been associated with an increased risk for developing an aggressive personality. This suggests an MAOA-L-specific neurobiological vulnerability associated with trait aggression. The neural networks underlying this vulnerability are unknown. The present study investigated genotype-specific associations between resting state brain networks and trait aggression (Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire) in 82 healthy Caucasian males. Genotype influences on aggression-related networks were studied for intrinsic and seed-based brain connectivity. Intrinsic connectivity was higher in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) of MAOA-L compared to high expressing allele (MAOA-H) carriers. Seed-based connectivity analyses revealed genotype differences in the functional involvement of this region. MAOA genotype modulated the relationship between trait aggression and VMPFC connectivity with supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and areas of the default mode network (DMN). Separate analyses for the two groups were performed to better understand how the genotype modulated the relationship between aggression and brain networks. They revealed a positive correlation between VMPFC connectivity and aggression in right angular gyrus (AG) and a negative correlation in right SMG in the MAOA-L group. No such effect emerged in the MAOA-H carriers. The results indicate a particular relevance of VMPFC for aggression in MAOA-L carriers; in specific, a detachment from the DMN along with a strengthened coupling to the AG seems to go along with lower trait aggression. MAOA-L carriers may thus depend on a synchronization of emotion regulation systems (VMPFC) with core areas of empathy (SMG) to prevent aggression.},

Neuroimaging data were analyzed based on violent and non-violent success and failure events. Correlations with subjective game experience measured brain-behavior and -affect relationships. Results revealed a differential involvement of the striatal reward system: non-violent success elicited activation of the ventral striatum, whereas violent success activated specifically the dorsal striatum. Subjective game experience correlated with putamen and medial prefrontal cortex activation specifically for violent success. These results emphasize a differential neural processing of violent and non-violent success events in dorsal and ventral striatum.

For educators, there are often pragmatic reasons to decide for one or another of them, such as costs, infrastructural requirements, time expenditure or qualification of the teacher. However, a central aspect to consider is the learning outcome: Does a new method achieve a similar learning success as an established standard method? To answer this question, we need an appropriate method to assess comparability of learning outcomes. In this paper, we present two essential statistical concepts that can address the issue of comparability of learning outcomes: Equivalence and non-inferiority testing. We explain the ideas behind these concepts and illustrate them with an example data set. To clarify several concepts, we use theoretical examples from one selected field: the teaching and assessment of Basic Life Support (BLS). Equivalence and non-inferiority tests can be powerful tools for comparing teaching and assessment methods. However, their correct application requires adequate knowledge about their strengths, pitfalls and application fields. The aim of this paper is to deliver this knowledge and to provide clinician researchers with a practical guidance to a successful application of these methods.},

Typical problems arising from either low or exaggerated interspecific morphological differentiation are best met by automated methods of machine learning that learn efficient and effective species identification from training samples. However, limited infraspecific sampling remains a key challenge also in machine learning. In this study, we assessed whether a data augmentation approach may help to overcome the problem of scarce training data in automated visual species identification. The stepwise augmentation of data comprised image rotation as well as visual and virtual augmentation. The visual data augmentation applies classic approaches of data augmentation and generation of artificial images using a generative adversarial networks approach. Descriptive feature vectors are derived from bottleneck features of a VGG-16 convolutional neural network that are then stepwise reduced in dimensionality using Global Average Pooling and principal component analysis to prevent overfitting. Finally, data augmentation employs synthetic additional sampling in feature space by an oversampling algorithm in vector space. Applied on four different image data sets, which include scarab beetle genitalia (Pleophylla, Schizonycha) as well as wing patterns of bees (Osmia) and cattleheart butterflies (Parides), our augmentation approach outperformed a deep learning baseline approach by means of resulting identification accuracy with nonaugmented data as well as a traditional 2D morphometric approach (Procrustes analysis of scarab beetle genitalia).

Since she deteriorated under treatment with inotropes, she was referred to our centre, and veno-arterial extracorporeal life support was started. Subsequently, the aortic valve only opened sporadically, and spontaneous contrast appeared in the left ventricle (LV), pointing towards difficulties with unloading LV. Therefore, an Impella for venting the LV was implanted. After 6 days of mechanical circulatory support, her heart function recovered. All support could be weaned, and 2 months later, she had made a full recovery. We presented a patient with severe cardiogenic shock due to an acute virus-negative lymphocytic myocarditis associated with a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Additional disturbances seem to exist in their sense of body ownership. However, the factors underlying this disturbance in body ownership remain elusive. Knowledge of these factors, and increased understanding of how body ownership is related to other abnormalities seen in schizophrenia, could ultimately advance development of new treatments. Research on body ownership in schizophrenia has mainly been investigated with the rubber hand illusion (RHI). Schizophrenia patients show higher susceptibility to the RHI, which may be explained by a stronger reliance on multisensory information over weaker stored body representations. This review shows that a coherent sense of body ownership arises from the integration of both bottom-up sensory processes and higher order, top-down bodily- and perceptual representations. Multisensory integration, temporal binding, anticipation, intention and efferent signals all partly modulate the complex experience of body ownership. Specifically, we propose that patients with schizophrenia have weaker stored body representations, and rely to a greater extent on external stimuli, such as visual information, due to imprecise or highly variable internal predictions. Moreover, the reduced sense of agency in schizophrenia may additionally contribute to the disturbed sense of body ownership, as evidence from healthy participants suggests that agency and body ownership are interrelated. Vice versa, a reduced sense of body ownership may also contribute to a reduced sense of agency. Future studies should explicitly target the precise relationship between the two in schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {The effects of endocrinological treatment on cardiovascular risk profile in transgender adolescents are unknown. In this retrospective cohort study, we aim to investigate these effects and assess obesity and dyslipidemia prevalence in transgender adolescents at 22 years compared with peers. Changes in BMI, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), glucose, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and lipid values during treatment, along with the prevalence of obesity and dyslipidemia at 22 years, were recorded in 71 transwomen and 121 transmen who started gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists in their adolescence (15 years), with a subsequent addition of sex hormones (17 years). In transwomen, changes in BMI (+3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6 to 4.4), SBP (-2 mm Hg; 95% CI -7 to 3), DBP (+10 mm Hg; 95% CI 7 to 14), glucose (0.0 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.2 to 0.2), HOMA-IR (+0.6; 95% CI -0.6 to 1.9), and lipid values were similar or more favorable compared with peers. The same was true for transmen regarding changes in BMI (+2.3; 95% CI 1.7 to 2.9), SBP (+7 mm Hg; 95% CI 3 to 10), DBP (+7 mm Hg; 95% CI 5 to 10), glucose (+0.1 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.1 to 0.3), HOMA-IR (-0.2; 95% CI -0.8 to 0.3), and lipid values. At age 22, obesity prevalence was 9.9% in transwomen, 6.6% in transmen, 2.2% in ciswomen, and 3.0% in cismen. Generally, endocrinological treatment in transgender adolescents is safe regarding cardiovascular risk. Because obesity is more prevalent in transgender adolescents compared with peers, body weight management should be important during the medical trajectory.},

Evidence suggests an association between exposure to challenging behaviours of individuals with intellectual disabilities and burnout symptoms of staff, but the protective role of staff psychological resources in this relation has been understudied. We investigated the association between exposure to challenging behaviours and burnout symptoms of staff and the direct and moderating effects of several psychological resources. Staff (N = 1271) completed an online survey concerning burnout symptoms (subscale Emotional Exhaustion of the Maslach Burnout Inventory), exposure to challenging behaviours and a range of potential psychological resources. We examined main and moderating effects with multilevel analyses. In order to control for the multiple comparisons, P values corrected for false discovery rate (P We found a direct relation between exposure to challenging behaviours and increased levels of burnout symptoms in staff (b = .15, t(670) = 4.466, P Of the psychological resources found to be associated with reduced risk of burnout symptoms, staff self-efficacy and access of staff to supervisor social support seem to be the factors that can be influenced best. These factors thus may be of importance in reducing the risk of developing burnout symptoms and improving staff well-being, even though the current study was not designed to demonstrate causal relations between psychological resources and burnout symptoms.},

Our aim was to investigate changes in visceral fat and the ratio of visceral fat to total body fat (VAT/TBF) and their associations with changes in lipids and insulin resistance after 1 year of hormone therapy in trans persons. In 179 trans women and 162 trans men, changes in total body and visceral fat estimated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after 1 year of hormone therapy were related to lipids and insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)] with linear regression analysis. In trans women, total body fat increased by 4.0 kg (95% CI 3.4, 4.7), while the amount of visceral fat did not change (-2 grams; 95% CI -15, 11), albeit with a large range from -318 to 281, resulting in a decrease in the VAT/TBF ratio of 17% (95% CI 15, 19). In trans men, total body fat decreased with 2.8 kg (95% CI 2.2, 3.5), while the amount of visceral fat did not change (3 g; 95% CI -10, 16; range -372, 311), increasing the VAT/TBF ratio by 14% (95% CI 10, 17). In both groups, VAT/TBF was not associated with changes in blood lipids or HOMA-IR. Hormone therapy in trans women and trans men resulted in changes in VAT/TBF, mainly due to changes in total body fat and were unrelated to changes in cardiometabolic risk factors, which suggests that any unfavorable cardiometabolic effects of hormone therapy are not mediated by changes in visceral fat or VAT/TBF.},

This research provides an in-depth case study of MAB implementation in South Africa using the Cape Winelands Biosphere Reserve (CWBR), established in 2007 when a key MAB guiding policy, the Madrid Action Plan came into effect. The study utilized semi-structured in-depth interviews with strategic and operational management, and document analysis. The CWBR prioritizes their role as a landscape coordinator, a driver of socio-economic development and site in which humans derive benefits from healthy natural environments. The CWBR have adopted a non-profit organization cooperative governance model in support of this vision, fulfilling the socio-economic development function primarily through successful international partnerships. Challenges faced include a perceived lack of sufficient government support, limited stakeholder awareness and insufficient resources for project implementation. Over reliance on the pillar of their model, the chief executive officer in the current governance form, is an instrument in their effectiveness, yet carries significant risk. These are learnings useful for other biosphere reserves translating an international designation for a local context.},

  abstract = {The digitalisation of the energy domain can bring forth numerous aspects of the energy transition that can boost the emergence of energy citizenship, information sharing, and improved decision-making processes. However, this is premised on citizens being able to make sense of (digital) information. Hence, this paper proposes a link between energy informatics and energy citizenship via energy literacy, considering the cognitive and affective aspects of energy literacy and their relation to behaviour and action. By doing so, this paper aims to understand how the use of energy-related information and social media within five different case studies from the GRETA project can impel energy citizenship. This paper approaches this rationale through different means: (a) structured interviews to understand how citizens understand and make use of energy information within the case studies; (b) topic modelling on the content of those interviews to identify common factors that might spur on hinder behaviour change towards energy citizenship; and (c) social media content analysis to identify key energy-related topics of discussions among citizens around the globe and assess the role of social media as a tool for energy citizenship. As a result, this paper identified some key takeaways to improve the delivery of energy-related information to energy citizens for enhanced energy citizenship. These takeaways allow to conclude that it is fundamental to surpass the formal boundaries of techno-economic constructs and start addressing qualitative/subjective constructs (e.g., emotions, affections, and feelings) to foster energy citizenship. Also, these takeaways could be translated into social mechanism principles in the design of frontend energy-related digital platforms for improved end-user interactions and energy citizenship. Finally, this paper recognised the need to incentivise energy citizens to use social media for consuming energy-related information, and the need to formulate coordinated and coherent response strategies for disseminating energy-related information.},

Inclusion or exclusion of regulatory sequences in the 3'-UTR may ultimately affect gene expression levels. Poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) is involved in polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs. An alanine repeat expansion in PABPN1 (exp-PABPN1) causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). We hypothesized that previously observed disturbed gene expression patterns in OPMD muscles may have been the result of an effect of PABPN1 on alternative polyadenylation, influencing mRNA stability, localization and translation. A single molecule polyadenylation site sequencing method was developed to explore polyadenylation site usage on a genome-wide level in mice overexpressing exp-PABPN1. We identified 2012 transcripts with altered polyadenylation site usage. In the far majority, more proximal alternative polyadenylation sites were used, resulting in shorter 3'-UTRs. 3'-UTR shortening was generally associated with increased expression. Similar changes in polyadenylation site usage were observed after knockdown or overexpression of expanded but not wild-type PABPN1 in cultured myogenic cells. Our data indicate that PABPN1 is important for polyadenylation site selection and that reduced availability of functional PABPN1 in OPMD muscles results in use of alternative polyadenylation sites, leading to large-scale deregulation of gene expression.},

Over the last few decades for example, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated comorbidities. This alarming trend is attributed to the rapid urbanization, increase in income, and unhealthy lifestyles among many others. Most importantly, managing and treating non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is expensive and proving to be beyond the reach of ordinary Africans. Interestingly, Africa has not fully eradicated undernutrition particularly micronutrient malnutrition especially among women and children. Additionally, HIV/AIDs, malaria, diarrheal diseases and other preventable infectious diseases continue to pose serious threat to the health of the populace. The management of NCDs is challenging and costly as most healthcare systems on the continent are largely built for the provision of curative care for communicable diseases. This article proposes the institution of nutrition and health surveys in individual countries to monitor trends. We believe this approach, in addition to addressing lifestyle and behavioral factors, may be effective in curbing the rising phenomenon of obesity and NCDs.},

We initiated a multiinstitutional survey of MR abnormalities in both presumed and confirmed cases of Alexander disease to assess the possibility of an MR-based diagnosis. MR imaging studies in three patients with an autopsy-based diagnosis of Alexander disease were analyzed to define MR criteria for the diagnosis. These criteria were then applied to 217 children with leukoencephalopathy of unknown origin. Five MR imaging criteria were defined: extensive cerebral white matter changes with frontal predominance, a periventricular rim with high signal on T1-weighted images and low signal on T2-weighted images, abnormalities of basal ganglia and thalami, brain stem abnormalities, and contrast enhancement of particular gray and white matter structures. Four of the five criteria had to be met for an MR imaging-based diagnosis. In a retrospective analysis of the MR studies of the 217 patients, 19 were found who fulfilled these criteria. No other essentially new MR abnormalities were found in these patients. In four of the 19 patients, subsequent histologic confirmation was obtained. The clinical symptomatology was the same in the patients with and without histologic confirmation and correlated well with the MR abnormalities. MR abnormalities were in close agreement with the known histopathologic findings of Alexander disease. The defined criteria are sufficient for an in vivo MR imaging diagnosis of Alexander disease; only in atypical cases is a brain biopsy still necessary for a definitive diagnosis.},

The purpose of our ongoing study of the subject was to define new disease entities among them by using primarily MR imaging pattern recognition. We identified seven unrelated patients with a distinct MR imaging pattern consisting of hypomyelination and atrophy of the basal ganglia (neostriatum) and cerebellum (H-ABC). We reviewed the clinical, MR imaging, MR spectroscopic, and laboratory data. Clinically, the patients' diseases were characterized by variably disturbed early development followed by increasing extrapyramidal movement abnormalities, ataxia, and spasticity. Mental capacity was variably affected, but it appeared to be relatively preserved. Parents were not related, and none of their siblings were affected. No metabolic defect was found. Follow-up MR imaging demonstrated atrophy of the cerebral white matter, neostriatum, and cerebellum, which was most pronounced in the most clinically severe cases. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic results were normal in the parietal cortex. In the cerebral white matter, myo-inositol and creatine levels were elevated; this finding was compatible with gliosis. N-acetylaspartate and choline levels were normal, suggesting that neither axonal loss nor active demyelination occurred. Proton MR spectroscopic imaging revealed relatively decreased N-acetylaspartate levels in the frontal region. The uniform and highly characteristic MR imaging findings, in combination with the similarities in the clinical findings, provide evidence of a distinct nosologic entity. The acronym H-ABC is offered to indicate patients sharing these clinical and MR imaging features.},

Some vacuoles were partially covered by multi-lamellar myelin sheaths or oligodendroglial cell extensions. The vacuoles were never found in the middle or inner parts of myelin sheaths, but involved the outermost lamellae of myelin sheaths only, whereas the remainder of the myelin sheaths remained undisturbed. The histopathological findings place the disease among the vacuolating myelinopathies, although it is distinct from the well-known forms. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are splitting of the outermost myelin lamellae at the intraperiod line or a disturbance of compaction of the outermost myelin lamellae at the intraperiod line.},

  abstract = {To provide a practical standard for normal development of gyri and sulci in preterm and term neonates. Thirty-nine living preterm infants without substantial neurologic problems underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain. Five infants who were born at term but died of a nonneurologic disorder within 1 week and who underwent autopsy were examined after death with MR imaging. Seven cerebral surface areas were defined, and the development of gyri and sulci in each area was assigned a score between 1 and 5. The postconceptional age (PCA) range of the newborns was 30-42 weeks. When the gyral development scores were assessed as a function of PCA, four transition points could be discerned for the brain as a whole; these transitions occurred at PCAs of 32, 34, 37, and 40 1/2-41 weeks. These four transition points allowed the general gyral development to be divided into five stages. Development of gyri and sulci was most advanced in the area of the central sulcus and the medical occipital area. Development was latest in the frontobasal and frontopolar areas and the anterior part of the temporal lobe. A simple staging system allows easy assessment of the progress of cerebral gyration and sulcation in preterm and term infants.},

The age range was 3 to 19 years. The onset of the disease was in childhood; the course was both chronic-progressive and episodic. There were episodes of deterioration following infections and minor head traumas, and these could results in unexplained coma. In eight patients with advanced disease, MRI revealed a diffuse cerebral hemispheric leukoencephalopathy, in which increasing areas of the abnormal white matter had a signal intensity close to that of CSF on all pulse sequences. In one patient in the early stages of disease, initial MRI showed diffusely abnormal cerebral white matter, which only reached the signal characteristics of CSF at a later stage. In the patients in whom the disease was advanced, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the white matter showed an almost complete disappearance of all normal signals and the presence of glucose and lactate, compatible with the presence of mainly CSF and little brain tissue. Spectra of the cortex were much better preserved. However, in addition to the normal resonances, there were signals representing lactate and glucose. MRS of the white matter in the patient whose disease was at an early stage was much less abnormal. Autopsy in one patient confirmed the presence of extensive cystic degeneration of the cerebral white matter with reactive change and a preserved cortex. Typical involvement of pontine tegmental white matter was suggested by MRI and confirmed by autopsy. The disease probably has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, but the basic metabolic defect is not known.},

In 4 patients with muscle-eye-brain disease, MRI showed cortical dysplasia, but less severe than in WWS. The cerebral white matter either was normal or contained multiple focal abnormalities. Malformations of posterior fossa structures were present. Eight patients, classified as having classic merosin-deficient CMD (MD-CMD), had diffuse cerebral hemispheric white matter abnormalities, no other abnormalities. One patient with MD-CMD had only a few, focal white matter abnormalities. Three CMD patients had occipital agyria, otherwise normal gyration, multifocal or more diffuse cerebral white matter changes, and variable hypoplasia of pons and vermis. Two of the 3 patients had negative muscle merosin staining. The conclusion of the study is that MRI is an important adjunct in the classification of CMD patients. CMD with occipital agyria can be regarded as a newly recognized, separate CMD subtype.},

The diagnostic criteria used currently for this disease include an early-childhood onset of neurologic deterioration. Clinical, MRI, and spectroscopic findings of five patients were reviewed who fulfilled all inclusion criteria for the disease of vanishing white matter, apart from the age at onset. In one patient histopathologic findings were documented. Onset of the disease was in late childhood or adolescence in four patients, and one patient was still presymptomatic in his early twenties. The course of the disease tended to be milder than in the patients with early-childhood onset. MRI revealed a diffuse cerebral hemispheric leukoencephalopathy with evidence of white matter rarefaction. MRS of the abnormal white matter showed a serious decrease but not complete disappearance of all "normal" signals and, in some patients, the presence of extra signals from lactate and glucose. Changes in relative spectral peak heights were compatible with axonal damage or loss, but not with active demyelination or substantial gliosis. Autopsy in one patient confirmed the extensive rarefaction of the cerebral white matter. There was a commensurate loss of axons and myelin sheaths. Within the brainstem, pontine lesions were present, also involving the central tegmental tracts--a phenomenon previously described in early-onset patients. Later onset does occur in the disease of vanishing white matter, and both MRS and histopathology are compatible with a primary axonopathy rather than primary demyelination.},

Seven major categories were defined according to the predominant location of the white matter abnormalities. Statistical analysis was used to assess the validity of these seven categories. Statistical analysis results showed that the seven categories could be well distinguished by either using the defining variables initially accepted as inclusion criteria or selecting a few other variables found to have discriminating value. The additional variables confirmed that the categories are essentially distinct and vary systematically with regard to items other than the inclusion criteria. The existence of two recently defined leukoencephalopathies was confirmed, but no consistent evidence of other new disease entities could be provided. Establishing these seven categories helps in the interpretation of individual studies by demonstrating features that the patient has in common with other patients, and it may facilitate further research on homogeneous subgroups of patients and allow pooling of data across multiple centers.},

Male moth catches with the 100.1% E-blend only differed from the hexane control in Chile. No apparent differences were noted to these blends in populations collected from pome or stone fruits. Flight tunnel assays to synthetic blends with a subset of populations were similar to the field results, but the breadth of the most attractive E-blends was wider. Flight tunnel assays also demonstrated a high level of male-female cross-attraction among field-collected populations. Female gland extracts from field-collected populations did not show any significant variation in their three-component blends.

R-wave-gated 3D TEE images of the TA were acquired in 39 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The patients with abnormal right ventricular/tricuspid structure or function were excluded from the study. For each patient, eight points along the TA were traced in the 3D dataset and used to reconstruct the TA at four stages of the cardiac cycle (end- and mid-systole, end- and mid-diastole). Statistical analyses were applied to determine whether TA area, perimeter, axes, and planarity changed significantly over each stage of the cardiac cycle. TA area (P = 0.012) and perimeter (P = 0.024) both changed significantly over the cardiac cycle. Of all the axes, only the posterolateral-anteroseptal demonstrated significant dynamism (P < 0.001). There was also a significant displacement in the vertical axis between the points and the regression plane in end-systole (P < 0.001), mid-diastole (P = 0.014), and mid-systole (P < 0.001). The TA demonstrates selective dynamism over the cardiac cycle, and its axis of maximal dynamism is different from the axis (S-L) that is routinely measured with 2D TEE.},

It is unknown how the morphogens patterning the planarian axes are coordinated during feeding and starvation or how they modulate the necessary differential tissue growth or degrowth. Here, we investigate the dynamics of planarian shape together with a theoretical study of the mechanisms regulating whole-body proportions and shape. We found that the planarian body proportions scale isometrically following similar linear rates during growth and degrowth, but that fed worms are significantly wider than starved worms. By combining a descriptive model of planarian shape and size with a mechanistic model of anterior-posterior and medio-lateral signaling calibrated with a novel parameter optimization methodology, we theoretically demonstrate that the feedback loop between these positional information signals and the shape they control can regulate the planarian whole-body shape during growth. Furthermore, the computational model produced the correct shape and size dynamics during degrowth as a result of a predicted increase in apoptosis rate and pole signal during starvation. These results offer mechanistic insights into the dynamic regulation of whole-body morphologies.},

NarE belongs to the family of ADP-ribosyltransferases (ADPRT) and catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose moieties to arginine residues in target protein acceptors. Many pathogenic bacteria utilize ADP-ribosylating toxins to modify and alter essential functions of eukaryotic cells. NarE is further the first ADPRT which could be shown to bind iron through a Fe-S center, which is crucial for the catalytic activity. Here we present the NMR solution structure of NarE, which shows structural homology to other ADPRTs. Using NMR titration experiments we could identify from Chemical Shift Perturbation data both the NAD binding site, which is in perfect agreement with a consensus sequence analysis between different ADPRTs, as well as the iron coordination site, which consists of 2 cysteines and 2 histidines. This atypical iron coordination is also capable to bind zinc. These results could be fortified by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic region, which identified two functionally crucial residues. We could further identify a main interaction region of NarE with antibodies using two complementary methods based on antibody immobilization, proteolytic digestion, and mass spectrometry. This study combines structural and functional features of NarE providing for the first time a characterization of an iron-dependent ADPRT.},

In contrast to previous studies using UV probe pulses, the XUV pulse at 21.7 eV can photoionize all excited states of a molecule, allowing for full relaxation pathways to be addressed after excitation at 4.66 eV. This work was carried out using a gas-dynamic flat liquid jet, resulting in considerably enhanced signal compared to a cylindrical jet. All three species decay on multiple time scales that are assigned based on their decay associated spectra; the fastest decay of ∼100 fs is assigned to ππ* decay to the ground state, while a smaller component with a lifetime of ∼500 fs is attributed to the nπ* state. An additional slower channel in Ade is assigned to the 7H Ade conformer, as seen previously. This work demonstrates the capability of XUV-TRPES to disentangle non-adiabatic dynamics in an aqueous solution in a state-specific manner and represents the first identification of the nπ* state in the relaxation dynamics of adenine and its derivatives.},

  abstract = {Liver transplantation (LT) can be a high transfusion procedure. Frozen plasma (FP) is widely used despite mixed efficacy and safety data. Several centres perform LT with no or low volume of FP by using prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). This systematic review and meta-analysis characterises the existing efficacy and safety data of PCC use in LT. This review was registered (PROSPERO CRD#42024561866). MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to 30 May 2024. Studies in adults undergoing LT where PCC exposure was reported in relation to clinical outcomes were included. Random effects models were used to obtain pooled effect estimates. All studies were retrospective, with seven reporting the number of patients receiving PCC [392/1901 (21%)], and one grouping patients receiving different factor concentrates together [576/939 (61%)]. Patients receiving PCC had worse preoperative coagulopathy, model for end-stage liver disease scores, and comorbidities. Patients exposed to PCC had a comparable mean number of red blood cell (RBC), plasma, or platelet units transfused. Use of viscoelastic testing-based algorithms incorporating PCC compared with usual care was associated with reduced odds of RBC exposure (odds ratio [OR]: 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-0.86, I Although there are no randomised trials comparing use of PCC vs FP in LT, their efficacy and safety appear comparable. Higher-quality studies are needed to assess PCC use for coagulopathic bleeding in LT.},

  abstract = {Many of the genetic childhood disorders leading to death in the pre- or neonatal period or during early childhood follow autosomal recessive modes of inheritance and bear specific challenges for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnostics. Parents are carriers but clinically unaffected, and diseases are rare but have recurrence risks of 25% in the same family. Often, affected children (or fetuses) die before a genetic diagnosis can be established, post-mortem analysis and phenotypic descriptions are insufficient and DNA from affected fetuses or children is not available for later analysis. A genetic diagnosis showing biallelic causative mutations is, however, the requirement for targeted carrier testing in parents and prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis in further pregnancies. We undertook targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) for carrier screening of autosomal recessive lethal disorders in 8 consanguineous and 5 non-consanguineous couples with one or more affected children. We searched for heterozygous variants (non-synonymous coding or splice variants) in parents' DNA, using a set of 430 genes known to be causative for rare autosomal recessive diseases with poor prognosis, and then filtering for variants present in genes overlapping in both partners. Putative pathogenic variants were tested for cosegregation in affected fetuses or children where material was available. The diagnosis for the premature death in children was established in 5 of the 13 couples. Out of the 8 couples in which no causative diagnosis could be established 4 consented to undergo further analysis, in two of those a potentially causative variant in a novel candidate gene was identified. For the families in whom causative variants could be identified, these may now be used for prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnostics. Our data show that NGS based gene panel sequencing of selected genes involved in lethal autosomal recessive disorders is an effective tool for carrier screening in parents and for the identification of recessive gene defects and offers the possibility of prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis in further pregnancies in families that have experienced deaths in early childhood and /or multiple abortions.},

Negative switching RSFPs are switched from the on- to the off-state with the same wavelength that also excites fluorescence. Positive switching RSFPs have a reversed light response, where the fluorescence excitation wavelength induces the transition from the off- to the on-state. Reversible saturable optical linear (fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT) nanoscopy utilizes these switching states to achieve diffraction-unlimited resolution but so far has primarily relied on negative switching RSFPs by using time sequential switching schemes. On the basis of the green fluorescent RSFP Padron, we engineered the positive switching RSFP Padron2. Compared to its predecessor, it can undergo 50-fold more switching cycles while displaying a contrast ratio between the on- and the off-states of more than 100:1. Because of its robust switching behavior, Padron2 supports a RESOLFT imaging scheme that entirely refrains from sequential switching as it only requires beam scanning of two spatially overlaid light distributions. Using Padron2, we demonstrate live-cell RESOLFT nanoscopy without sequential illumination steps.},

RP encompasses a group of hereditary diseases of the posterior segment of the eye characterised by degeneration, atrophy and finally loss of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium, leading to progressive visual loss. Many different mutations affecting different genes can lead to the clinical picture of RP. Even though the disease has a clear genetic background, there are obviously other factors influencing the manifestation and progression of RP. In this review, we focus on the role of OBF. There is evidence that, in PR patients, OBF is more reduced than one would expect secondary to the retinal atrophy. The main cause of this additional component seems to be primary vascular dysregulation (PVD) syndrome. As PVD syndrome is partly treatable, a vascular evaluation of RP patients is meaningful. Based on the outcome, a targeted individualised, preventive or supportive treatment might be introduced in selected RP patients.},

The objective of this survey was to explore regional anaesthesia practices across Europe, including the differences in procedures, use of ultrasound, reporting of complications, guidelines, training and patient safety implementation. A Faculty of European regional anaesthesia experts developed a survey of 27 questions focused on respondent and institution profile, anaesthesia services, patient and safety management, training, use of guidelines, and the implementation of NRFit The survey was disseminated across several European countries via professional networks. There were 794 respondents from 36 European countries. The survey demonstrated that use of regional anaesthesia is growing in Europe and is supported by new technologies. Although some results are consistent with expected trends and applications (e.g. procedures predominantly performed by anaesthesiologists), there are inconsistencies in practice across European countries, especially in the specific regional anaesthesia procedures utilised for different clinical applications and the recording and reporting of regional anaesthesia complications. These inconsistencies also extended to which guidelines are primarily followed and how training is implemented. There were also variations in the general awareness and uptake of the ISO standard for NRFit. The survey results highlight a clear need for standardisation and consistency in the use and management of regional anaesthesia across Europe. The faculty put forth several calls to action that could provide major steps in the right direction towards meeting that goal, including the establishment of European best practices, development of a complication reporting system and implementation of educational programmes to highlight the importance of NRFit.},

Attenuated vasculogenesis and cardiogenesis during recovery were evident at the end of a 12-week follow-up period. Impaired CPC-dependent reparative remodeling ultimately leads to continuous decline of cardiac function in Fn knockout animals. In vitro, Fn protects and induces proliferation of CPCs via β₁-integrin-focal adhesion kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-Pim1 independent of Akt. Fn is essential for endogenous CPC expansion and repair required for stabilization of cardiac function after MI.},

While substantial information has been published on the nature of the fundamental molecular signaling involved in hypertrophy, the role of extracellular matrix protein Fibronectin (Fn) in hypertrophic signaling is unclear. The objective of the study was to delineate the role of Fn during pressure overload-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy and physiological growth prompted by exercise. Genetic conditional ablation of Fn in adulthood blunts cardiomyocyte hypertrophy upon pressure overload via attenuated activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Loss of Fn delays development of heart failure and improves survival. In contrast, genetic deletion of Fn has no impact on physiological cardiac growth induced by voluntary wheel running. Down-regulation of the transcription factor c/EBPβ (Ccaat-enhanced binding protein β), which is essential for induction of the physiological growth program, is unaffected by Fn deletion. Nuclear NFAT translocation is triggered by Fn in conjunction with up-regulation of the fetal gene program and hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes in vitro. Furthermore, activation of the physiological gene program induced by insulin stimulation in vitro is attenuated by Fn, whereas insulin had no impact on Fn-induced pathological growth program. Fn contributes to pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo via NFAT activation. Fn is dispensable for physiological growth in vivo, and Fn attenuates the activation of the physiological growth program in vitro.},

A strong case for posttraumatic cognitions as a change mechanism in PTSD treatment can be made by establishing temporal precedence of change in cognitions. The current study examines the temporal relationship between change in posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD symptoms during PE, using the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory. Patients with DSM-5 defined PTSD following childhood abuse (N = 83) received a maximum of 14-16 sessions of PE. Clinician-rated PTSD symptom severity and posttraumatic cognitions were assessed at baseline, week 4, 8, and 16 (post-treatment). Using time-lagged mixed effect regression models, we found that posttraumatic cognitions predicted subsequent PTSD symptom improvement. Notably, when using the items of an abbreviated version of the PTCI (PTCI-9), we found a mutual relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD symptom improvement. Crucially, the effect of change in cognitions on PTSD symptom change was greater than the reverse effect. The current findings corroborate change in posttraumatic cognitions as a change process during PE, but cognitions and symptoms cannot be completely separated. The PTCI-9 is a short instrument that appears suitable to track cognitive change over time.},

Eighty-six patients with PTSD received 14 to 16 sessions of PE. Using dynamic panel models, we assessed the temporal relation (i.e., within-persons) between in-session distress variability and PTSD symptom decline. Moreover, we assessed the averaged relation (i.e., between-persons) between in-session distress variability and PTSD symptom decline. Temporal analyses showed that in-session distress variability did not precede PTSD symptom improvement. Averaged analyses showed that distress variability was related to PTSD symptom improvement. The operationalization of distress variability appeared to deviate from its theoretical conceptualization. In absence of distress reduction, distress variability can vary. However, our findings suggest that in-session distress variability does not drive symptom reduction during PE. In contrast, averaged over participants, distress variability was related to symptom improvement, suggesting that those with a more variable distress pattern across sessions show better treatment response. More empirical work is needed to shed light on the effect of distress variability during exposure sessions on treatment outcome and to offer grounds for clinical recommendations.},

  abstract = {Flavonoids comprise a large family of secondary plant metabolic intermediates that exhibit a wide variety of antioxidant and human health-related properties. Plant production of flavonoids is limited by the low productivity and the complexity of the recovered flavonoids. Thus to overcome these limitations, metabolic engineering of specific pathway in microbial systems have been envisaged to produce high quantity of a single molecules. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to produce the key intermediate flavonoid, naringenin, solely from glucose. For this, specific naringenin biosynthesis genes from Arabidopsis thaliana were selected by comparative expression profiling and introduced in S. cerevisiae. The sole expression of these A. thaliana genes yielded low extracellular naringenin concentrations (<5.5 μM). To optimize naringenin titers, a yeast chassis strain was developed. Synthesis of aromatic amino acids was deregulated by alleviating feedback inhibition of 3-deoxy-d-arabinose-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (Aro3, Aro4) and byproduct formation was reduced by eliminating phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (Aro10, Pdc5, Pdc6). Together with an increased copy number of the chalcone synthase gene and expression of a heterologous tyrosine ammonia lyase, these modifications resulted in a 40-fold increase of extracellular naringenin titers (to approximately 200 μM) in glucose-grown shake-flask cultures. In aerated, pH controlled batch reactors, extracellular naringenin concentrations of over 400 μM were reached. The results reported in this study demonstrate that S. cerevisiae is capable of de novo production of naringenin by coexpressing the naringenin production genes from A. thaliana and optimization of the flux towards the naringenin pathway. The engineered yeast naringenin production host provides a metabolic chassis for production of a wide range of flavonoids and exploration of their biological functions.},

We hypothesized that the use of CAS optimizes the position of the femoral component and improves PROMs. This is a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of two groups. In the CAS group guiding of the femoral component was done with imageless navigation. In the Conventional (control) group the femoral component was placed manually according to the preplanned position.

Secondary outcome measures consist of the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale (HOOS), the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score. A total of 122 patients were randomized, 61 in the CAS group and 61 in the conventional group. There was no significant differences in accuracy of femoral implant position. The mean difference between the postoperative- and preplanned SSA was - 2.26 and - 1.75 degrees (more varus) respectively in the CAS and Conventional group. After surgery both groups show significant improvement in all PROMs compared to the baseline measurements, with no significant differences between the groups.

While, for example, grammatical dependency relationships in sentences are mainly conveyed by the ordering of the words for languages like Mandarin Chinese, or Vietnamese, the word ordering is much less restricted for languages such as Inupiatun or Quechua, as these languages (also) use the internal structure of words (e.g. inflectional morphology) to mark grammatical relationships in a sentence. Based on a quantitative analysis of more than 1,500 unique translations of different books of the Bible in almost 1,200 different languages that are spoken as a native language by approximately 6 billion people (more than 80% of the world population), we present large-scale evidence for a statistical trade-off between the amount of information conveyed by the ordering of words and the amount of information conveyed by internal word structure: languages that rely more strongly on word order information tend to rely less on word structure information and vice versa. Or put differently, if less information is carried within the word, more information has to be spread among words in order to communicate successfully. In addition, we find that-despite differences in the way information is expressed-there is also evidence for a trade-off between different books of the biblical canon that recurs with little variation across languages: the more informative the word order of the book, the less informative its word structure and vice versa. We argue that this might suggest that, on the one hand, languages encode information in very different (but efficient) ways. On the other hand, content-related and stylistic features are statistically encoded in very similar ways.},

  abstract = {Magnesium shows promising properties concerning its use in absorbable implant applications such as biodegradability, improved mechanical strength and plastic deformability. Following extensive research, the first fixation and compression screws composed of magnesium rare earth alloys were commercialised, notably in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Preclinical and clinical follow-up studies showed that the rapid degradation of unprotected metallic Magnesium surfaces and concomitant hydrogen gas bursts still raise concern regarding certain surgical indications and need to be further improved. In order to enlarge the scope of further applications, the development of future magnesium implants must aim at freedom of design and reduction of volume, hereby enabling higher functionalised implants, as e.g. plate systems or scaffold grafts for bone replacement therapy. In order to overcome the boundaries of conventional manufacturing methods such as turning or milling, the process of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) for magnesium alloys was recently introduced. It enables the production of lattice structures, therefore allowing for reduction of implant material volume. Nevertheless, the concomitant increase of free surface of such magnesium scaffolds further stresses the aforementioned disadvantages of vast degradation and early loss of mechanical stability if not prevented by suitable postprocessing methods. Magnesium scaffold structures with different pore sizes were therefore manufactured by LPBF and consequently further modified either by thermal heat treatment or Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO). Implant performance was assessed by conducting degradation studies and mechanical testing. PEO modified scaffolds with small pore sizes exhibited improved long-term stability, while heat treated specimens showed impaired performance regarding degradation and mechanical stability. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Magnesium based scaffold structures offer wide possibilities for advanced functionalized bioabsorbable implants. By implementing lattice structures, big implant sizes and mechanically optimized implant geometries can be achieved enabling full bone replacement or large-scale plate systems, e.g. for orthopedic applications. As shape optimization and lattice structuring of such scaffolds consequently lead to enlarged surface, suitable design and postprocessing routines come into focus. The presented study addresses these new and relevant topics for the first time by evaluating geometry as well as heat and surface treatment options as input parameters for improved chemical and mechanical stability. The outcome of these variations is measured by degradation tests and mechanical analysis. Evaluating these methods, a significant contribution to the development of absorbable magnesium scaffolds is made. The findings can help to better understand the interdependence of high surface to volume ratio Magnesium implants and to deliver methods to incorporate such lattice structures into future large-scale implant applications manufactured from bioabsorbable Magnesium alloys.},

  abstract = {Bioabsorbable magnesium implants for orthopedic fixation of bone have recently become available for different fields of indication. While general questions of biocompatibility have been answered, tailoring suitable degradation kinetics for specific applications as well as long-term tissue integration remain the focus of current research. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the long-term degradation behavior and osseointegration of Mg-Ca-Zn (ZX00MEO) based magnesium implants with plasma-electrolytic oxidation (PEO) surface modification (ZX00MEO-PEO) in comparison to non-surface modified implants in vivo and in vitro. Besides a general evaluation of the biological performance of the alloy over a prolonged period, the main hypothesis was that PEO surface modification significantly reduces implant degradation rate and improves tissue interaction. In vitro, the microstructure and surface of the bioabsorbable screws were characterized by SEM/EDS, cytocompatibility and degradation testing facilitating hydrogen gas evolution, carried out following ISO 10993-5/-12 and ASTM F3268-18a/ASTM G1-03 (E1:2017). In vivo, screws were implanted in the frontal bone of Minipigs for 6, 12, and 18 months, following radiological and histomorphometric analysis. A slower and more uniform degradation and improved cytocompatibility could be shown for the ZX00MEO-PEO group in vitro. A significant reduction of degradation rate and enhanced bone formation around the ZX00MEO-PEO screws in vivo was confirmed. Proficient biocompatibility and tissue integration could generally be shown in vivo regardless of surface state. The tested magnesium alloy shows generally beneficial properties as an implant material, while PEO-surface modification further improves the bioabsorption behavior both in vitro and in vivo. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Devices from bioabsorbable Magnesium have recently been introduced to orthopedic applications. However, the vast degradation of Magnesium within the human body still gives limitations. While reliable in-vivo data on most promising surface treatments such as Plasma-electrolytic-Oxidation is generally scarce, long-time results in large animals are to this date completely missing. To overcome this lack of evidence, we studied a Magnesium-Calzium-Zinc-alloy with surface enhancement by PEO for the first time ever over a period of 18 months in a large animal model. In-vitro, surface-modified screws showed significantly improved cytocompatibility and reduction of degradation confirmed by hydrogen gas evolution testing, while in-vivo radiological and histological evaluation generally showed good biocompatibility and bioabsorption as well as significantly enhanced reduction of degradation and faster bone regeneration in the PEO-surface-modified group.},

Recommendations and tools exist to aid implementation groups in selecting TMFs, but they do not explicitly outline a systematic method for identifying and selecting TMFs. This paper aimed to (1) propose a systematic consensus-based method to select TMFs to support implementation processes, and to (2) demonstrate the use of this novel method in the context of researching the implementation of hip protectors for fracture prevention in long-term care (LTC). We developed a systematic, consensus-based method for selecting TMFs, referred to as the Implementation Theory Selection Model (ITSM). The ITSM comprises five steps: (1) identify potentially relevant TMFs; (2) narrow the pool of TMFs; (3) appraise the relevance of eligible TMFs; (4) prioritize a short-list of TMFs for further, in-depth consideration; and (5) select TMFs through consensus with investigators and research user partners. We operationalized each step of the ITSM through a project investigating determinants of hip protector use and organizational readiness for implementation in a LTC organization in Ontario, Canada. Using the ITSM in our case example, we identified 66 TMFs (Step 1). Of these, 23 met our eligibility criteria (Step 2) and were appraised twice, by five appraisers (Step 3). Six TMFs (Step 4) advanced to the consensus meeting, which was attended by nine investigators and three research users, including two organizational partners and one older adult. Three rounds of voting yielded a tie between the TMFs the group felt would be most appropriate. Research users from our partner LTC organization made the final selection preferring the combination of the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Step 5). The ITSM offers a step-by-step guide for implementation groups to adopt a rigorous, transparent and reproducible method for TMF selection. Although we have demonstrated the feasibility of operationalizing each step of the ITSM in our case example, continued research is needed to evaluate and refine the ITSM to ensure it is appropriate for a wide variety of implementation contexts.},

In the present study, the inflammatory tissue responses to a novel high-density PTFE (dPTFE) barrier membrane have preclinically been evaluated using the subcutaneous implantation model in BALB/c mice by means of histopathological and histomorphometrical analysis methods and immunohistochemical detection of M1- and M2-macrophages. A collagen membrane was used as the control material. The results of the present study demonstrate that the tissue response to the dPTFE membrane involves inflammatory macrophages, but comparable cell numbers were also detected in the implant beds of the control collagen membrane, which is known to be biocompatible. Although these data indicate that the analyzed dPTFE membrane is not fully bioinert, but its biocompatibility is comparable to collagen-based membranes. Based on its optimal biocompatibility, the novel dPTFE barrier membrane may optimally support bone healing within the context of guided bone regeneration (GBR).},

However, hardly any literature comparing the new protocols for PRF (the A-PRF+ and i-PRF) with the original protocol of PRF (L-PRF) is present for osteoblast-like cells. A-PRF+, L-PRF, and i-PRF were prepared from six male donors and pre-cultured with 10 mL culture medium for 6 days. 5 x 10 In osteoblast-like cells cultured with conditioned medium, the A-PRF+ conditioned medium induced more mineralization and calcium production after 28 days of culturing compared with the control (p < .05). No significant differences were found in the extent of cell proliferation between the different conditions. RUNX-2 and osteonectin mRNA expression in the cells were lower in all PRF-stimulated cultures compared with control at different time points. The i-PRF-conditioned medium induced more ALP activity (p < .05) compared with control and osteoblasts-like cells differentiated more compared with osteoblasts cultured with L-PRF. The three PRF preparations seem to have the capacity to increase the osteogenic potential of osteoblast-like cells. A-PRF+ seems to have the highest potential for mineralization, while i-PRF seems to have the potential to enhance early cell differentiation.},

A quantitative survey of postgraduate courses in emergency medicine, critical care medicine, and hematology was conducted from November 2022 to March 2023. Possible factors influencing attitudes towards PAS were analyzed. A total of 1163 records (response rate 82.1%) were analyzed. Of the participants, 90.8% had experience with dying patients, 62.3% supported PAS only in palliative scenarios, 20.1% supported PAS regardless of the health status, 33.1% have been asked for PAS, and 3.3% had participated in PAS. In addition, 71.0% did not know the content of the Federal Constitutional Court's decision on § 217, 72.0% were not informed about the legislative proposals for the new regulation of PAS, and 66.4% saw doctors as the right person to decide whether a suicidal wish is permissible. Younger doctors differentiate in their attitude towards PAS between people without illnesses and those in palliative treatment situations. Further investigations into the causes of the frequent ignorance of the normative foundations are necessary. The results suggest that more educational work needs to be done about suicide alternatives and palliative care options.},

The aim of this study was to conduct our investigation to assess the hepatoprotective effects of melatonin in rats treated with gentamicin. Forty eight adult male Wistar rats were used. The animals were randomly distributed into six groups of equal size. During the period of 11 days, three control groups of rats were daily injected i.p. with the vehicle or with melatonin at a dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg. The gentamicin group was injected with gentamicin at a dose of 80 mg/kg during 8 days and vehicle for 11 days. The other two experimental groups were administered gentamicin (80 mg/kg during) 8 days and melatonin (doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg) 3 days before and 8 days concomitantly with melatonin. Obtained liver sections were analyzed using qualitative, semi-quantitative, and stereological analysis. Gentamicin expressed hepatotoxic effects inducing congestion of lobular blood vessels, hydropic degeneration of periportal hepatocytes and mononuclear infiltration in the portal tract. Treatment with gentamicin resulted in an increase in the Vv of blood vessels, a decrease in the Vv of hepatocytes, and a decrease in the glycogen content in all three lobular zones. Melatonin administration reduced the liver alterations induced by gentamicin; the higher dose had a more potent protective effect. Melatonin has a beneficial effect on gentamicin-induced liver damage and the effect is dose-dependent.},

  abstract = {In nature, some proteins partially unfold under specific environmental conditions. These unfolded states typically consist of a large ensemble of conformations; their proper description is therefore a challenging problem. NMR spectroscopy is particularly well suited for this task: information on conformational preferences can be derived, for example, from chemical shifts or residual dipolar couplings. This information, which is measured as a time- and ensemble-average, can be used to model these states by generating large ensembles of conformations. The challenge is then to select a minimum representative set of conformations out of a large ensemble to represent the unfolded state. We have developed for this purpose an algorithm called MINOES (MINimum Optimal Ensemble Selection), which is based on an iterative procedure based on a driven expansion/contraction selection process. MINOES aims at selecting an optimal and minimal ensemble of conformations that, on average, maximizes the agreement between back-calculated and experimental (NMR) data, without any a-priori assumption about the required ensemble size. This approach is demonstrated by modeling the partially unfolded state of a deletion mutant of the Photoactive Yellow Protein, Delta25-PYP, which has been previously characterized by NMR (Bernard et al., Structure 2005;13:953-962).},

In the last two cases, a part of the protein is affected either by binding or unfolding and the detection of the respective perturbed and unperturbed region(s) is a fundamental part of the structural characterization of these states. This can be achieved by comparing experimental data of the same protein in two different states (bound/unbound, folded/unfolded). For instance, measurements of chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) from NMR 1H-15N HSQC experiments gives an excellent opportunity to discriminate both moieties. We describe an innovative, automatic and unbiased method to distinguish perturbed and unperturbed regions in a protein existing in two distinct states (folded/partially unfolded, bound/unbound). The SAMPLEX program takes as input a set of data and the corresponding three-dimensional structure and returns the confidence for each residue to be in a perturbed or unperturbed state. Its performance is demonstrated for different applications including the prediction of disordered regions in partially unfolded proteins and of interacting regions in protein complexes. The proposed approach is suitable for partially unfolded states of proteins, local perturbations due to small ligands and protein-protein interfaces. The method is not restricted to NMR data, but is generic and can be applied to a wide variety of information.},

  abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder that may develop after a traumatic event. Here we aimed to identify epigenetic and genetic loci associated with PTSD. We included 73 traumatized police officers with extreme phenotypes regarding symptom severity despite similar trauma history: n = 34 had PTSD and n = 39 had minimal PTSD symptoms. Epigenetic and genetic profiles were based on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. We searched for differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). For genetic associations we analyzed the CpG-SNPs present on the array. We detected no genome-wide significant DMPs and we did not replicate previously reported DMPs associated with PTSD. However, GSE analysis of the top 100 DMPs showed enrichment of three genes involved in the dopaminergic neurogenesis pathway. Furthermore, we observed a suggestive association of one relatively large DMR between patients and controls, which was located at the PAX8 gene and previously associated with other psychiatric disorders. Finally, we validated five PTSD-associated CpG-SNPs identified with the array using sanger sequencing. We subsequently replicated the association of one common SNP (rs1990322) in the CACNA1C locus with PTSD in an independent cohort of traumatized children. The CACNA1C locus was previously associated with other psychiatric disorders, but not yet with PTSD. Thus, despite the small sample size, inclusion of extreme symptom severity phenotypes in a highly homogenous traumatized cohort enabled detection of epigenetic and genetic loci associated with PTSD. Moreover, here we showed that genetically confounded 450K probes are informative for genetic association analysis.},

The molecular confirmation of this syndrome is possible in approximately 85% of the cases, whereas in the remaining 15% of the cases, the underlying defect remains unclear. The goal of our research was to identify new epigenetic loci related to BWS. We studied a group of 25 patients clinically diagnosed with BWS but without molecular conformation after DNA diagnostics and performed a whole genome methylation analysis using the HumanMethylation450 Array (Illumina).We found hypermethylation throughout the methylome in two BWS patients. The hypermethylated sites in these patients overlapped and included both non-imprinted and imprinted regions. This finding was not previously described in any BWS-diagnosed patient.Furthermore, one BWS patient exhibited aberrant methylation in four maternally methylated regions-IGF1R, NHP2L1, L3MBTL, and ZDBF2-that overlapped with the differentially methylated regions found in BWS patients with multi-locus imprinting disturbance (MLID). This finding suggests that the BWS phenotype can result from MLID without detectable methylation defects in the primarily disease-associated loci (11p15). Another patient manifested small but significant aberrant methylation in disease-associated loci at 11p near H19, possibly confirming the diagnosis in this patient.},

However, obtained results weaken after time, possibly necessitating repeat procedures. Given the palliative nature of this procedure, potential for iatrogenic damage should be kept at a minimum. So, in order to minimize invasiveness while optimizing repeatability, we sought to create an easily reproducible single-access port operative strategy. Four patients suffering from intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis for >10 years (12.8 ± 5.9) underwent a single-port unilateral R5-R11 splanchnotomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. No operative complications were observed. All 4 patients experienced excellent pain relief with a significant improvement of Visual Analogue Scale pain scores (8.8 ± 1.0 preoperatively to 3.0 ± 1.2 postoperatively, P = 0.003). We report the first series of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) splanchnotomy for palliation of intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis.

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of an electronic learning (e-learning) module on the adherence to suicide prevention guidelines, knowledge of practical skills, and provider's confidence to have a conversation about suicidal behavior with undergraduate psychology students. The e-learning module, comprising video recordings of therapist-patient interactions, was designed with the aim of transferring knowledge about suicide prevention guideline recommendations. The program's effects on guideline adherence, self-evaluated knowledge, and provider's confidence were assessed using online questionnaires before the program (baseline and at 1 month [T1] and 3 months after baseline). The eligible third- and fourth-year undergraduate psychology students were randomly allocated to the e-learning (n=211) or to a waitlist control condition (n=187), with access to the intervention after T1. Overall, the students evaluated e-learning in a fairly positive manner. The intention-to-treat analysis showed that the students in the intervention condition (n=211) reported higher levels of self-evaluated knowledge, provider's confidence, and guideline adherence than those in the waitlist control condition (n=187) after receiving the e-learning module (all P values<.001). When comparing the scores at the 1- and 3-month follow-up, after both groups had received access to the e-learning module, the completers-only analysis showed that the levels of knowledge, guideline adherence, and confidence remained constant (all P values>.05) within the intervention group, whereas a significant improvement was observed in the waitlist control group (all P values<.05). An e-learning intervention on suicide prevention could be an effective first step toward improved knowledge of clinical skills. The learning outcomes of a stand-alone module were found to be similar to those of a training that combined e-learning with a face-to-face training, with the advantages of flexibility and low costs.},

Previous developments of apps for occupational stress have not yet fully exploited the potential of multilevel diagnostics through the integration of wearable sensors for interventions. Personalizing mHealth approaches in terms of intervention time and content, which requires the use of artificial intelligence, is the next logical developmental step. The "Relax" approach developed a corresponding prototype of an app-wearable system, which will be evaluated for effectiveness in terms of stress reduction and usability. This study protocol describes an evaluation study used to test the effectiveness and usability of the Relax approach. The evaluation study was designed as a 2-arm randomized trial with 2 phases, each with a 3-week intervention period. In both phases, employees were required to use the app to record daily stress and to wear a wearable sensor to measure heart rate variability. The app offered interventions based on algorithms, which altered the probability of their selection after learning from the data, thereby personalizing the user experience. In the second phase of the study, the sample was divided into 2 groups, varying the degree of personalization of the app. To analyze effectiveness, a 2-factorial mixed within-between design will be applied to compare the outcomes between both groups as well as in a pre-post comparison. In addition, exploratory analyses of the usability of the approach are planned. The study was conducted during the spring and summer of 2024, with a total of 46 participants enrolled, and is ready for data analysis. The Relax approach, including a number of factors related to personalization that have not yet been incorporated into mHealth in current research, will provide new insights into the next steps of advanced mHealth solutions. Limitations of the study design, such as the lack of a control group and the sample representativity, have to be addressed. Open Science Foundation 10.17605/OSF.IO/MYRD9; https://osf.io/myrd9.

Transcription of both genes would therefore favour the formation of double-stranded RNA, providing a substrate for the RNAi machinery, and enhanced antisense transcription should therefore reduce sense transcript levels. We have identified a gene pair that resembles a model for antisense-based gene regulation as a T-DNA insertion into the antisense gene causes a reduction in antisense transcript levels and an increase in sense transcript levels. The same effect was, however, also observed when the two genes were inserted as transgenes into different chromosomal locations, independent of the sense and antisense gene being expressed individually or jointly. Our results therefore indicate that antagonistic changes in sense/antisense transcript levels do not necessarily reflect antisense-mediated regulation. More likely, the partial overlap of the two genes may have favoured the evolution of antagonistic expression patterns preventing RNAi effects.},

The role and consequences of reirradiation remain unclear, particularly in terms of survival. The objective was to study overall survival (OS) and neurological death-free survival (NDFS) and to specify the prognostic factors of long-term survival. we retrospectively reviewed the data of patients treated between 2010 and 2020 with at least two courses of SRT without previous WBRT. In total, 184 patients were treated for 915 BMs with two-to-six SRT sessions. Additional SRT sessions were provided for local (5.6%) or distant (94.4%) BM recurrence. The median number of BMs treated per SRT was one with a median of four BMs in total. The mean time between the two SRT sessions was 8.9 months (95%CI 7.7-10.1) and there was no significant difference in the delay between the two sessions. The 6-, 12- and 24-month NDFS rates were 97%, 82% and 52%, respectively. The 6-, 12- and 24-month OS rates were 91%, 70% and 38%, respectively. OS was statistically related to the number of SRT sessions (HR = 0.48;  Lung cancer and melanoma were associated with a lower NDFS compared to breast cancer. A low KPS, a low number of SRT sessions, synchronous extracerebral metastases, synchronous BMs, extracerebral progression at SRT1, a high BMV grade, no WBRT and local recurrence were also associated with a lower NDFS. A high KPS at SRT1 and low BMV grade are prognostic factors for better OS, regardless of the number of BM recurrence events.},

DHG-H3G34R further harbor deactivation of alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked protein (ATRX; DHG-H3G34R_ATRX) suggesting a unique interaction of these 2 oncogenic alterations. In this study, we dissect their cell biological interplay, investigate the impact on telomere stabilization, and consequently validate a targeted therapy approach. We characterized patient-derived primary pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) models for telomere-maintenance mechanisms, DNA damage stress (including protein expression, pH2AX/Rad51 foci, cell-cycle arrest) and their sensitivity towards poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) combinations. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) were used for modeling the disease. The anticancer activity of PARPi combinations in vivo was studied in Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) and orthotopic in vivo experiments. Finally, we treated a DHG-H3G34R_ATRX patient with PARPi combination therapy. We elaborate that alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a key characteristic of DHG-H3G34R_ATRX. A dominant cooperative effect between H3G34R and ATRX loss in ALT activation also became apparent in iPSCs, which endogenously exert telomerase activity. In both, patient-derived DHG-H3G34R_ATRX models and H3G34R+/ATRX- iPSCs, the ALT-phenotype was associated with increased basal DNA damage stress, mediating synergistic susceptibility towards PARPi (talazoparib, niraparib) combinations with topoisomerase-I inhibitors (topotecan, irinotecan). In a first-of-its-kind case, treatment of a DHG-H3G34R_ATRX patient with the brain-penetrant PARP inhibitor niraparib and topotecan resulted in significant tumor reduction.

  abstract = {The abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is associated with organ dysfunction and mortality in critically ill patients. Furthermore, the deleterious effects of increased IAP have been shown to occur at levels of intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) previously deemed to be safe. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of all aspects of this underrecognized pathological syndrome for surgeons. This review article will focus primarily on the recent literature on ACS as well as the definitions and recommendations published by the World Society for the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. The definitions regarding increased IAP will be listed, followed by a brief but comprehensive overview of the different mechanisms of organ dysfunction associated with intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Measurement techniques for IAP will be discussed, as well as recommendations for organ function support in patients with IAH. Finally, surgical treatment and management of the open abdomen are briefly discussed, as well as some minimally invasive techniques to decrease IAP. The ACS was first described in surgical patients with abdominal trauma, bleeding, or infection, but in recent years ACS has also been described in patients with other pathologies such as burn injury and sepsis. Some of these so-called nonsurgical patients will require surgery to treat their ACS. This review article is intended to provide surgeons with a clear insight into the current state of knowledge regarding IAH, ACS, and the impact of IAP on the critically ill patient.},

  abstract = {Chest compression (CC) research primarily focuses on finding the 'optimum' compression waveform using a variety of compression efficacy metrics. Blood flow is rarely measured systematically with high fidelity. Using a programmable mechanical chest compression device, we studied the effect of inter-compression pauses in a swine model of cardiac arrest, testing the hypothesis that a single 'optimal' CC waveform exists based on measurements of resulting blood flow. Hemodynamics were studied in 9 domestic swine (∼30 kg) using multiple flow probes and standard physiological monitoring. After 10 min of ventricular fibrillation, five mechanical chest compression waveforms (5.1 cm, varying inter-compression pauses) were delivered for 2 min each in a semi-random pattern, totaling 50 compression minutes. Linear Mixed Models were used to estimate the effect of compression waveform on hemodynamics. Blood flow and pressure decayed significantly with time in both arteries and veins. No waveform maximized blood flow in all vessels simultaneously and the waveform generating maximal blood flow in a specific vessel changed over time in all vessels. A flow mismatch between paired arteries and veins, e.g. abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, also developed over time. The waveform with the slowest rate and shortest duty cycle had the smallest mismatch between flows after about 30 min of CPR. This data challenges the concept of a single optimal CC waveform. Time dependent physiological response to compressions and no single compression waveform optimizing flow in all vessels indicate that current descriptions of CPR don't reflect patient physiology.},

A total of 165 prospectively enrolled patients who underwent volar plating for an intra-articular distal radial fracture were retrospectively evaluated to study three intraoperative imaging protocols: 1) standard 2D fluoroscopic imaging with anteroposterior (AP) and elevated lateral images (n = 55); 2) 2D fluoroscopic imaging with AP, lateral, and dorsal tangential views images (n = 50); and 3) 3D fluoroscopy (n = 60). Multiplanar reconstructions of postoperative CT scans served as the reference standard. In order to detect dorsal screw penetration, the sensitivity of dorsal tangential views was 39% with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 91% and an accuracy of 91%; compared with a sensitivity of 25% for 3D fluoroscopy with a NPV of 93% and an accuracy of 93%. On the postoperative CT scans, we found penetrating screws in: 1) 40% of patients in the 2D fluoroscopy group; 2) in 32% of those in the 2D fluoroscopy group with AP, lateral, and dorsal tangential views; and 3) in 25% of patients in the 3D fluoroscopy group. In all three groups, the second compartment was prone to penetration, while the postoperative incidence decreased when more advanced imaging was used. There were no penetrating screws in the third compartment (extensor pollicis longus groove) in the 3D fluoroscopy groups, and one in the dorsal tangential views group. Advanced intraoperative imaging helps to identify screws which have penetrated the dorsal compartments of the wrist. However, based on diagnostic performance characteristics, one cannot conclude that 3D fluoroscopy outperforms dorsal tangential views when used for this purpose. Dorsal tangential views are sufficiently accurate to detect dorsal screw penetration, and arguably more efficacious than 3D fluoroscopy. Cite this article: },

Extracorporeal life support seems an efficient therapy for acute, potentially reversible cardiac or respiratory failure, when conventional therapy has been inadequate, or as bridge to transplant, but unfortunately, no evidence in randomized controlled trials is delivered yet. Single-center retrospective exploratory cohort cost study. The study is performed from a hospital perspective with a time horizon of patients' complete hospital admission in which they received extracorporeal life support. ICU of a university teaching hospital in The Netherlands. All 67 consecutive adult patients who were admitted to the ICU of the University Medical Center Groningen in the period 2010-2013 and received extracorporeal life support treatment. None. The bottom-up microcosting method was used except when stated otherwise. Medical costs were estimated by multiplying every registered healthcare consumption with unit prices. Unit prices were largely based on Dutch reference prices. For each patient, the personnel costs and material costs were assessed in detail. The costs of extracorporeal life support were differentiated in costs of procedures and costs of daily surcharge of therapy. Procedure-related costs were subdivided in costs of devices and disposables, costs of additional human resources, and surgery hours. The mean total hospital costs were € 106.263 (€ 83.841 to € 126.266) per patient ($145,580). On average, 52% of the total costs arose from hospital nursing days and 11% of direct procedure-related extracorporeal life support costs. Surgery and diagnostics represented a vast amount of the remaining costs. This large and detailed economic evaluation of hospital costs of extracorporeal life support therapy in the Netherlands showed that mean total hospital cost of extracorporeal life support treatment is € 106.263 per patient. The majority of the costs are composed of nursing days.},

Recent studies demonstrate that manipulation of these co-inhibitory pathways can remove the immunological brakes that impede endogenous immune responses against tumours. Antibodies that block the interactions between co-inhibitory receptors and their ligands have delivered very promising clinical responses, as has been shown by recent successful trials targeting the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of action and expression pattern of co-inhibitory receptors on different T cells subsets, emphasising differences between CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells.

  abstract = {Maclurin is a phenolic compound extracted from purple mangosteen and mulberry twigs. Earlier reports indicated that it exerts antioxidant activity. We hypothesized that maclurin exerts antioxidant activity and anti-cancer effects in small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (SCNCs), a very aggressive type of human prostate cancer. To verify our hypothesis, we selected PC3 cells as a model system and investigated the antioxidant activity and anti-cancer effects of maclurin. In the reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection assay for the verification of antioxidant activity, we observed the unexpected prooxidant activity of maclurin in PC3 cells. For the anti-cancer activities, we investigated the effects of maclurin on induction of apoptosis and inhibition of metastatic characteristics of PC3 cells. In the apoptosis assay, maclurin significantly induced apoptosis of PC3 cells. Maclurin also showed significant anti-metastatic effects. Maclurin inhibited cell migration in a dosage-dependent manner. In addition, the gelatin zymography assay indicated that maclurin inhibited activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) that affect cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Then, we investigated the effects of maclurin on the cancer-related signaling molecules. Maclurin activated p38 signaling and inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), focal-adhesion kinase (FAK), AKT, and c-Myc signalings in PC3 cells. Finally, we observed prooxidant activity and anti-SCNC effects of maclurin in DU145 cells. This suggests that the effects of maclurin may not be specifically limited to PC3 cells. Our findings suggest that maclurin exerts anti-cancer effects on SCNC cells via activation of p38 and inhibitions of JNK, FAK, AKT and c-Myc signalings.},

We studied the effect of the rs72824905-G on seven neurodegenerative diseases and longevity, using 53,627 patients, 3,516 long-lived individuals and 149,290 study-matched controls. We replicated the association of rs72824905-G with reduced AD risk and we found an association with reduced risk of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We did not find evidence for an effect on Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and multiple sclerosis (MS) risks, despite adequate sample sizes. Conversely, the rs72824905-G allele was associated with increased likelihood of longevity. By-proxy analyses in the UK Biobank supported the associations with both dementia and longevity. Concluding, rs72824905-G has a protective effect against multiple neurodegenerative diseases indicating shared aspects of disease etiology.

Here we show that the levels of an N-terminal proteolytically derived fragment of HDAC4, termed HDAC4-NT, are lower in failing mouse hearts than in healthy control hearts. Virus-mediated transfer of the portion of the Hdac4 gene encoding HDAC4-NT into the mouse myocardium protected the heart from remodeling and failure; this was associated with decreased expression of Nr4a1, which encodes a nuclear orphan receptor, and decreased NR4A1-dependent activation of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Conversely, exercise enhanced HDAC4-NT levels, and mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Hdac4 show reduced exercise capacity, which was characterized by cardiac fatigue and increased expression of Nr4a1. Mechanistically, we found that NR4A1 negatively regulated contractile function in a manner that depended on the HBP and the calcium sensor STIM1. Our work describes a new regulatory axis in which epigenetic regulation of a metabolic pathway affects calcium handling. Activation of this axis during intermittent physiological stress promotes cardiac function, whereas its impairment in sustained pathological cardiac stress leads to heart failure.},

Residents assigned to the intervention group were paired with a tutor, and time slots were scheduled for bedside direct supervision over the following 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of residents who successfully completed at least 25 POCUS examinations six months after inclusion. Secondary outcomes included self- and blinded-expert-assessed POCUS competency skills. Between January and May 2022, 23 residents were included in the study. The intervention significantly increased the proportion of participants reaching the primary outcome (70% versus 0%; p < 0.001) with a median of 27 (interquartile range, IQR, 6 to 44) supervised examinations performed versus 0 (IQR 0 to 0) in intervention and control arm respectively; p < 0.001. After 6 months, proficiency was higher for most heart imaging but not for lung imaging, as assessed through self-assessment by participants or independently by blinded experts. Structured POCUS supervision significantly enhances the number of POCUS examinations and proficiency at 6-months, particularly in applications requiring greater visuospatial skills.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to describe MR imaging features of an unusual type of meniscal cyst arising from tears of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus in 10 patients. Retrospective review of MR examinations of the knee was performed of 10 patients (nine men, one woman; mean age, 39 years) in whom evidence of a meniscal tear and a cyst-like structure around the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was seen. An oval mass with low signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images posterior to the PCL, simulating a PCL ganglion cyst, was seen in all 10 patients. A tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus was also seen in all patients. The sites of communication between the cyst and meniscal tear were observed in sagittal MR images in eight patients. Septation within the cyst and associated joint effusion were seen in eight and four patients, respectively. Arthroscopy in eight patients and transmeniscal needle drainage in the other two patients confirmed both the meniscal tear and the pericruciate meniscal cyst. Pericruciate meniscal cysts cause fluid collections posterior to the PCL, simulating a PCL ganglion cyst. Careful analysis of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus should be performed when a cyst-like structure is seen adjacent to the PCL.},

Platelet-bound immunoglobulins were demonstrated by immunofluorescence in all 16 patients with AIDS, in five out of seven patients with AIDS-related complex/persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (ARC/PGL) and even in seven of 10 healthy sexually active homosexual men. Granulocyte-bound immunoglobulins were found by immunofluorescence in 12 of the 16 AIDS patients, five of the seven patients with ARC/PGL and two of the 10 symptomless men. Red cell bound immunoglobulins were not detected. All patients with AIDS and ARC/PGL and three of the symptomless men were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The platelet- and granulocyte-bound immunoglobulins could be eluted in 93% and 67% of the cases, respectively. This indicates that specific autoantibodies, rather than circulating immune complexes, which were frequently increased, accounted for the findings. There was no relation between the serological findings and the platelet and granulocyte counts. We conclude that autoantibodies against platelets and granulocytes are common in patients with AIDS and those at risk.},

  abstract = {Advancement of ultrasound molecular imaging applications requires not only a reduction in size of the ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) but also a significant improvement in the in vivo stability of the shell-stabilized gas bubble. The transition from first generation to second generation UCAs was marked by an advancement in stability as air was replaced by a hydrophobic gas, such as perfluoropropane and sulfur hexafluoride. Further improvement can be realized by focusing on how well the UCAs shell can retain the encapsulated gas under extreme mechanical deformations. Here we report the next generation of UCAs for which we engineered the shell structure to impart much better stability under repeated prolonged oscillation due to ultrasound, and large changes in shear and turbulence as it circulates within the body. By adapting an architecture with two layers of contrasting elastic properties similar to bacterial cell envelopes, our ultrastable nanobubbles (NBs) withstand continuous in vitro exposure to ultrasound with minimal signal decay and have a significant delay on the onset of in vivo signal decay in kidney, liver, and tumor. Development of ultrastable NBs can potentially expand the role of ultrasound in molecular imaging, theranostics, and drug delivery.},

Although the pathophysiology is well understood, cases involving the concurrent use of other medications are less explored. We present a unique case of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema in a 57-year-old male, which developed soon after receiving intravenous contrast. The patient's medication list included a dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitor and a calcium channel blocker. Studies have shown an increased risk of angioedema with the combined use of these medications, likely due to alterations in bradykinin metabolism. This case highlights the importance of medication review and consideration of potential drug interactions when prescribing ACE inhibitors. It emphasizes the significance of diagnostic accuracy to avoid the mislabeling of allergies and consideration of other etiologies in angioedema. Healthcare providers ought to be mindful of the increased risk of angioedema when prescribing dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors and calcium-channel blockers with ACE inhibitors, as these are frequently used medications.},

We conducted a phase 2 trial in 139 patients aged 18 to 64 years who had primary DLBCL with an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI) score of 2 to 3 or site-specific risk factors for CNS recurrence. The goal was to assess whether a dose-dense immunochemotherapy with early systemic CNS prophylaxis improves the outcome and reduces the incidence of CNS events. Treatment consisted of 2 courses of high-dose methotrexate in combination with biweekly rituximab (R), cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP-14), followed by 4 courses of R-CHOP-14 with etoposide (R-CHOEP) and 1 course of high-dose cytarabine with R. In addition, liposomal cytarabine was administered intrathecally at courses 1, 3, and 5. Coprimary endpoints were failure-free survival and CNS progression rates. Thirty-six (26%) patients experienced treatment failure. Progression occurred in 23 (16%) patients, including three (2.2%) CNS events. At 5 years of median follow-up, failure-free survival, overall survival, and CNS progression rates were 74%, 83%, and 2.3%, respectively. Treatment reduced the risk of progression compared with our previous trial, in which systemic CNS prophylaxis was given after 6 courses of biweekly R-CHOEP (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.31-0.77; P = .002) and overcame the adverse impact of an aaIPI score of 3 on survival. In addition, outcome of the patients with BCL2/MYC double-hit lymphomas was comparable to the patients without the rearrangements. The results are encouraging, with a low toxic death rate, low number of CNS events, and favorable survival rates. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01325194.},

Department of reproductive medicine of 38 hospitals in the Netherlands. Between January 2002 and February 2004, we prospectively included consecutive subfertile couples who had not been evaluated previously for subfertility. We estimated the contribution of the PCT result to the existing prediction model for spontaneous pregnancy by calculating the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of an abnormal PCT result. We constructed a second prediction model (PCT model) based on the reference model including the PCT. Primary endpoint in this study was ongoing pregnancy. We evaluated the performance of the PCT model in comparison with the reference model by calculating goodness of fit, discrimination, calibration, and the "net reclassification improvement". We included 3,021 couples of whom 537 (18%) had a spontaneous pregnancy and 55 (1.8%) a nonsuccessful pregnancy; 1,316 (44%) started treatment within 12 months, 824 (27%) neither started treatment nor became pregnant, and 289 (10%) became lost to follow-up within 12 months. The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62 to 0.94). The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.84) in case of no spermatozoa, 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57 to 1.2) in case of nonmotile spermatozoa, and 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.8) in case of motile, nonprogressive spermatozoa. Adding the PCT result to the reference model did not improve goodness of fit. Discrimination was equally poor for the PCT model and the reference model. The calibration plots of both models showed comparably good calibration. The net reclassification improvement of the predictions of the PCT model compared with the reference model was -1.1%. This study demonstrated that the PCT has prognostic value but does not add substantially to a prognostic model for spontaneous pregnancy.},

We analyzed the effect of sulforaphane on the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. Sulforaphane inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro with IC(50)s of around 10-15 μM and induced apoptosis. In pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse model, administration of sulforaphane showed remarkable inhibition of tumor growth without apparent toxicity noticed. We found that sulforaphane induced the degradation of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) client proteins and blocked the interaction of Hsp90 with its cochaperone p50(Cdc37) in pancreatic cancer cells. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with an isoleucine-specific labeling strategy, we overcame the protein size limit of conventional NMR and studied the interaction of sulforaphane with full-length Hsp90 dimer (170 kDa) in solution. NMR revealed multiple chemical shifts in sheet 2 and the adjacent loop in Hsp90 N-terminal domain after incubation of Hsp90 with sulforaphane. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry further mapped a short peptide in this region that was tagged with sulforaphane. These data suggest a new mechanism of sulforaphane that disrupts protein-protein interaction in Hsp90 complex for its chemopreventive activity.},

MECs were previously shown to be involved in the clearance of waste products from the CSF and in maintaining the optic nerve microenvironment. In addition, MECs are involved in immunological processes in the brain by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to various pathologically relevant stress conditions. In this study, we analysed the uptake of latex beads as well as bacteria by human MECs using flow cytometric analyses. We found that MECs are highly active phagocytes able of ingesting large amounts of latex beads, as well as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Phagocytic activity of MECs was sensitive to nocodazole and cytochalasin D treatment to a varying degree depending on particle composition. Interestingly, Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus are more readily taken up compared with Gram-negative Escherichia coli. In addition, pre-treatment of MECs with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) enhanced S. aureus uptake, whereas PMA but not LPS was effective in enhancing E. coli uptake. Thus, MECs are highly active facultative phagocytes likely important for the maintenance of CSF homeostasis and host defence in the central nervous system especially against Gram-positive bacteria.},

Furthermore, the uptake of apoptotic cells by MECs was immune suppressive via inhibiting the secretion of pro-inflammatory and chemoattractant cytokines and chemokines IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, MIF, and CXCL1, while increasing the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist by MECs.

Weight, age, and session effect (awake vs general anesthesia) were identified as relevant covariates on the clearance (CL) of NE. A 10% decrease in NE CL was observed after general anesthesia induction. This difference between sessions is better explained by the measured concentration of propofol, rather than the anticipated impact of cardiac output.

During session A, volunteers received midazolam 0.035 to 0.05 mg x kg(-1) IV for 1 minute followed by an infusion of 0.035 to 0.05 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 59 minutes. During session B, in addition to this midazolam infusion scheme, a target-controlled infusion of propofol (constant C(T): 0.6 or 1.0 microg x mL(-1)) was given from 15 minutes before the start until 6 hours after termination of the midazolam infusion. Arterial blood samples for propofol and midazolam concentration analysis were taken until 6 hours after termination of the midazolam infusion. Nonlinear mixed-effect models examining the influence of propofol and hemodynamic variables on midazolam pharmacokinetics were constructed using Akaike's information-theoretic criterion for model selection. In the presence of a mean blood propofol concentration of 1.2 microg x mL(-1), the plasma midazolam concentration was increased by 26.9% + or - 9.4% compared with midazolam given as a single drug. Propofol (C(blood): 1.2 microg x mL(-1)) reduced midazolam central volume of distribution from 5.37 to 2.98 L, elimination clearance from 0.39 to 0.31 L x min(-1), and rapid distribution clearance from 2.77 to 2.11 L x min(-1). Inclusion of heart rate further improved the pharmacokinetic model of midazolam. Propofol reduces the distribution and clearance of midazolam in a concentration-dependent manner.

Here we report the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina 450K array on whole blood samples of 68 Ghanaians. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were assessed for plasma renin concentration, aldosterone, and ARR using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and technical covariates. Additionally, we extracted methylation loci previously associated with hypertension, kidney function, or that were annotated to RAAS-related genes and associated these with renin and aldosterone concentration. We identified one DMP for renin, ten DMPs for aldosterone, and one DMP associated with ARR. Top DMPs were annotated to the PTPRN2, SKIL, and KCNT1 genes, which have been reported in relation to cardiometabolic risk factors, atherosclerosis, and sodium-potassium handling. Moreover, EWAS loci previously associated with hypertension, kidney function, or RAAS-related genes were also associated with renin, aldosterone, and ARR. In this first EWAS on RAAS hormones, we identified DMPs associated with renin, aldosterone, and ARR in a SSA population. These findings are a first step in understanding the role of DNA methylation in regulation of the RAAS in general and in a SSA population specifically. Replication and translational studies are needed to establish the role of these DMPs in the hypertension burden in SSA populations.},

  abstract = {DNA-methylation has been associated with plasma lipid concentration in populations of diverse ethnic backgrounds, but epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in West-Africans are lacking. The aim of this study was to identify DNA-methylation loci associated with plasma lipids in Ghanaians. We conducted an EWAS using Illumina 450k DNA-methylation array profiles of extracted DNA from 663 Ghanaian participants. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were examined for association with plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and technical covariates. Findings were replicated in independent cohorts of different ethnicities. We identified one significantly associated DMP with triglycerides (cg19693031 annotated to TXNIP, regression coefficient beta -0.26, false discovery rate adjusted p-value 0.001), which replicated in-silico in South African Batswana, African American, and European populations. From the top five DMPs with the lowest nominal p-values, two additional DMPs for triglycerides (CPT1A, ABCG1), two DMPs for LDL-cholesterol (EPSTI1, cg13781819), and one for TC (TXNIP) replicated. With the exception of EPSTI1, these loci are involved in lipid transport/metabolism or are known GWAS-associated loci. The top 5 DMPs per lipid trait explained 9.5% in the variance of TC, 8.3% in LDL-cholesterol, 6.1% in HDL-cholesterol, and 11.0% in triglycerides. The top DMPs identified in this study are in loci that play a role in lipid metabolism across populations, including West-Africans. Future studies including larger sample size, longitudinal study design and translational research is needed to increase our understanding on the epigenetic regulation of lipid metabolism among West-African populations.

Data analysis of 548 paediatric LQTS patients at 12 German tertiary care centres. Primary outcome was the occurrence of a major arrhythmic event (MAE) defined as sudden cardiac death (SCD), aborted cardiac arrest (ACA) and appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy before age 18 years. Patients (48.9% male) presented at a median age of 6.3 (interquartile range 0.5-11.7) years with incidental findings (26.5%), symptoms (31.3%), and for cascade screening (42.2%). Primary outcome was reached in 58 patients (10.6%): SCD in 7 (1.3%), ACA in 40 (7.3%), and appropriate ICD therapy in 11 (2.0%), with an overall event rate of 1.0 per 100 patient-years at risk. During follow-up (before 18 years of age), 92.1% of patients received cardiac medication. An ICD was implanted in 73 patients (13.3%) of whom 25 (34.2%) received appropriate therapy. In multivariate analysis, the likelihood of experiencing a MAE was greater in patients with LQT3 [hazard ratio (HR) 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-5.6, P = .03], syncope (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.7-5.5, P < .01), absence of cardiac medication (HR 9.5, 95% CI 5.3-17.3, P < .01), and QTc ≥500 ms (HR 2.9, 95% CI 1.4-6.3, P < .01). In subanalyses, a pathogenic variant in the KCNH2 pore region of LQT2 patients and younger age at symptom presentation were identified as risk factors. Paediatric LQTS patients are at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias at <18 years of age and require a meticulous personalized clinical approach.},

Computed tomography (CT) scan disclosed expansion and diffusely increased attenuation of the medial hallux sesamoid with focal cortical erosion and extraosseous extension of high attenuation content. The subsequent resection and pathology revealed intraosseous tophus deposition, which is particularly rare at this site and at this age. Imaging studies revealed some characteristic imaging features which can retrospectively be attributed to gouty tophus. When an expansile osteolytic lesion manifesting low signal intensity on T2-weighted image and internal calcifications on CT scan is encountered, the possibility of intraosseous tophus should be included in the list of differential diagnoses, even in a teenage patient without prior history of gout.},

The long and complex reconstruction process following such a procedure makes understanding the patient rehabilitation experience necessary in order to develop an effective educational strategy that addresses patient needs. This study investigated the defecation reconstruction experience of low rectal cancer patients after ASS. Researchers used a case study method and purposive sampling. Participants were followed for a period of 6 to 8 months and interviewed between 5 and 7 times. Eleven themes emerged from content analysis. Before temporary colostomy take-down: anal leakage and discomfort, dignity impairment, struggling to locate the contracting muscle, restoring anal strength. After colostomy take-down: loss of defecating control again and damage to peri-anal skin, perceived effects and insistence on persisting with training, faith in effectiveness, trying to comply, trying to restrict medication use, maintaining a hygienic self-image and dignity, promoting quality of life, and a chance to regain a normal life. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS: Participants described the rehabilitation exercise as beneficial to controlling the defecation and expressed their intent to continue such. Participant experiences can assist stoma nurses to provide better physical and psychological care to ASS patients.},

In two Nordic Lymphoma Group randomized trials, symptomatic or clearly progressing patients were treated first line with a rituximab-containing regimen without chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to assess long-term survival, risk of transformation, and need of new therapies. Data were collected at cross-sectional follow-up for 321 patients with indolent lymphoma (84% with follicular lymphomas [FL]) included in one of two Nordic Lymphoma Group trials (accrual 1998 to 1999 and 2002 to 2008). All patients received first-line therapy with one or two cycles of four weekly infusions of rituximab 375 mg/m At the end of follow-up, 73% of patients were alive, with a median follow-up after random assignment of 10.6 years. Among all, 36% (38% with FL) had never needed chemotherapy. For patients with FL who required new therapy within 24 months because of early disease progression, the 10-year survival rate was 59% versus 81% for those with longer remission. Interferon was not shown to improve long-term outcome. Transformation was diagnosed in 20% of all patients (2.4% per person-year) and in 18% with FL. An additional malignancy was found in 12%. Approximately one third of patients with symptomatic indolent lymphoma (30% with FL, 23% without FL) did not need new therapy in the long term after first-line rituximab without chemotherapy. In the entire cohort, 10-year survival was excellent with no major safety issues, which suggests that chemotherapy can be delayed safely in the majority of patients.},

Unique challenges faced by healthcare facilities in border regions render them particularly vulnerable during crises, emphasizing the need to promote resilience in these areas. The current study evaluated the state and needs of resilience in healthcare professionals in a representative European border region. All hospitals and emergency medical care services in the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands) were approached to participate via an online-survey. Behavioral data on psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), work-related stressors, individual resilience (Brief Resilience Scale, Resilience at Work scale), and organizational resilience (Benchmark Resilience Tool-short) were collected. 2233 participants initiated the survey with 500 responses included in the analysis. 46% of the participants indicated clinically significant psychological distress. Most challenging stressors were staff availability, available time, and workload. On average, individual resilience was in the normal range, yet 15.6% showed below average resilience. At the organizational level, healthcare institutions can particularly enhance resilience in the domains of Internal resources, Situation Awareness, and Unity of purpose. Compared to their neighbor countries, German healthcare professionals indicated higher levels of depressive symptoms, were more burdened by work-related stressors, and reported lower levels of organizational resilience. Findings highlight that healthcare institutions not only need to promote the resilience of the individual employee particularly in border regions, healthcare institutions, must also act to be better prepared for potential threats and crises while considering each country's unique needs.},

This broadening involves amide protons found in the non-specific lac-DNA structure to be interacting with the DNA phosphate backbone, and can be ascribed to DNA sliding of the protein along the DNA. This NMR exchange broadening has been used to estimate the 1D diffusion constant for sliding along non-specific DNA. The observed 1D diffusion constant of 4×10(-12) cm(2)/s is two orders of magnitude smaller than derived from previous kinetic experiments, but falls in the range of values determined more recently using single molecule methods. This strongly supports the notion that sliding could play at most a minor role in the association kinetics of binding of lac repressor to lac operator and that other processes such as hopping and intersegment transfer contribute to facilitate the DNA recognition process.},

However, a systematic and quantified examination of time and space experience in terms of a self-report scale is still missing which eventually could also be used for clinical differential diagnosis. Based on historical phenomenological literature and patients' subjective reports, we here introduce, in a first step, the Scale for Time and Space Experience of Anxiety (STEA) in a smaller sample of 19 subjects with anxiety disorders and, in a second step, validate its shorter clinical version (cSTEA) in a larger sample of 48 anxiety subjects. The main findings are (i) high convergent and divergent validity of STEA with both Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (r = 0.7325; p < 0.001) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (r = 0.7749; p < 0.0001), as well as with spontaneous mind wandering (MWS) (r = 0.7343; p < 0.001) and deliberate mind wandering (MWD) (r = 0.1152; p > 0.05), (ii) statistical feature selection shows 8 key items for future clinical usage (cSTEA) focusing on the experience of temporal and spatial constriction, (iii) the effects of time and space experience (i.e., for both STEA and cSTEA scores) on the level of anxiety (BAI) are mediated by the degree of spontaneous mind wandering (MWS), (iv) cSTEA allows for differentiating high levels of anxiety from the severity of comorbid depressive symptoms, and (v) significant reduction in the cSTEA scores after a therapeutic intervention (breathing therapy). Together, our study introduces a novel fully quantified and highly valid self-report instrument, the STEA, for measuring time-space experiences in anxiety. Further we develop a shorter clinical version (cSTEA) which allows assessing time space experience in a valid, quick, and simple way for diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and therapeutic monitoring of anxiety.},

With the introduction of digitization and whole-slide images of prostate biopsies, computer-aided grading becomes feasible. Computer-aided grading has the potential to improve histopathological grading and treatment selection for prostate cancer. Automated detection of GPs and determination of the grade groups (GG) using a convolutional neural network. In total, 96 prostate biopsies from 38 patients are annotated on pixel-level. Automated detection of GP 3 and GP ≥ 4 in digitized prostate biopsies is performed by re-training the Inception-v3 convolutional neural network (CNN). The outcome of the CNN is subsequently converted into probability maps of GP ≥ 3 and GP ≥ 4, and the GG of the whole biopsy is obtained according to these probability maps. Differentiation between non-atypical and malignant (GP ≥ 3) areas resulted in an accuracy of 92% with a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 93%, respectively. The differentiation between GP ≥ 4 and GP ≤ 3 was accurate for 90%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77 and 94%, respectively. Concordance of our automated GG determination method with a genitourinary pathologist was obtained in 65% (κ = 0.70), indicating substantial agreement. A CNN allows for accurate differentiation between non-atypical and malignant areas as defined by GPs, leading to a substantial agreement with the pathologist in defining the GG.},

To combine digital histopathology slides with clinical data to predict 1- and 5-yr recurrence-free survival of NMIBC patients using deep learning. Data of patients undergoing a transurethral resection of a bladder tumor between 2000 and 2018 at a Dutch academic medical center were selected. Corresponding histological slides were digitized. A three-step approach was used to predict 1- and 5-yr recurrence-free survival. First, a segmentation network was used to detect the urothelium on the digital histopathology slides. Second, a selection network was trained for the selection of patches associated with recurrence. Third, a classification network, combining the information of the selection network with clinical data, was trained to give the probability of 1- and 5-yr recurrence-free survival. The accuracy of the deep learning-based model was compared with a multivariable logistic regression model using clinical data only. In the 1- and 5-yr follow-up cohorts, 359 and 281 patients were included with recurrence rates of 27% and 63%, respectively. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the model combining digital histopathology slide data with clinical data were 0.62 and 0.76 for 1- and 5-yr recurrence predictions, respectively, which were higher than those of the model using digital histopathology slide data only (AUCs of 0.56 and 0.72, respectively) and the multivariable logistic regression (AUCs of 0.58 and 0.57, respectively). In our population, the deep learning-based model combining digital histopathology slides and clinical data enhances the prediction of recurrence (within 5 yr) compared with models using clinical data or image data only. By combining histopathology images and patient record data using deep learning, the prediction of recurrence in bladder cancer patients is enhanced.},

Moreover, it features auxiliary functions for (tomographic) alignment, image processing and simulation of imaging experiments. The capability of the toolbox is illustrated by an example of a catalytic nanoparticle, imaged in the deeply holographic regime at the `GINIX' instrument of the P10 beamline at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). Due to its modular design, the toolbox can be used for algorithmic development and benchmarking in a lean and flexible manner, or be interfaced and integrated in the reconstruction pipeline of other synchrotron or X-ray free-electron laser instruments for phase imaging based on propagation.},

  abstract = {Recently WAC was reported as a candidate gene for intellectual disability (ID) based on the identification of a de novo mutation in an individual with severe ID. WAC regulates transcription-coupled histone H2B ubiquitination and has previously been implicated in the 10p12p11 contiguous gene deletion syndrome. In this study, we report on 10 individuals with de novo WAC mutations which we identified through routine (diagnostic) exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of WAC in 2326 individuals with unexplained ID. All but one mutation was expected to lead to a loss-of-function of WAC. Clinical evaluation of all individuals revealed phenotypic overlap for mild ID, hypotonia, behavioral problems and distinctive facial dysmorphisms, including a square-shaped face, deep set eyes, long palpebral fissures, and a broad mouth and chin. These clinical features were also previously reported in individuals with 10p12p11 microdeletion syndrome. To investigate the role of WAC in ID, we studied the importance of the Drosophila WAC orthologue (CG8949) in habituation, a non-associative learning paradigm. Neuronal knockdown of Drosophila CG8949 resulted in impaired learning, suggesting that WAC is required in neurons for normal cognitive performance. In conclusion, we defined a clinically recognizable ID syndrome, caused by de novo loss-of-function mutations in WAC. Independent functional evidence in Drosophila further supported the role of WAC in ID. On the basis of our data WAC can be added to the list of ID genes with a role in transcription regulation through histone modification.},

We analyzed the long-term efficacy of our innovative multidisciplinary protocol to treat chronic refractory pain that aims to preserve kidney function by applying among other sequential nerve blocks. Patients were eligible if pain was present ≥3 months with a score of ≥50 on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100, was negatively affecting quality of life and if there had been insufficient response to previous therapies, including opioid treatment. Treatment options were, in order, analgesics, cyst aspiration and fenestration, nerve blocks and nephrectomy. A total of 101 patients were assessed in our clinic (mean age 50 ± 11 years, 65.3% females). Eight patients were treated with medication, 6 by cyst aspiration or fenestration, 63 by nerve blocks and 6 received surgery as the first treatment option. Overall, 76.9% experienced a positive effect on pain complaints shortly after treatment. The VAS score was reduced from 60/100 to 20/100 (P < 0.001) and patients decreased their number of nonopioid and opioid analgesics significantly (P < 0.001, P = 0.01, respectively). A substantial number of the patients (n = 51) needed additional treatment. At the end of follow-up in only 13 patients (12.9%) was surgical intervention necessary: 11 nephrectomies (of which 10 were in patients already on kidney function replacement treatment), 1 liver transplantation and 1 partial hepatectomy. After a median follow-up of 4.5 years (interquartile range 2.5-5.3), 69.0% of the patients still had fewer pain complaints. These data indicate that our multidisciplinary treatment protocol appears effective in reducing pain in the majority of patients with chronic refractory pain, while postponing or even avoiding in most patients surgical interventions such as nephrectomy in most patients.},

Methods A total of 29 cadaveric hearts were used. The left coronary artery and its branches were dissected. The hearts were then classified according to the number of branches. The LMT length was measured with a digital gauge, and the LAD-CX angle, LMTLAD angle and LMT-CX angle with a manual goniometer. Results The average value of the LMT length was 9.0 mm (6.0-13.5). In 20 (68.97%) samples, the LMT was divided into two terminal branches. There was no statistically significant difference (p=0.321) in LMT length between the hearts with a bifurcation and without it. The average value of the LAD-CX angle was 89.0⁰ (74.5-93.0), with a statistically significant difference (p=0.020) comparing to hearts with trifurcation. The mean value of the LMT-LAD angle was 30.83±9.23⁰ and it was significantly lower (p=0.006) in the group of hearts with bifurcation compared to the group with trifurcation of the main trunk. Conclusion The LMT length shows great variability and is not related to the LAD-CX, LMT-LAD or the LMT-CX angle.

New materials to be integrated with the Si platform must conform to stringent purity standards. Here, we investigate graphene layers grown on copper foils by chemical vapor deposition and transferred to silicon wafers by wet etching and electrochemical delamination methods with respect to residual submonolayer metallic contaminations. Regardless of the transfer method and associated cleaning scheme, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and total reflection X-ray fluorescence measurements indicate that the graphene sheets are contaminated with residual metals (copper, iron) with a concentration exceeding 10(13) atoms/cm(2). These metal impurities appear to be partially mobile upon thermal treatment, as shown by depth profiling and reduction of the minority charge carrier diffusion length in the silicon substrate. As residual metallic impurities can significantly alter electronic and electrochemical properties of graphene and can severely impede the process of integration with silicon microelectronics, these results reveal that further progress in synthesis, handling, and cleaning of graphene is required to advance electronic and optoelectronic applications.},

Adaptation of therapeutic goals can be challenging for medical staff, patients and relatives; however, descriptions of these transition trajectories are rare. The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize the consultation requests of the ICU to the PC consultation team as well as the patients by a description of trajectories and interventions. Retrospective analysis of all patients receiving intensive care at RWTH Aachen University Hospital in 2019 for whom a PC consultation was requested. The patient population transferred from the ICU to the PC ward was compared with the non-transferred population. In each case, the primary consultation was evaluated regarding the following factors: question, vigilance, length of time from consultation request to its performance, and primary focus of the question. The question focus was categorized into "symptom control", "counselling" and "transfer" (tick options). In addition, a free text field was available for further notes. Exploration of diagnoses was complemented by accessing the electronic health records. A total of 102 consultation requests from the ICU to the PC ward were evaluated. The morbidity of patients was high, and most patients had at least one of the following diagnoses: pulmonary (62%), cardiovascular (61%), and/or neurological disease (55%). Of the patients 32 (31%) were transferred to the PC ward, among whom weakness (94%), fatigue (77%), anxiety (55%), pain (53%), and dyspnea (48%) were the most frequently noted symptoms. Of the transferred patients 5 (16%) could be discharged to home, nursing home, hospice or other. In total, 35 (34%) of all patients who were seen by palliative care specialists on ICUs in 2019 could be discharged alive. The most frequent reasons for nonadmission were lack of capacity of the PC ward (33%), dying while being on the waiting list (20%), and refusal by the patient (20%). Of the patients, 7 (26%) died within 48 h after they had been transferred to the PC ward. Performed consultation services "symptom control" (χ The need for palliative care support in the ICUs exceeded the admission capacity of the PC ward.

In a phase 3 study, we compared 2 induction regimens in newly diagnosed patients age 18 to 65 years with AML: idarubicine-cytarabine (cycle 1) and daunorubicin and intermediate-dose cytarabine (cycle 2) without or with lenalidomide (15 mg orally on days 1-21). One final consolidation cycle of chemotherapy or autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) or allogeneic SCT (allo-SCT) was provided according to a prognostic risk and minimal residual disease (MRD)-adapted approach. Event-free survival (EFS; primary end point) and other clinical end points were assessed. A second random assignment in patients in complete response or in complete response with incomplete hematologic recovery after cycle 3 or auto-SCT involved 6 cycles of maintenance with lenalidomide (10 mg on days 1-21) or observation. In all, 392 patients were randomly assigned to the control group, and 388 patients were randomly assigned to lenalidomide induction. At a median follow-up of 41 months, the study revealed no differences in outcome between the treatments (EFS, 44% ± 2% standard error and overall survival, 54% ± 2% at 4 years for both arms) although in an exploratory post hoc analysis, a lenalidomide benefit was suggested in SRSF2-mutant AML. In relation to the previous Dutch-Belgian Hemato-Oncology Cooperative Group and Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (HOVON-SAKK) studies that used a similar 3-cycle regimen but did not pursue an MRD-guided approach, these survival estimates compare markedly more favorably. MRD status after cycle 2 lost prognostic value in intermediate-risk AML in the risk-adjusted treatment context. Maintenance with lenalidomide showed no apparent effect on relapse probability in 88 patients randomly assigned for this part of the study.},

How chemotherapy-induced cell death leads to efficient antigen presentation to T cells, however, remains a conundrum. We found that intratumoral CD11c(+)CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi) cells, which displayed some characteristics of inflammatory dendritic cells and included granulomonocytic precursors, were crucial for anthracycline-induced anticancer immune responses. ATP released by dying cancer cells recruited myeloid cells into tumors and stimulated the local differentiation of CD11c(+)CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi) cells. Such cells efficiently engulfed tumor antigens in situ and presented them to T lymphocytes, thus vaccinating mice, upon adoptive transfer, against a challenge with cancer cells. Manipulations preventing tumor infiltration by CD11c(+)CD11b(+)Ly6C(hi) cells, such as the local overexpression of ectonucleotidases, the blockade of purinergic receptors, or the neutralization of CD11b, abolished the immune system-dependent antitumor activity of anthracyclines. Our results identify a subset of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes as therapy-relevant antigen-presenting cells.},

A significantly higher prevalence of PMCV infection was observed in immature compared to mature individuals. The prevalence of both SAV and PMCV infections was higher in fish determined by fatty acid profiling to be 'recent' as opposed to 'early' escapees that had been in the wild for a longer period of time. This is the first study to establish a time-series of viral infection status of escapees entering a river with a native salmon population.

Several explorative studies have applied linear dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and classical Multi-Dimensional Scaling (cMDS) to gain insight into the spatial organization of these expression patterns. In this paper, we describe a non-linear embedding technique called Barnes-Hut Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH-SNE) that emphasizes the local similarity structure of high-dimensional data points. By applying BH-SNE to the gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlases, we demonstrate the consistency of the 2D, non-linear embedding of the sagittal and coronal mouse brain atlases, and across 6 human brains. In addition, we quantitatively show that BH-SNE maps are superior in their separation of neuroanatomical regions in comparison to PCA and cMDS. Finally, we assess the effect of higher-order principal components on the global structure of the BH-SNE similarity maps. Based on our observations, we conclude that BH-SNE maps with or without prior dimensionality reduction (based on PCA) provide comprehensive and intuitive insights in both the local and global spatial transcriptome structure of the human and mouse Allen Brain Atlases.},

Although the reasons may be many, the lack of a simplified algorithm for the assessment of DD specific to the perioperative arena, the implications of this diagnosis on clinical care, and the absence of therapeutic options are some of the commonly cited reasons. In this article, the authors address these possible reasons for the lack of routine application of Doppler indices to assess perioperative DD. The authors have chosen to highlight some of the most common conceptual questions, which often have been raised by anesthesiologists, and attempted to suggest answers. Drawing from their experience and data, the authors propose a simplified algorithm for the application of Doppler to assess and diagnose DD with an individualized and a mechanistic approach. The proposed algorithm is from within the premise of the published guidelines and attempts to simplify the perioperative approach. The authors hope this approach will be simple enough for routine application to affect therapy and a tangible change in outcome. The authors suggest that knowledge of left atrial size is valuable as a marker for persistently increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and its possible role in risk stratification.},

Whereas it implies chronicity, it lacks specificity in discriminating normal from a significantly remodeled MV apparatus. Regional aspects of MV remodeling have shown superior value over global remodeling in predicting recurrence after MV repair for IMR. Quite possibly, presence of specific regional changes in MV geometry that are unique to chronic IMR patients could also be used to diagnose the presence and track progression of remodeling. Knowledge of these changes in MV apparatus in patients with IMR can possibly be used to identify patients for surgical intervention before irreversible remodeling occurs. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiographic data were collected from patients who underwent MV surgery for IMR (IMR group, n = 66), and from patients with normal valvular and biventricular function (control group, n = 10). The acquired data of the MV were geometrically analyzed to make regional comparisons between the IMR and the control group to identify measurements that reliably differentiate normal from remodeled MVs. Lengthening of the middle potion of the anterior annulus (A2 regional perimeter: 11.149 mm versus 9.798 mm, p = 0.0041), larger nonplanarity angle (147.985 versus 140.720 degrees, p = 0.0459), and increased tenting angle of the posteromedial scallop of the posterior leaflet (P3 tenting angle: 44.354 versus 40.461 degrees, p = 0.0435) were sufficient in differentiating between IMR and the control group.

  abstract = {To assess the diagnostic yield of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in patients with symptoms and signs related to the trigeminal nerve. Medical records and MR imaging studies in 112 consecutive patients referred for MR imaging over 5 years were evaluated. MR images were independently reviewed by two neuroradiologists unaware of the clinical findings. Signs and symptoms at presentation were associated with either a positive or negative MR imaging outcome. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical variables related to imaging results. Sixty-eight (61%) patients had positive MR imaging findings related to symptoms and signs. Trigeminal neuralgia was correlated with a negative MR imaging outcome (P < .001). Numbness (P < .01), impaired sensation (P < .001), other neurologic symptoms and signs (P < .01), progression of symptoms and signs (P < .001), and duration of symptoms of less than 1 year (P < .001) corresponded to a positive MR imaging outcome. Two regression models, each with three clinical parameters (progression, duration < 1 year, and trigeminal neuralgia or impaired sensation), had comparable accuracy for prediction of the MR imaging outcome. Clinical findings can be used to identify groups in which a high or a low yield of MR imaging is correlated with symptoms and signs related to the trigeminal nerve.},

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records, imaging and histological specimens of 10 patients with 11 primary tumours of the trigeminal nerve. We assessed whether tumour site, size, morphology or signal characteristics were related to symptoms and signs or histological findings. Histological proof was available for 8 of 11 tumours: six schwannomas and two plexiform neurofibromas. The other three tumours were thought to be schwannomas, because they were present in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 and followed the course of the trigeminal nerve. Uncommon MRI appearances were observed in three schwannomas and included a large intratumoral haemorrhage, a mainly low-signal appearance on T2-weighted images and a rim-enhancing, multicystic appearance. Only four of nine schwannomas caused trigeminal nerve symptoms, including two with large cystic components, one haemorrhagic and one solid tumor. Of the five schwannomas which did not cause any trigeminal nerve symptoms, two were large. Only one of the plexiform neurofibromas caused trigeminal nerve symptoms. Additional neurological symptoms and signs, not related to the trigeminal nerve, could be attributed to the location of the tumour in three patients.},

  abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor, associated with hypercoagulability and thrombosis. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields), a non-invasive therapy that uses low-intensity, alternating electric fields to disrupt cancer cell division, prolongs survival when used concomitantly with radiochemotherapy. TTFields-treated patients often exhibit distinct recurrence patterns, suggesting a local interaction between TTFields and tumor-associated coagulation, underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study examined coagulation profiles in TTFields-treated patients' blood, tumor cells, and plasma-derived extracellular vesicles using molecular, hemostaseologic, and phenotypic analyses. Our findings revealed that short-term TTFields exposure significantly prolongs blood coagulation in GBM patients and healthy donors by altering tissue factor (TF) expression and disrupting the extrinsic coagulation pathway. TTFields reduced clot rigidity by decreasing Factor II/FXIII activity and platelet count, without impairing fibrinogen function. Patient-derived GBM cells exposed to TTFields exhibited increased TF abundance. RNA-based microarray analysis of GBM cells confirmed coagulation-related changes, including upregulation of platelet adhesion marker ITGA2, and downregulation of THBS1, a regulator of clotting, platelet aggregation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and tumor invasiveness. Additionally, TXNIP, a coagulation-modulating gene, was downregulated after TTFields exposure, indicating a link to immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment. In an allogeneic co-culture model of patient-derived GBM cells and peripheral blood, TTFields modulated coagulation and immune responses, likely by rebalancing pro- and anticoagulant factors in the tumor microenvironment, reducing the prothrombotic state, and altering inflammatory pathways. These findings provide insights into how TTFields influence coagulation and, eventually, immune regulation, offering strategies to optimize clinical decision-making and mitigating thromboembolic complications in GBM patients.},

We have observed such an intermolecular complex between a plasmid carrying the d(C)18 d(G)18 insert and the d(AG)5 oligonucleotide without bivalent cations in 200 mM of Na+ at pH4.0. Bivalent cations additionally stabilize the complex. We propose the structures for nearly isomorphous base-triads TA*A, CG*G and CG*A+. To identify the H-DNA-like structure, which includes the triplex between d(C)n d(G)n duplex and the AG-strand, we have cloned in a superhelical plasmid the insert: G10TTAA(AG)5. The data on photofootprinting and chemical modification with diethyl pyrocarbonate, potassium permanganate and dimethyl sulfate demonstrate that the H-like structure with triplex carrying CG*G and CG*A+ base triads is actually formed under acid conditions. In the course of this study we have come across unexpected results on probing of Py-Pu-Pu triplexes by dimethyl sulfate (DMS): the protection effect is observed not only for guanines entering the duplex but also for guanines in the third strand lying in the major groove. We have demonstrated this effect not only for the case the novel protonated Py-Pu-Pu triplex but also for the traditional non-protonated Py-Pu-Pu intramolecular triplex (H*-DNA) formed by the d(C)37 d(G)37 insert in supercoiled plasmid in the presence of Mg2+ ions.},

  abstract = {High levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are present in the gut mucosa of patients suffering form various diseases, most notably inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Since the inflammatory milieu can cause important alterations in epithelial cell function, we examined the cytokine effects on the expression of the enterocyte differentiation marker, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), a protein that detoxifies bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and limits fat absorption. Sodium butyrate (NaBu), a short-chain fatty acid and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was used to induce IAP expression in HT-29 cells and the cells were also treated +/- the cytokines. Northern blots confirmed IAP induction by NaBu, however, pretreatment (6 h) with either cytokine showed a dose-dependent inhibition of IAP expression. IAP Western analyses and alkaline phosphatase enzyme assays corroborated the Northern data and confirmed that the cytokines inhibit IAP induction. Transient transfections with a reporter plasmid carrying the human IAP promoter showed significant inhibition of NaBu-induced IAP gene activation by the cytokines (100 and 60% inhibition with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, respectively). Western analyses showed that NaBu induced H4 and H3 histone acetylation, and pretreatment with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha did not change this global acetylation pattern. In contrast, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that local histone acetylation of the IAP promoter region was specifically inhibited by either cytokine. We conclude that IL-1beta and TNF-alpha inhibit NaBu-induced IAP gene expression, likely by blocking the histone acetylation within its promoter. Cytokine-mediated IAP gene silencing may have important implications for gut epithelial function in the setting of intestinal inflammatory conditions.},

The evaluation was conducted on a tool developed in-house with different visualization approaches to the AI-generated Gleason grade and the corresponding XAI explanations on top of the original slide. The study was a heuristic evaluation of five XAI methods. The participants were 15 pathologists from the University Hospital of Augsburg with a wide range of experience in Gleason grading and AI. The evaluation consisted of a user information form, short questionnaires on each XAI method, a ranking of the methods, and a general questionnaire to evaluate the performance and usefulness of the AI. There were significant differences between the ratings of the methods, with Grad-CAM++ performing best. Both AI decision support and XAI explanations were seen as helpful by the majority of participants. In conclusion, our pilot study suggests that the evaluated XAI methods can indeed improve the usefulness and acceptance of AI. The results obtained are a good indicator, but further studies involving larger sample sizes are warranted to draw more definitive conclusions.},

Reduced pulsatile flow may induce mucosal hypoxia, upregulating factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and triggering neo-angiogenesis, leading to the development of gastrointestinal angiodysplasias (GIADs), a common cause of GIB. Digoxin inhibits HIF-1α and may prevent GIAD development, although its impact on the incidence of GIB remains uncertain. This meta-analysis (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024626222) evaluated the association between digoxin use and GIB occurrence (primary outcome) in patients with CF-LVADs. Research articles including adults with CF-LVADs, comparing digoxin users versus nonusers were included. Overall, four studies were included (n = 14,917; age 55 ± 13 years, 21% female) with 2,742 patients in the digoxin group and 12,175 in the no-digoxin group. Continuous-flow left ventricular assist device was axial (HeartMate II) in 78% of cases and centrifugal (HeartMate 3/HeartWare) in 22%. Digoxin use was associated with a nonsignificant lower risk of GIB (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-1.01). However, regarding GIAD-related GIB, digoxin was associated with a significantly lower risk (HR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.13-0.82). Among 14,917 patients with CF-LVADs, digoxin use was associated with a trend toward a lower risk of GIB and a lower risk of GIAD-related GIB.},

Patients with B-cell lymphoma treated with CD19 CAR T cells exhibited profound intestinal dysbiosis, exacerbated after CAR T-cell infusion. This dysbiosis was characterized by low bacterial richness, low soluble MAdCAM-1, and loss of Akkermansia species, associated with resistance to therapy. Mechanistically, oral Akkermansia massiliensis supplementation increased CAR T-cell infiltration into the bone marrow, inverted the CD4/CD8 CAR T-cell ratio, favored Tc1 CD8+ T-cell polarization, and promoted the release of tryptophan-derived indole metabolites, leading to better tumor control. The clinical benefit of Akkermansia spp. supplementation was abolished when CAR T cells were genetically deficient in the indole receptor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR-agonistic indoles alone failed to replicate the bacterium's anticancer effects. These findings suggest that Akkermansia supplementation could improve CAR T-cell potency in patients with intestinal Akkermansia deficiency. B-cell lymphoma patients treated with CAR T cells harbor major gut microbiota perturbations and related metabolism that restrain CAR T-cell therapy. Reprogramming the gut microbiota ecosystem by oral A. massiliensis supplementation induces CAR T-cell niching and Tc1 differentiation in the bone marrow, promoting tumor control in an AhR-dependent manner.},

For a long time, surface-exposed CRT was believed to participate in phagocytosis, mostly as a (co)receptor for specific opsonins. Recently, this view has been challenged by the observations that, similar to PS, CRT acts as a facultative recognition ligand on apoptotic cells, and that cytotoxic agents such as anthracyclines induce the exposure of CRT on the surface of dying tumor cells, thereby generating an engulfment signal that stimulates the uptake of apoptotic corpses and the presentation of the corresponding antigens by dendritic cells.

This failure to induce immunogenic cell death can be attributed to CDDP's incapacity to elicit the translocation of calreticulin (CRT) from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell surface. Here, we show that, in contrast to OXP, CDDP is unable to activate the protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK)-dependent phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). Accordingly, CDDP also failed to stimulate the formation of stress granules and macroautophagy, two processes that only occur after eIF2α phosphorylation. Using a screening method that monitors the voyage of CRT from the ER lumen to the cell surface, we identified thapsigargin (THAPS), an inhibitor of the sarco/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase as a molecule that on its own does not stimulate CRT exposure, yet endows CDDP with the capacity to do so. The combination of ER stress inducers (such as THAPS or tunicamycin) and CDDP effectively induced the translocation of CRT to the plasma membrane, as well as immunogenic cell death, although ER stress or CDDP alone was insufficient to induce CRT exposure and immunogenic cell death. Altogether, our results underscore the contribution of the ER stress response to the immunogenicity of cell death.},

One of the hallmarks of ICD dwells in the active release of ATP by cells committed to undergo, but not yet having succumbed to, apoptosis. We observed that the knockdown of essential autophagy-related genes (ATG3, ATG5, ATG7 and BECN1) abolishes the pre-apoptotic secretion of ATP by several human and murine cancer cell lines undergoing ICD. Accordingly, autophagy-competent, but not autophagy-deficient, tumor cells treated with ICD inducers in vitro could induce a tumor-specific immune response in vivo. Cancer cell lines stably depleted of ATG5 or ATG7 normally generate tumors in vivo, and such autophagy-deficient neoplasms, upon systemic treatment with ICD inducers, exhibit the same levels of apoptosis (as monitored by nuclear shrinkage and caspase-3 activation) and necrosis (as determined by following the kinetics of HMGB1 release) as their autophagy-proficient counterparts. However, autophagy-incompetent cancers fail to release ATP, to recruit immune effectors into the tumor bed and to respond to chemotherapy in conditions in which autophagy-competent tumors do so. The intratumoral administration of ecto-ATPase inhibitors increases extracellular ATP concentrations, re-establishes the therapy-induced recruitment of dendritic cells and T cells into the tumor bed, and restores the chemotherapeutic response of autophagy-deficient cancers. Altogether, these results suggest that autophagy-incompetent tumor cells escape from chemotherapy-induced (and perhaps natural?) immunosurveillance because they are unable to release ATP.},

Recent results indicate that the release of HMGB1 is one of the key features for cell death to be perceived as immunogenic, i.e., to be capable of triggering a cognate immune response in vivo. Thus, only anticancer agents that-among other features-allow for the release of HMGB1 as they induce cell death are expected to stimulate anticancer immune responses. To investigate the immunogenic potential of conventional anticancer agents and novel cell death inducers on a high-throughput scale, we engineered human osteosarcoma U2OS cells to express HMGB1 fused at the N-terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Coupled to fluorescence microscopy workstations for automated image acquisition and analysis, this HMGB1-GFP-based biosensor is amenable for the identification of potential inducers of immunogenic cell death among large chemical libraries.},

Recently, 3D printing (i.e. rapid prototyping) derived from 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has become possible. Due to the multiple steps involved and the specific equipment required for each step, it might be difficult to start implementing echocardiography-derived 3D printing in a clinical setting. In this review, we provide an overview of this process, including its logistics and organization of tools and materials, 3D TEE image acquisition strategies, data export, format conversion, segmentation, and printing. Generation of patient-specific models of cardiac anatomy from echocardiographic data is a feasible, practical application of 3D printing technology.},

Exploratory study. Tertiary-care university hospital. Percutaneous MitraClip procedure patient. Three-dimensional R-wave gated, full-volume transesophageal echocardiography images were obtained after deployment of the MitraClip device. A high-quality diastolic frame of the mitral valve was segmented using Mimics Innovation Suite and merged with a flange. The data were exported as a stereolithography (.stl) file, and a rigid 3-dimensional model was printed using a MakerBot Replicator 2 printer. A flexible silicone cast then was created and deployed in the pulse-duplicator chamber filled with a blood-mimicking fluid. The authors were able to obtain continuous-wave Doppler tracings of the valve inflow with a transesophageal echocardiography transducer. They also were able to generate diastolic ventricular and atrial pressure tracings. Pressure half-time and mitral valve area were computed from these measurements. This pulse duplicator shows promising applications in hemodynamic testing of patient-specific anatomy. Future modifications to the system may allow for visualization and data collection of gradients across the aortic valve.},

Twenty-two staff anesthesiologists performed a spinal and epidural on the 3D printed simulator and a commercially available Simulab phantom. Participants evaluated the tactile and ultrasound imaging fidelity of both phantoms via Likert-scale questionnaire. The 3D printed neuraxial phantom cost $13 to print and required 25 hours of non-supervised printing and 2 hours of assembly time. The 3D printed phantom was found to be less realistic to surface palpation than the Simulab phantom due to fragility of the silicone but had significantly better fidelity for loss of resistance, dural puncture and ultrasound imaging than the Simulab phantom. Low-cost neuraxial phantoms with fidelity comparable to commercial models can be produced using CT data and low-cost infrastructure consisting of FLOS software and desktop 3D printers.},

It was demonstrated that playing a video game leads to striatal dopamine release. It is unclear, however, which aspects of the game cause this reward system activation and if violent content contributes to it. We combined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with individual affect measures to address the neuronal correlates of violence in a video game. Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during fMRI measurement. We defined success as eliminating opponents, and failure as being eliminated themselves. Affect was measured directly before and after game play using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Failure and success events evoked increased activity in visual cortex but only failure decreased activity in orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus. A negative correlation between negative affect and responses to failure was evident in the right temporal pole (rTP). The deactivation of the caudate nucleus during failure is in accordance with its role in reward-prediction error: it occurred whenever subject missed an expected reward (being eliminated rather than eliminating the opponent). We found no indication that violence events were directly rewarding for the players. We addressed subjective evaluations of affect change due to gameplay to study the reward system. Subjects reporting greater negative affect after playing the game had less rTP activity associated with failure. The rTP may therefore be involved in evaluating the failure events in a social context, to regulate the players' mood.},

Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two independent coders performed the time-based analysis of the audio-visual game content. Boredom was operationalized as interaction of prolonged absence of goal-directed behavior with lowered affect in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). A decrease of positive affect (PA) correlated with response amplitudes in bilateral insular clusters extending into the amygdala to prolonged inactive phases in a game play and an increase in negative affect (NA) was associated with higher responses in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Precuneus and hippocampus responses were negatively correlated with changes in NA. We describe for the first time neural contributions to boredom, using a video game as complex virtual environment. Further our study confirmed that PA and NA are separable constructs, reflected by distinct neural patterns. PA may be associated with afferent limbic activity whereas NA with affective control.},

Test-retest reliability, presence of floor/ceiling effects, responsiveness to change, known-group validity, and concurrent validity were assessed for each score. A total of 901 patients had at least one valid PPIUS assessment after baseline. TUFS demonstrated good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.8), discriminated between groups defined based on International Prostate Symptom Score storage score severity (known-groups validity), had high concurrent validity, and had high responsiveness to change (Guyatt's responsiveness statistic 0.88), with an absence of floor or ceiling effects. The psychometric properties of other PPIUS-derived scores were not as consistently robust and showed either low-to-moderate responsiveness, presence of a floor or ceiling effect, or low-to-moderate test-retest reliability. This study shows that the PPIUS is reliable and valid in patients with LUTS associated with BPH. TUFS provided the best combination of psychometric properties of the six scores derived from the PPIUS and appeared to be an appropriate measure of urgency and frequency.},

Thirteen aortic segments were dilated and the luminal surfaces perfused. These perfusates were investigated for their vasomotor action per se and analyzed for their concentrations of potassium and endothelin-like immunoreactivity (ET-LI). The perfusates from angioplasty segments caused a contraction of 2.4 +/- 0.8 mN, while the perfusates from control segments only resulted in a contraction of 0.4 +/- 0.2 mN, (P = 0.004). There was no difference in the concentrations of potassium or ET-LI in the perfusates. Thirty aortic segments were used to measure the concentration of ET-LI in extractions of untreated, control, and angioplasty specimens. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the angioplasty segments to be denuded of their endothelium. In conclusion, perfusates from rabbit aortic segments treated by angioplasty in vitro have a strong vasoconstricting effect, for which neither endothelin nor potassium seems to be responsible.},

However, the quality of task completion, that is the final image quality, was subjectively evaluated in these studies. Ideally, the endpoint metric should be an objective comparison of the trainee-acquired image with a reference ideal image. Therefore, we developed a simulator-based methodology of preclinical verification of proficiency (VOP) in trainees by tracking objective evaluation of the final acquired images. We utilized geometric data from the simulator probes to compare image acquisition of anesthesia residents who participated in our structured longitudinal simulator-based TEE educational program vs ideal image planes determined from a panel of experts. Thirty-three participants completed the study (15 experts, 7 postgraduate year (PGY)-1 and 11 PGY-4). The results of our study demonstrated a significant difference in image capture success rates between learners and experts (χ2 = 14.716, df = 2, P < 0.001) with the difference between learners (PGY-1 and PGY-4) not being statistically significant (χ2 = 0, df = 1, P = 1.000). Therefore, our results suggest that novices (i.e. PGY-1 residents) are capable of attaining a level of proficiency comparable to those with modest training (i.e. PGY-4 residents) after completion of a simulation-based training curriculum. However, professionals with years of clinical training (i.e. attending physicians) exhibit a superior mastery of such skills. It is hence feasible to develop a simulator-based VOP program in performance of TEE for junior anesthesia residents.},

They are characterized by high rates of relapse and chronicity, often resulting in substantial impairment across the lifespan. Genetic factors play an important role in the vulnerability toward anxiety disorders. However, genetic contribution to anxiety in youth is not well understood and can change across developmental stages. Large-scale genetic studies of youth are needed with detailed assessments of symptoms of anxiety disorders and their major comorbidities to inform early intervention or preventative strategies and suggest novel targets for therapeutics and personalization of care. The Genetic Architecture of Youth Anxiety (GAYA) study is a Pan-Canadian effort of clinical and genetic experts with specific recruitment sites in Calgary, Halifax, Hamilton, Toronto, and Vancouver. Youth aged 10-19 (n = 13,000) will be recruited from both clinical and community settings and will provide saliva samples, complete online questionnaires on demographics, symptoms of mental health concerns, and behavioural inhibition, and complete neurocognitive tasks. A subset of youth will be offered access to a self-managed Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy resource. Analyses will focus on the identification of novel genetic risk loci for anxiety disorders in youth and assess how much of the genetic risk for anxiety disorders is unique or shared across the life span. Results will substantially inform early intervention or preventative strategies and suggest novel targets for therapeutics and personalization of care. Given that the GAYA study will be the biggest genomic study of anxiety disorders in youth in Canada, this project will further foster collaborations nationally and across the world.},

  abstract = {Multivariate techniques better fit the anatomy of complex neuropsychiatric disorders which are characterized not by alterations in a single region, but rather by variations across distributed brain networks. Here, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns of covariance across brain regions and relate them to clinical and demographic variables in a large generalizable dataset of individuals with bipolar disorders and controls. We then compared performance of PCA and clustering on identical sample to identify which methodology was better in capturing links between brain and clinical measures. Using data from the ENIGMA-BD working group, we investigated T1-weighted structural MRI data from 2436 participants with BD and healthy controls, and applied PCA to cortical thickness and surface area measures. We then studied the association of principal components with clinical and demographic variables using mixed regression models. We compared the PCA model with our prior clustering analyses of the same data and also tested it in a replication sample of 327 participants with BD or schizophrenia and healthy controls. The first principal component, which indexed a greater cortical thickness across all 68 cortical regions, was negatively associated with BD, BMI, antipsychotic medications, and age and was positively associated with Li treatment. PCA demonstrated superior goodness of fit to clustering when predicting diagnosis and BMI. Moreover, applying the PCA model to the replication sample yielded significant differences in cortical thickness between healthy controls and individuals with BD or schizophrenia. Cortical thickness in the same widespread regional network as determined by PCA was negatively associated with different clinical and demographic variables, including diagnosis, age, BMI, and treatment with antipsychotic medications or lithium. PCA outperformed clustering and provided an easy-to-use and interpret method to study multivariate associations between brain structure and system-level variables. PRACTITIONER POINTS: In this study of 2770 Individuals, we confirmed that cortical thickness in widespread regional networks as determined by principal component analysis (PCA) was negatively associated with relevant clinical and demographic variables, including diagnosis, age, BMI, and treatment with antipsychotic medications or lithium. Significant associations of many different system-level variables with the same brain network suggest a lack of one-to-one mapping of individual clinical and demographic factors to specific patterns of brain changes. PCA outperformed clustering analysis in the same data set when predicting group or BMI, providing a superior method for studying multivariate associations between brain structure and system-level variables.},

  abstract = {The exact onset of brain injury in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. Our aim was, therefore, to assess the association between prenatal Doppler flow patterns, postnatal cerebral oxygenation and short-term neurological outcome. Prenatally, we measured pulsatility indices of the middle cerebral (MCA-PI) and umbilical artery (UA-PI) and calculated cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). After birth, cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) were assessed during the first 3 days after birth, and during and for 24 hours after every surgical procedure within the first 3 months after birth. Neurological outcome was determined preoperatively and at 3 months of age by assessing general movements and calculating the Motor Optimality Score (MOS). Thirty-six infants were included. MOS at 3 months was associated with MCA-PI (rho 0.41, P = 0.04), UA-PI (rho -0.39, P = 0.047, and CPR (rho 0.50, P = 0.01). Infants with abnormal MOS had lower MCA-PI (P = 0.02) and CPR (P = 0.01) and higher UA-PI at the last measurement (P = 0.03) before birth. In infants with abnormal MOS, rcSO2 tended to be lower during the first 3 days after birth, and FTOE was significantly higher on the second day after birth (P = 0.04). Intraoperative and postoperative rcSO2 and FTOE were not associated with short-term neurological outcome. In infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD, the prenatal period may play an important role in developmental outcome. Additional research is needed to clarify the relationship between preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative cerebral oxygenation and developmental outcome in infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD.},

  abstract = {The use of collaborative health research approaches, such as integrated knowledge translation (IKT), was challenged during the COVID-19 pandemic due to physical distancing measures and transition to virtual platforms. As IKT trainees (i.e. graduate students, postdoctoral scholars) within the Integrated Knowledge Translation Research Network (IKTRN), we experienced several changes and adaptations to our daily routine, work and research environments due to the rapid transition to virtual platforms. While there was an increased capacity to communicate at local, national and international levels, gaps in equitable access to training and partnership opportunities at universities and organizations have emerged. This essay explores the experiences and reflections of 16 IKTRN trainees during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic at the micro (individual), meso (organizational) and macro (system) levels. The micro level, or individual experiences, focuses on topics of self-care (taking care of oneself for physical and mental well-being), maintaining research activities and productivity, and leisure (social engagement and taking time for oneself), while conducting IKT research during the pandemic. At the meso level, the role of programmes and organizations explores whether and how institutions were able to adapt and continue research and/or partnerships during the pandemic. At the macro level, we discuss implications for policies to support IKT trainees and research, during and beyond emergency situations. Themes were identified that intersected across all levels, which included (i) equitable access to training and partnerships; (ii) capacity for reflexivity; (iii) embracing changing opportunities; and (iv) strengthening collaborative relationships. These intersecting themes represent ways of encouraging sustainable and equitable improvements towards establishing and maintaining collaborative health research approaches. This essay is a summary of our collective experiences and aims to provide suggestions on how organizations and universities can support future trainees conducting collaborative research. Thus, we hope to inform more equitable and sustainable collaborative health research approaches and training in the post-pandemic era.},

Several epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have found DNA methylation loci associated with T2D in European populations. However, data from African populations are lacking. We undertook the first EWAS for T2D among sub-Saharan Africans, aiming at identifying ubiquitous and novel DNA methylation loci associated with T2D. The Illumina 450k DNA-methylation array was used on whole blood samples of 713 Ghanaian participants (256 with T2D, 457 controls) from the cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for T2D and HbA1c were identified through linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, estimated cell counts, hybridization batch, array position and body mass index (BMI). We also did a candidate analysis of previously reported EWAS loci for T2D in non-African populations, identified through a systematic literature search. Four DMPs [cg19693031 (TXNIP), cg04816311 (C7orf50), cg00574958 (CPT1A), cg07988171 (TPM4)] were associated with T2D after correction for inflation by possible systematic biases. The most strongly associated DMP-cg19693031, TXNIP (P = 2.6E-19) -showed hypomethylation in T2D cases compared with controls. Two out of the four DMPs [cg19693031 (TXNIP), cg04816311 (C7orf50)] remained associated with T2D after adjustment for BMI, and one locus [cg07988171 (TPM4)] that has not been reported previously. In this first EWAS for T2D in sub-Saharan Africans, we have identified four DMPs at epigenome-wide level, one of which is novel. These findings provide insight into the epigenetic loci that underlie the burden of T2D in sub-Saharan Africans.},

The liquid formulations used in these e-cigarettes contain nicotine in high concentrations; ingestion of these liquids can be fatal. A 42-year-old male was admitted to the Intensive Care ward due to cardiac arrest. The patient had ingested highly concentrated liquid nicotine, originating from a vial with liquid for e-cigarettes. When the ambulance personnel found the patient he did not have a pulse; following CPR and administration of adrenaline his pulse returned. Upon admission, the plasma nicotine level was high at 3.0 mg/l (reference values for a smoker are 0.01-0.05 mg/l) and the patient's neurological function was poor. The patient was treated symptomatically, but eventually died of a postanoxic encephalopathy. Nicotine e-liquids are highly concentrated. Intentional ingestion can lead to toxic levels of nicotine which are associated with cardiac arrhythmias or arrest. Because even a few millilitres can be lethal, nicotine intoxication due to e-liquid ingestion should be considered potentially life-threatening.},

In this regard, Physical Education (PE) serves as a foundation to regular and lifelong participation in PA, mainstream and/or disability sport. Research points towards manifold participation barriers for children with BVI in PE, which so far have mainly been investigated in inclusive settings and from the perspectives of sighted parents, teachers and peers. Consequently, people with BVI frequently consider PE a missed opportunity for lifelong PA. As transitioning from general to special schooling deems the only alternative to continue their education, questions arise in how far and in which ways specialized schools manage to accommodate their needs in PE. To address these gaps in literature, we investigated BVI students' perceived opportunities and barriers to participation in PE within a specialized school setting and their imaginations for possible (digital) improvements and solutions. Within the framework of Inclusive and Youth Participatory Action Research, we adopted the Mosaic Approach to investigate a sample of 19 students aged 14-20 at lower and upper secondary level in a specialized school in Austria. Data material included audio-recordings of interviews, student-guided school tours, photographs of significant places and objects and field protocols. The analysis was conducted with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Through the analysis, we identified three themes. The data material firstly revealed the complex intricacies of how PE teachers can act as facilitators and gatekeepers to autonomous PA. Secondly, material norms function not only as barriers to participation even in a specialized school setting, but also constitute the basis for social hierarchies between students with various degrees of visual impairment. Thirdly, students imagined manifold digital solutions to enhance participation derived from their perceived barriers. The findings contribute to amplifying BVI individuals' voices and provide revealing insights in how participation in PA is enabled and prohibited for students with BVI which can not only help to improve specialized but also inclusive settings.},

Adult ResearchMatch volunteers were invited to join a prospective study where interested individuals were given an opportunity to view details for a study along with participation requirements, then offered a randomly generated compensation amount between $0 and $50 to enroll and participate. Individuals agreeing to participate were then asked to complete tasks using a remote mobile application (MyCap), for two weeks. Tasks included a weekly survey, a daily gratitude journal and daily phone tapping task. Willingness to participate was 85% across all incentive levels but not significantly impacted by amount. Task completion appeared to increase as a function of compensation until a plateau at $25. While participants described the study as low burden and reported that compensation was moderately important to their decision to join, only 31% completed all study tasks. While offering compensation in this study did not have a strong effect on enrollment rate, this work provides insight into participant motivation when joining and participating in studies employing mobile applications.},

Expression in Xenopus oocytes and voltage-clamping allowed the characterization of Arabidopsis GAT2 (At5g41800) as a low affinity GABA transporter with a K0.5GABA ~8 mM. l-Alanine and butylamine represented additional substrates. GABA-induced currents were strongly dependent on the membrane potential, reaching the highest affinity and highest transport rates at strongly negative membrane potentials. Mutation of Ser17, previously reported to be phosphorylated in planta, did not result in altered affinity. In a short-term stress experiment, AtGAT2 mRNA levels were up-regulated at low water potential and under osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol and mannitol). Furthermore, AtGAT2 promoter activity was detected in vascular tissues, maturating pollen, and the phloem unloading region of young seeds. Even though this suggested a role for AtGAT2 in long-distance transport and loading of sink organs, under the conditions tested neither AtGAT2-overexpressing plants, atgat2 or atgat1 T-DNA insertion lines, nor atgat1 atgat2 doubleknockout mutants differed from wild-type plants in growth on GABA, amino acid levels, or resistance to salt and osmotic stress.},

Therefore, the current study explored whether the motivations underlying sexting might help explain the divergence in its positive or negative outcomes. In a longitudinal online study, 405 emerging adults aged 18-29 years (223 women, 171 men, and 21 individuals identifying as non-binary or another gender) participated. All participants had engaged in sexting within the past three months and were in either a casual or committed relationship; they reported their sexting behaviors, autonomous and controlled motivations for sexting, as well as both positive and negative sexting outcomes at two time points, spaced six weeks apart. Structural equation modeling revealed a direct effect of more sexting behaviors (β = 0.13, p = .02) and an indirect effect via greater controlled motives (β = 0.09, p < .001) on more negative sexting outcomes. In contrast, only an indirect effect of more sexting behaviors on more positive sexting outcomes via greater autonomous motives (β = 0.12, p < .001) was observed. Results suggest instead of proclaiming abstinence from sexting, awareness should be increased as to why emerging adults engage in sexting so they can benefit from sexting while limiting any detrimental effects.},

Anesthesiologists of European pediatric cardiac surgical centers. None. Of a total of 98 centers, 50 responded. Eight responses were excluded due to incomplete survey forms or non-European location, leaving 42 responses (42.9%) for statistical analysis. Sixteen of the 42 centers (38.1%) follow an ERAS concept. Only 3 (7.1%) have formalized and detailed the ERAS concept in a written document, covering the entire perioperative period, while 13 (31%) have formalized it solely for the intraoperative period. Regarding regional and local anesthesia, 13 (31%) centers regularly practice regional anesthesia blocks, and 11 (26.2%) centers use wound infiltration by the surgical team. This European survey revealed that implementation of ERAS concepts in pediatric cardiac surgery is generally low, with considerable heterogeneity in clinical practice regarding the timing of extubation, the choice of surgical procedures triggering on-table extubation, the choice of anesthetic drugs and the use of regional anesthesia. More coordinated efforts are needed to implement ERAS concepts in pediatric cardiac surgery and harvest the benefits of ERAS concepts for the pediatric cardiac population.},

Newborn piglets (2.5-10 kg) were randomized to undergo cross-clamp for 60 min with either SACP (n = 9) or SACP+DP (n = 9) followed by 120 min of recovery. Renal biopsies were analysed for histomorphological changes and the induction of hypoxia-related factors. Kidney injury markers were analysed in piglet serum. Histomorphological analyses of renal biopsies after 120-min recovery showed comparable glomeruli area (P = 0.06), glomerular capsule space length (P = 0.25), proximal tubules cell height (P = 0.09) and diameters of proximal tubules (P = 0.23) between SACP and SACP+DP. hypoxia-inducible factor 1α nuclear translocation, a marker for oxidative stress, was higher in the glomeruli (P < 0.01) and proximal tubules (P = 0.05) in the SACP group compared to the SACP+DP group. Serum concentrations of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were higher in the SACP group (100.3 ± 40.8 ng/ml) compared to the SACP+DP group (67.4 ± 19.3 ng/ml, P = 0.03). Our neonate piglet study demonstrated higher oxidative stress in vulnerable nephron structures in renal tissue and higher serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentrations with SACP compared to SACP+DP indicating that SACP+DP is more suitable to reduce renal insult induced by complex aortic arch procedures.},

Computed tomography scans taken immediately postoperatively and 1 year postoperatively of 42 unilateral and of 8 bilateral cleft lip and palate patients who underwent surgery at the age of 9 years (early secondary bone graft) or 12 years (late secondary bone graft) were compared. Three slices from the computed tomography scans taken immediately after the surgery were selected from the center of the bone graft and were then compared with corresponding slices from the 1-year postoperative computed tomography scans. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Wilcoxon 2-sample rank sum test. In the unilateral cleft group, 70% of the transplanted bone remained in the cleft area after 1 year, whereas in the bilateral cleft group, only 45% of the initial bone graft remained after 1 year. No statistically significant difference was found between early secondary bone grafting and late secondary bone grafting. In most cases, a sufficient amount of bone was present in the target area to facilitate eruption of the permanent canine.},

MR scans of 14 surgically treated patients with epilepsy and histologically proven mesial temporal sclerosis were assessed for the presence of six features: feature 1, high signal intensity in the hippocampus; 2, reduced hippocampal size; 3, ipsilateral atrophy of the hippocampal collateral white matter; 4, enlarged temporal horn; 5, reduced gray-white matter demarcation in the temporal lobe; and 6, decreased temporal lobe size. Feature 1 was present in 14 patients and was best appreciated on the T2-weighted images in planes parallel to the long axes of the hippocampi. Feature 2, present in 12 patients, and feature 6, present in 9 patients, were optimally seen in the coronal planes and on the inversion-recovery sequences in particular. Feature 3, present in 12 patients, was optimally seen on the coronal T2-weighted images. Feature 4, seen in 11 patients, was equally well seen in all planes (transverse, coronal, and parallel to the long axes of the hippocampi). Feature 5, seen in 10 patients, was best appreciated on the T2-weighted images in the planes of the long axes of the hippocampi. Histologic investigation of the temporal lobe white matter in the 10 patients with feature 5 demonstrated on the MR scan showed abnormalities in 7 cases. Oligodendroglia cell clusters were found in 6, with concomitant corpora amylacea in 1 case and perivascular macrophages with pigment a sole finding in another case. Of the six features found in cases of mesial temporal sclerosis on MR, increased hippocampal signal intensity is the most consistent. A decreased gray-white matter demarcation in the temporal lobe parenchyma is also a frequent feature of this disease. A combination of multiple scanning planes results in an optimal demonstration of lesions.},

Thirty-three consecutive MR scans were reviewed by a panel of three radiologists. Twenty-three patients had MR abnormalities consistent with MTS, and ten scans were normal. To assess the best single scanning technique, another group of three radiologists, who were masked to all patient data, individually assessed the different planes and sequences of the 33 studies presented separately in a random fashion. For each plane and sequence, the likelihood (L) ratio for the correct diagnosis was determined separately. For all planes considered separately, a likelihood ratio of 4.4 was optimal for the coronal T2-weighted images. The likelihood ratio of APLAH T2 was 2.2; of axial T2, 3.9; of coronal IR, indefinite because of 100% specificity.

  abstract = {Seventy percent of patients with colorectal cancer develop liver metastases (CRLM), which are a decisive factor in cancer progression. Therapy outcome is largely influenced by tumor heterogeneity, but the intra- and inter-patient heterogeneity of CRLM has been poorly studied. In particular, the contribution of the WNT and EGFR pathways, which are both frequently deregulated in colorectal cancer, has not yet been addressed in this context. To this end, we comprehensively characterized normal liver tissue and eight CRLM from two patients by standardized histopathological, molecular, and proteomic subtyping. Suitable fresh-frozen tissue samples were profiled by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and proteomic profiling with reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) combined with bioinformatic analyses to assess tumor heterogeneity and identify WNT- and EGFR-related master regulators and metastatic effectors. A standardized data analysis pipeline for integrating RNA-Seq with clinical, proteomic, and genetic data was established. Dimensionality reduction of the transcriptome data revealed a distinct signature for CRLM differing from normal liver tissue and indicated a high degree of tumor heterogeneity. WNT and EGFR signaling were highly active in CRLM and the genes of both pathways were heterogeneously expressed between the two patients as well as between the synchronous metastases of a single patient. An analysis of the master regulators and metastatic effectors implicated in the regulation of these genes revealed a set of four genes (SFN, IGF2BP1, STAT1, PIK3CG) that were differentially expressed in CRLM and were associated with clinical outcome in a large cohort of colorectal cancer patients as well as CRLM samples. In conclusion, high-throughput profiling enabled us to define a CRLM-specific signature and revealed the genes of the WNT and EGFR pathways associated with inter- and intra-patient heterogeneity, which were validated as prognostic biomarkers in CRC primary tumors as well as liver metastases.},

By means of a fluorescence microscopy platform that allows for the automated detection of the biochemical hallmarks of such a peculiar cell death modality, we identified cardiac glycosides (CGs) as exceptionally efficient inducers of immunogenic cell death, an effect that was associated with the inhibition of the plasma membrane Na(+)- and K(+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase). CGs exacerbated the antineoplastic effects of DNA-damaging agents in immunocompetent but not immunodeficient mice. Moreover, cancer cells succumbing to a combination of chemotherapy plus CGs could vaccinate syngeneic mice against a subsequent challenge with living cells of the same type. Finally, retrospective clinical analyses revealed that the administration of the CG digoxin during chemotherapy had a positive impact on overall survival in cohorts of breast, colorectal, head and neck, and hepatocellular carcinoma patients, especially when they were treated with agents other than anthracyclines and oxaliplatin.},

T-cell immunity is critical for control of CMV infection, and correction of the immune deficiency induced by transplant is now clinically achievable by the adoptive transfer of donor-derived CMV-specific T cells. It is notable, however, that most clinical studies of adoptive T- cell therapy exclude patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) from receiving systemic corticosteroid therapy, which impairs cellular immunity. This group of patients remains the highest clinical risk group for recurrent and problematic infections. Here, we address this unmet clinical need by genetic disruption of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene using electroporation of transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) messenger RNA. We demonstrate efficient inactivation of the GR gene without off-target activity in Streptamer-selected CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells (HLA-A02/NLV peptide), conferring resistance to glucocorticoids. TALEN-modified CMV-specific T cells retained specific killing of target cells pulsed with the CMV peptide NLV in the presence of dexamethasone (DEX). Inactivation of the GR gene also conferred resistance to DEX in a xenogeneic GVHD model in sublethally irradiated NOD-scid IL2rγ(null) mice. This proof of concept provides the rationale for the development of clinical protocols for producing and administering high-purity genetically engineered virus-specific T cells that are resistant to the suppressive effects of corticosteroids.},

The immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment and the expression of immune-inhibitory ligands, such as PD-L1/CD274 by the tumor and stroma are considered key factors limiting efficacy. The addition of checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) to ACT protocols bypasses some mechanisms of immunosuppression, but associated toxicities remain a significant concern. To overcome PD-L1-mediated immunosuppression and reduce CPI-associated toxicities, we used TALEN technology to render tumor-reactive T cells resistant to PD-1 signaling. Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of the PD-1 gene in melanoma-reactive CD8(+) T cells and in fibrosarcoma-reactive polyclonal T cells enhanced the persistence of PD-1 gene-modified T cells at the tumor site and increased tumor control. These results illustrate the feasibility and potency of approaches incorporating advanced gene-editing technologies into ACT protocols to silence immune checkpoints as a strategy to overcome locally active immune escape pathways.

It is currently unknown whether estradiol also interacts with orexigenic compounds implicated in the physiological control of food intake. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to determine whether estradiol decreases the orexigenic effect of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a neuropeptide that, like estradiol, appears to influence food intake by selectively affecting the controls of meal size. Food and water intake were monitored following lateral ventricular (icv) infusions of 5 mug MCH or saline vehicle in oil- and estradiol-treated ovariectomized rats. MCH increased food intake throughout the first 4 h of the dark phase in oil-treated rats, but only for the last 2 h of the same 4-h interval in estradiol-treated rats. As a result, the orexigenic effect of MCH was significantly lower in estradiol-treated rats, relative to oil-treated rats. During this interval of MCH-stimulated feeding, a prandial increase in water intake was not observed in either oil- or estradiol-treated rats. We conclude that estradiol decreases the orexigenic effect of MCH in ovariectomized rats.},

Direct immunofluorescence with 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was performed to analyze keratocytes/area in the anterior, middle, posterior, peripheral, and central corneal stroma. The period between CXL and keratoplasty ranged from 5 to 30 months. All keratoconus corneas showed the typical histological changes. Increased proapoptotic BAX expression and/or antiapoptotic survivin expression were noticed in keratocytes and endothelium in 2 keratoconus specimens after CXL. Smooth muscle actin was only observed in subepithelial scar tissue of 2 keratoconus corneas without CXL. Keratoconus corneas after CXL revealed a significant reduction in keratocyte counts in the entire cornea (P = 0.003) compared with keratoconus corneas without CXL and normal corneas. This difference was because of a loss of keratocytes in the anterior (P = 0.014) and middle (P = 0.024) corneal stroma. Keratocytes in CXL corneas were reduced in the center (P = 0.028) and the periphery (P = 0.047). CXL in human keratoconus can cause considerable morphologic corneal changes up to 30 months postoperatively. Especially noteworthy is a long-lasting, maybe permanent, keratocyte loss in the anterior and middle corneal stroma involving the central and peripheral cornea. As long-term corneal damage after CXL is of genuine concern, particular care should be taken to perform this procedure only in accordance with investigational protocols.},

BIS was monitored in three volunteers by using an Aspect A-1000 monitor. The experiment was repeated in one volunteer. Electromyographic activity was recorded. Alcuronium and succinylcholine were administered. No other drugs were used. In parallel with spontaneous electromyographic activity of the facial muscles, BIS decreased in response to muscle relaxation to a minimum value of 33 and, in the repeated measurement, to a minimum value of 9 when total neuromuscular block was achieved. In two volunteers, no total block was achieved. BIS decreased to a minimal value of 64 and 57, respectively. In turn, recovery of BIS coincided with the reappearance of spontaneous electromyographic activity. During the entire experiment, the volunteers had full consciousness. BIS, assessed by software Version 3.31, correlates with spontaneous electromyographic activity of the facial muscles. BIS failed to detect awareness in completely paralyzed subjects. Thus, in paralyzed patients, BIS monitoring may not reliably indicate a decline in sedation and imminent awareness. The bispectral index (BIS) is an electroencephalographic variable intended for measuring depth of anesthesia. Electromyographic activity influences the calculation of BIS. We found that the administration of a muscle relaxant to unanesthetized volunteers decreases the bispectral index value. Thus, awareness in totally paralyzed patients cannot be excluded.},

  abstract = {Recently, BRCA1 germline mutations were found in a high proportion (14-34%) of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). BRCA2 was either not analyzed or showed much lower mutation frequencies. Therefore, we screened a group of TNBC patients (n = 30) of white European descent for mutations in BRCA2 as well as in BRCA1. Cases were unselected for age of disease-onset (median age at breast cancer diagnosis was 58 years, ranging from 37 to 74 years), family history of cancer and BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status. Half of the patients (15/30) showed a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. A high frequency of deleterious germline mutations was observed in BRCA2 (5/30; 16.7%), and only one case showed a BRCA1 mutation (3.3%). Although the study group was small, these results point to BRCA2 mutations being important in TNBC.},

This may provide a powerful strategy for plants to adapt to environmental change. However, as epigenetic changes do not modify DNA sequences and are therefore reversible, only those epi-mutations that are transmitted through the germline can be expected to contribute to a long-term adaptive response. The major challenge for the investigation of epigenetic adaptation theories is therefore to identify genomic loci that undergo epigenetic changes in response to environmental conditions, which alter their expression in a heritable way and which improve the plant's ability to adapt to the inducing conditions. This review focuses on the role of DNA methylation as a prominent epigenetic mark that controls chromatin conformation, and on its potential in mediating expression changes in response to environmental signals.},

We studied species richness and the similarity of community composition. Additionally, we grouped species by their frequency trend over time to successional model types to examine whether, corresponding to the IDH, the diversity of these groups explained peak richness at intermediate intervals after the disturbance. In line with the IDH, species richness showed a hump-backed temporal course for alpha and gamma diversity. We found evidence for a linear succession directly after the disturbance. This, however, did not continue, and in all species groups, a partial recovery of the initial community was observed. In the case of fungi, herbs, and trees, but not for saproxylic beetles, alpha diversity was driven by the diversity of the successional model types. Our results underline that the mechanisms driving species richness after disturbances are more complex than the IDH suggests and that these mechanisms vary with species group. We assumed that, besides competition, legacy effects, facilitation, habitat heterogeneity, and random saturation of the species pool are important. In case of trees and herbs, we found indications for strong legacy and competition effects. For fungi and beetles, substrate heterogeneity and microclimate were assumed to be important. We concluded that disturbances contribute to increasing species richness not only by reducing the effectiveness of competitors but also by increasing the amount and diversity of resources, as well as their rate of change over time.},

Perioperative mortality (60-day mortality) was 7.2% for CKD stage 1/2, 12.4% for CKD stage 3, and 19.8% for CKD stage 4/5. Patients with PAD stage IV had significantly higher perioperative mortality (10.3%) than patients with PAD stage III (4.5%).

While scalp recordings have contributed to understanding the psychological processes underlying the N400, they have been limited in identifying its neural basis. However, recent intracranial ERP recordings and fMRI studies have shed light on the crucial role of the anterior medial temporal lobe (AMTL) in semantic information processing. These findings suggest that the N400 partially represents activity in the AMTL structures. To investigate the neural underpinnings of the N400 effect, we simultaneously recorded ERPs and event-related fMRI during a semantic priming paradigm in a sample of 12 young, healthy subjects. Additionally, we collected ERPs and structural brain data from older healthy adults and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a population characterized by neurodegenerative changes in the AMTL. In our fMRI results, we identified bilateral loci in the AMTL as the global maxima. Employing an EEG-informed fMRI analysis, we explored trial-to-trial fluctuations in semantic processing by linking single-trial N400 amplitudes to the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. This approach provided the first direct evidence linking the N400 recorded at the scalp level to the corresponding BOLD signal in the AMTL. Consistent with these findings, patients with aMCI exhibited a diminished N400 effect compared to healthy older adults. Furthermore, voxel-based morphometry analysis revealed a correlation between the magnitude of the N400 effect and the integrity of the AMTL. By integrating data from simultaneous EEG-fMRI, and patient studies, our research advances our understanding of the neural substrate of the N400 and highlights the critical involvement of the AMTL in semantic processing.},

Using MetaNetX and eMolecules as databases of natural compounds and commercially available chemicals, the deterministic algorithm benchmarks a Transformer-based generative model trained to predict SMILES from ECFPs. The generative model achieves a top-ranked retrieval accuracy of 95.64% but struggles with exhaustive enumeration. Additionally, applying the deterministic method to a drug dataset reveals its potential for de novo drug design, as many of the reverse-engineered structures are found to be patented or supported by bioassay data.},

In this study, we aimed to comprehensively characterize cognitive impairment associated with COVID-19 using a large online cohort of over 1400 participants, including individuals reporting a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and individuals who had never been tested positive. Our cognitive test battery covered alertness, executive functions, and episodic long-term memory. Our results demonstrate a pronounced and selective impairment of individuals previously infected in a mnemonic discrimination task known to engage hippocampus-dependent pattern separation. This impairment remained statistically significant after controlling for potential confounding factors (i.e., age, gender, education, depressiveness, anxiety, and stress). This finding, derived indirectly from behavioral performance, suggests compromised hippocampal neurogenesis following infection, which may contribute to COVID-related memory deficits. Our study has important implications for understanding the neurofunctional consequences of COVID-19 and highlights the potential significance of neuroinflammation in the manifestation of cognitive impairments.},

In response to chemotherapy, autophagy-competent, but not autophagy-deficient, cancers attracted dendritic cells and T lymphocytes into the tumor bed. Suppression of autophagy inhibited the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from dying tumor cells. Conversely, inhibition of extracellular ATP-degrading enzymes increased pericellular ATP in autophagy-deficient tumors, reestablished the recruitment of immune cells, and restored chemotherapeutic responses but only in immunocompetent hosts. Thus, autophagy is essential for the immunogenic release of ATP from dying cells, and increased extracellular ATP concentrations improve the efficacy of antineoplastic chemotherapies when autophagy is disabled.},

The results showed that: (1) during phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC) the frequency and duration of contractions showed a significant decrease in the duodenum for WS(R) 1340; (2) WS(R) 1520 significantly reduced the contraction amplitudes in the duodenum during phase I and II of the MMC; (3) trends for decreased values were seen for WS(R) 1340 in the gastric corpus and duodenum and for WS(R) 1520 in the gastric antrum; (4) in the gastric corpus the duration of contractions was significantly reduced after application of WS(R) 1340 during phases I and II of the MMC; (5) WS(R) 1520 significantly reduced the contraction amplitudes and the duration of contractions in the gastric corpus during phase III of the MMC; (6) for the hydrophobic phase a moderate but significant decrease of duration of contractions in the duodenum and of frequency of contractions in the gastric corpus was seen.

However, the short-term repeatability of transcerebral double-indicator dilution measurements has not yet been investigated. The present study was designed to investigate the accuracy in terms of reliability for repeated transcerebral double-indicator dilution measurements to assess global cerebral blood flow during a definite carbon dioxide challenge in a clinical trial. The investigation was performed in 10 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting. After induction of anaesthesia, repeated cerebral blood flow measurements using transcerebral double-indicator dilution were performed during target normocapnia, hypocapnia and hypercapnia. For transcerebral double-indicator dilution measurements, a bolus injection of ice-cold indocyanine green was administered into a central vein. The resulting thermal dye dilution curves were recorded simultaneously in the aorta and the jugular bulb using combined fibreoptic thermistor catheters. Cerebral blood flow was calculated from the mean transit times of the indicators through the brain. Additionally, transcranial Doppler sonography was simultaneously performed to measure transient changes in the cerebral blood flow velocity. Transcerebral double-indicator dilution measurements revealed a reasonable coefficient of repeatability with 9.1, 9.7 and 20.2 mL min-1 100 g-1 during normo-, hypo- and hypercapnic conditions, respectively. However, a total of 20% of the administered measurements had to be rejected for methodological reasons. Repeated measurements with the transcerebral double-indicator dilution method show a reasonable repeatability. With consideration to the limitations of the transcerebral double-indicator dilution technique, this new method proves to be a reliable monitoring tool to measure global cerebral blood flow at the bedside.},

  abstract = {The existence of naturally occurring ribosome heterogeneity is now a well-acknowledged phenomenon. However, whether this heterogeneity leads to functionally diverse 'specialized ribosomes' is still a controversial topic. Here, we explore the biological function of RPL3L (uL3L), a ribosomal protein (RP) paralogue of RPL3 (uL3) that is exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle and heart tissues, by generating a viable homozygous Rpl3l knockout mouse strain. We identify a rescue mechanism in which, upon RPL3L depletion, RPL3 becomes up-regulated, yielding RPL3-containing ribosomes instead of RPL3L-containing ribosomes that are typically found in cardiomyocytes. Using both ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and a novel orthogonal approach consisting of ribosome pulldown coupled to nanopore sequencing (Nano-TRAP), we find that RPL3L modulates neither translational efficiency nor ribosome affinity towards a specific subset of transcripts. In contrast, we show that depletion of RPL3L leads to increased ribosome-mitochondria interactions in cardiomyocytes, which is accompanied by a significant increase in ATP levels, potentially as a result of fine-tuning of mitochondrial activity. Our results demonstrate that the existence of tissue-specific RP paralogues does not necessarily lead to enhanced translation of specific transcripts or modulation of translational output. Instead, we reveal a complex cellular scenario in which RPL3L modulates the expression of RPL3, which in turn affects ribosomal subcellular localization and, ultimately, mitochondrial activity.},

  abstract = {Translational initiation factor 2 (IF2) is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that can bind guanosine 3',5'-(bis) diphosphate (ppGpp), an alarmone involved in stringent response in bacteria. In cells growing under optimal conditions, the GTP concentration is very high, and that of ppGpp very low. However, under stress conditions, the GTP concentration may decline by as much as 50%, and that of ppGpp can attain levels comparable to those of GTP. Here we show that IF2 binds ppGpp at the same nucleotide-binding site and with similar affinity as GTP. Thus, GTP and the alarmone ppGpp can be considered two alternative physiologically relevant IF2 ligands. ppGpp interferes with IF2-dependent initiation complex formation, severely inhibits initiation dipeptide formation, and blocks the initiation step of translation. Our data suggest that IF2 has the properties of a cellular metabolic sensor and regulator that oscillates between an active GTP-bound form under conditions allowing active protein syntheses and an inactive ppGpp-bound form when shortage of nutrients would be detrimental, if not accompanied by slackening of this synthesis.},

An observational retrospective cohort study.

Bacterial disease was suspected or confirmed in only 71% of all the patients with suspected sepsis (2008 definition) and consequently treated with antibiotics. Most of these patients (58%) suffered from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) without signs of organ dysfunction, hypotension or hypoperfusion. Despite absence of bacterial disease in 29% of the patients after rigorous diagnostics, median antibiotic treatment in this group was still seven days (IQR 4-10). Standard sepsis detection using SIRS criteria and clinical suspicion identified patients with suspected or confirmed bacterial disease in 71% of the cases. A significant proportion of patients were exposed to prolonged antibiotic use without proof of bacterial disease. This study illustrates the difficulties in correctly identifying bacterial disease and sepsis, and shows that overuse of antibiotics may be the consequence.},

Due to its characteristic scent, it is frequently used in dairy products, tea drinks and fine fragrances. The demand for natural indole by the flavor and fragrance industry is high, yet, its abundance in essential oils isolated from plants such as jasmine and narcissus is low. Thus, there is a strong demand for a sustainable method to produce food-grade indole. Here, we established the biotechnological production of indole upon L-tryptophan supplementation in the bacterial host Corynebacterium glutamicum. Heterologous expression of the tryptophanase gene from E. coli enabled the conversion of supplemented L-tryptophan to indole. Engineering of the substrate import by co-expression of the native aromatic amino acid permease gene aroP increased whole-cell biotransformation of L-tryptophan to indole by two-fold. Indole production to 0.2 g L The bioconversion production process established in this study provides an attractive route for sustainable indole production from tryptophan in C. glutamicum. Industrially relevant indole titers were achieved within 24 h and indole was concentrated in the organic layer as a pure product after the fermentation.},

It is used in dairy products, tea drinks, and fine fragrances due to its distinct floral odor typical of jasmine blossoms. The current production of indole based on isolation from coal tar is non-sustainable and its isolation from plants is often unprofitable due to low yields. To offer an alternative to the conventional production, biosynthesis of indole has been studied recently. A glucose-based indole production was achieved by employing the Corynebacterium glutamicum tryptophan synthase α-subunit (TrpA) or indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase (IGL) from wheat Triticum aestivum in a genetically-engineered C. glutamicum strain. In addition, a highly efficient bioconversion process using C. glutamicum heterologously expressing tryptophanase gene (tnaA) from Providencia rettgeri as a biocatalyst was developed. In this work, de novo indole production from glucose was enabled by expressing the P. rettgeri tnaA in a tryptophan-producing C. glutamicum strain.

The etiologies range from idiopathic/sarcomeric forms to syndromic diseases, neuromuscular disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism, but cause-specific outcomes remain incompletely understood. This study analyzed the clinical course of a large cohort of children with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), stratified by etiology. Patients clinically diagnosed with HCM before 18 years of age at Heidelberg University Hospital, Germany (2000-2024) were included (n = 146). The clinical data were compiled by the Medical Data Integration Center and supplemented by manual data extraction. Outcomes included survival, myectomy, ICD and PPM implantation, arrhythmias, heart transplantation, cardiac arrest, and echocardiographic features at first presentation. Of 146 patients, 31.5% (n = 46) were followed into adulthood. HCM etiologies included idiopathic/sarcomeric (37%, n = 54), inborn errors of metabolism (21.2%, n = 31), RASopathy (15.7%, n = 23), neuromuscular disorders (6.8%, n = 10), other syndromic (6.2%, n = 9), and other (13%, n = 19). Diagnosis was made in infancy (< 1 year) (47.3%, n = 69), childhood (1-18 years) (40.4%, n = 59), or was confirmed before age 18 without specific timing available (12.3%, n = 18). Early diagnosis correlated with syndromic and multisystem disease. The echocardiographic findings and clinical outcomes varied by etiology. During a mean follow-up of 13.6 ± 10.5 years, 11% (n = 16) died, with 62.5% (n = 10) of deaths occurring within the first two years of life. Survival was highest in idiopathic/sarcomeric HCM (96.7%) and lower in neuromuscular (85.7%), syndromic (76.2%), inborn errors of metabolism (70.5%), RASopathy (57.8%), and other forms (54.2%). Death frequently involved non-cardiovascular causes. Infants had higher early mortality, which normalized among those surviving beyond two years. In idiopathic/sarcomeric HCM, outcomes did not differ between those diagnosed in infancy versus later childhood. Reduced ejection fraction and elevated NT-proBNP levels were predictive of mortality, while the use of Class IV anti-arrhythmics was associated with improved survival. The results of this analysis show significant variability of outcomes by HCM subtype in children. Idiopathic/sarcomeric and neuromuscular disease-associated HCM had the best prognosis, while other non-idiopathic/non-sarcomeric forms of HCM showed worse outcomes. Pediatric HCM presents with diverse underlying causes, unique phenotypes, and clinical trajectories, requiring tailored treatment approaches.},

A retrospective observational cohort study SETTING: This single-center study was performed at the University Medical Center Groningen. All pediatric patients up to 10 kg undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Procedures in which FFP was used for CPB priming were compared with those in which Omniplasma was used. The primary outcome parameter was a composite endpoint consisting of the following: (1) pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) mortality, (2) thromboembolic complications, and (3) hemorrhagic complications during PICU stay. The authors included 143 procedures in the analyses, 90 (63%) in the FFP group and 53 (37%) in the Omniplasma group. The occurrence of the combined primary endpoint (FFP 20% v Omniplasma 11%, p = 0.18) and its components did not differ between the used CPB priming agent). Omniplasma for CPB priming was associated with decreased unfractionated heparin administration per kg bodyweight (585 IU v 510 IU, p = 0.03), higher preoperative and postoperative activated clotting times (ACT) discrepancy (90% v 94%, p = 0.03), a lower postoperative ACT value (125 v 118 seconds, p = 0.01), and less red blood cell transfusion per kilogram bodyweight (78 v 55 mL, p = 0.02). However, none of the variables differed statistically significantly in the multivariate logistic regression analyses. The authors did not find an association between the plasma used for CPB priming and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications and death in neonates and infants undergoing cardiac surgery. Omniplasma seems to be safe to use in this population.},

Refugees, both adults and children, have a high risk of developing mental health disorders, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety disorders. Research into the mental health of Ukrainian families and their needs is urgently needed. The primary aim of this study is to increase our understanding of the consequences of potentially traumatic events for the mental health of parents and children. This may inform the development of mental health and psychosocial support interventions which can be readily implemented in the family context. We will conduct a four-wave longitudinal online survey study among Ukrainian families displaced to the Netherlands. This study is a part of the Nadiya data collection, intended to assess the mental health responses of Ukrainian refugee families to the stress of war, forced migration, family separation and adaptation to new circumstances in their hosting country. Participants are assessed at four time points, approximately 6 months apart. Data collection for T1 started in May 2023. We aim to recruit a total of n=1500 participants at T1, of which n=1000 adults (18 years and older) and n=500 children (8-11 years) and teenagers (12-17 years). To investigate symptom profiles and associated risk and protective factors among parents and children, we will use latent class growth modelling.

Bats, cavity-nesting birds, arboreal marsupials, and many different saproxylic species depend on habitat trees and their great variety of microhabitats and old-growth characteristics. With a focus on insights from temperate forests, we traced the development of habitat-tree protection over 200 years. The idea was first conceptualized by foresters and natural scientists in the early 19th century. At that time, utilitarian conservation aimed to protect cavity trees that provided roosts and nesting holes for insectivorous bats and birds. By the second half of the 19th century, habitat-tree protection was well known to foresters and was occasionally implemented. Knowledge of the protection of large old trees, a special kind of habitat tree, for sociocultural and aesthetic reasons developed similarly. But, many foresters of that time and in the following decades fundamentally rejected protection of habitat trees for economic reasons. Beginning in the 1970s, forest conservation and integrative forest management became increasingly important issues worldwide. Since then, the protection of habitat trees has been implemented on a large scale. Long-term views on the development of conservation concepts are important to inform the implementation of conservation today. In particular, historical analyses of conservation concepts allow the testing of long-term conservation outcomes and make it possible to study the resilience of conservation approaches to changing social or ecological conditions. We encourage all conservation ecologists to assess the practical and conceptual impact of the initial ideas that led to modern conservation concepts in terms of long-term biodiversity conservation.},

PPHN was present in 31% of patients. Overall mortality was 8.1%, with no difference between PPHN and non-PPHN patients (9.7 v 7.4%, p = 0.70). PPHN had no effect on morbidity outcomes. A lower weight at birth was associated with preoperative mortality. Duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative hypotension were associated with longer intensive care unit stay. Intraoperative hypotension and cerebral oxygen desaturation had no significant impact on mortality. PPHN did not significantly affect perioperative morbidity and mortality in d-TGA patients, suggesting a more favorable prognosis than previously reported.},

  abstract = {Mitral regurgitation (MR) can occasionally mimic aortic stenosis (AS) on echocardiographic Doppler imaging, leading to diagnostic challenges. We present the case of a 55-year-old man undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery for severe MR caused by posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe MR with no significant aortic valve abnormalities. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) initially showed a high transvalvular aortic gradient (3 m/s) in the transgastric long-axis view, suggestive of mild-to-moderate AS. However, detailed Doppler analysis revealed a double envelope signal, representing both eccentric MR and true aortic valve flow. The closer evaluation showed the MR signal occurred earlier in the cardiac cycle, aligning with its hemodynamic timing, while the true aortic flow followed isovolumetric contraction. Subsequent three-dimensional TEE confirmed normal aortic valve morphology and function. This case highlights the importance of correlating preoperative findings, Doppler signal timing, and imaging data to avoid misdiagnosis. Systematic echocardiographic evaluation, including signal timing analysis, can differentiate between MR and AS, ensuring accurate intraoperative decision-making and preventing unnecessary interventions.},

Patient morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease can be reduced by more accurate and continuous diagnostic and therapeutic tools provided by cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). Long-term operation of CIEDs continues to be a challenge due to limited battery life and the associated risk of device failure. To overcome this issue, new approaches for autonomous battery supply are being investigated. Here, the state of the art in CIED power supply is presented and an overview of current strategies for autonomous power supply in the cardiovascular field is given, using the body as a sustainable energy source. Finally, future challenges and potentials as well as advanced features for CIEDs are discussed. CIEDs need to fulfil more requirements for diagnostic and telemetric functions, which leads to higher energy requirements. Ongoing miniaturization and improved sensor technologies will help in the development of new devices.},

Electrophysiological assessments of α1β2γ2 receptors revealed that 25/26 variants caused dysfunction to core receptor properties such as GABA sensitivity. Of these, 17 resulted in gain-of-function (GOF) while eight yielded loss-of-function traits (LOF). Genotype-phenotype correlation analysis revealed that individuals harbouring GOF variants suffered from severe developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 74%), movement disorders such as dystonia or dyskinesia (59%), microcephaly (50%) and high risk of early mortality (26%). Conversely, LOF variants were associated with milder disease manifestations. Individuals with these variants typically exhibited fever-triggered seizures (92%), milder degrees of DD/ID (85%), and maintained ambulatory function (85%). Notably, severe movement disorders or microcephaly were not reported in individuals with loss-of-function variants. The data reveals that genetic variants in GABRB2 can lead to both gain and loss-of-function, and this divergence is correlated with distinct disease manifestations. Utilising this information, we constructed a diagnostic flowchart that aids in predicting the pathogenicity of recently identified variants by considering clinical phenotypes.

  abstract = {Thrombus imaging characteristics are associated with treatment success and functional outcomes in stroke patients. However, assessing these characteristics based on manual annotations is labor intensive and subject to observer bias. Therefore, we aimed to create an automated pipeline for consistent and fast full thrombus segmentation. We used multi-center, multi-scanner datasets of anterior circulation stroke patients with baseline NCCT and CTA for training (n = 228) and testing (n = 100). We first found the occlusion location using StrokeViewer LVO and created a bounding box around it. Subsequently, we trained dual modality U-Net based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to segment the thrombus inside this bounding box. We experimented with: (1) U-Net with two input channels for NCCT and CTA, and U-Nets with two encoders where (2) concatenate, (3) add, and (4) weighted-sum operators were used for feature fusion. Furthermore, we proposed a dynamic bounding box algorithm to adjust the bounding box. The dynamic bounding box algorithm reduces the missed cases but does not improve Dice. The two-encoder U-Net with a weighted-sum feature fusion shows the best performance (surface Dice 0.78, Dice 0.62, and 4% missed cases). Final segmentation results have high spatial accuracies and can therefore be used to determine thrombus characteristics and potentially benefit radiologists in clinical practice.},

Given the availability of flexible software for analyzing longitudinal sequences of unequal length, implementation of likelihood-based MAR analyses is not limited by computational considerations. While such analyses are valid under the comparatively weak assumption of MAR, the possibility of data missing not at random (MNAR) is difficult to rule out. It is argued, however, that MNAR analyses are, themselves, surrounded with problems and therefore, rather than ignoring MNAR analyses altogether or blindly shifting to them, their optimal place is within sensitivity analysis. The concepts developed here are illustrated using data from three clinical trials, where it is shown that the analysis method may have an impact on the conclusions of the study.},

After 6 months, biopsies were taken to histologically analyze the percentage of BSM, connective tissue (CT), and newly formed bone (NFB) following both approaches. Forty implants were placed and 29 harvested biopsies could be evaluated. Duration of surgery, membrane perforations, and VAS were detected.

This is limiting for many experiments where low-level access to machine control, experiment data, or custom instrument setups is necessary. Over the past decade, advancements in off-the-shelf detector systems, fast data bus systems, and the availability of high-level programming languages such as Python have made it feasible to design and construct atom probe systems without extensive engineering expertise. Despite this progress, developing control system software, associated instruments, and data calibration algorithms remains a significant challenge for many projects. In this article, we introduce an atom probe control system that can be flexibly adapted to various hardware configurations. This system also includes essential instrument and experiment calibration algorithms, offering complete transparency to the user. This framework provides flexibility for innovative experiments and enhances calibration accuracy not possible with commercial systems. The methods and algorithms discussed are implemented in Python Control and Calibration for Atom Probe Tomography (PyCCAPT), which is an open-source solution for APT, addressing a gap in experimental control and data processing. While not compatible with commercial atom probes for data acquisition, its calibration module can be used for direct-flight-path systems and adapted for reflection-based instruments.},

The toxin Kid inhibits cell growth by RNA degradation and its action is neutralized by the formation of a tight complex with the antitoxin Kis. A fascinating but poorly understood aspect of the kid-kis system is its autoregulation at the transcriptional level. Using macromolecular (tandem) mass spectrometry and DNA binding assays, we here demonstrate that Kis pilots the interaction of the Kid-Kis complex in the parD regulatory region and that two discrete Kis-binding regions are present on parD. The data clearly show that only when the Kis concentration equals or exceeds the Kid concentration a strong cooperative effect exists between strong DNA binding and Kid2-Kis2-Kid2-Kis2 complex formation. We propose a model in which transcriptional repression of the parD operon is tuned by the relative molar ratio of the antitoxin and toxin proteins in solution. When the concentration of the toxin exceeds that of the antitoxin tight Kid2-Kis2-Kid2 complexes are formed, which only neutralize the lethal activity of Kid. Upon increasing the Kis concentration, (Kid2-Kis2)n complexes repress the kid-kis operon.},

Registered data included patient demographics, operator background, advanced life support interventions, and timelines. Resuscitation performance was evaluated according to the 2015 European Resuscitation Guidelines. Seven patients underwent a prehospital PCD. Three mothers died on the scene, while four were transported to a hospital but died in the hospital. Seven neonates were born by PCD. One neonate died on the scene and six were transported to a hospital. Three neonates were eventually discharged from the hospital. Among the three surviving neonates, the periods from dispatch to start of PCD were 13, 14, and 21 min. There was a low incidence of maternal perimortem caesarean deliveries in The Netherlands. Only some neonates survived after PCD. It is recommended that PCD be performed as quickly as possible. Due to the delay, the mother has a far lower chance of survival than the neonate. In fatal cases, autopsy is strongly recommended.},

This study assessed whether the addition of aprepitant to a multimodal regimen would further decrease the incidence of PONV in high-risk patients. Apfel-score three or four patients, scheduled for laparoscopic procedures to treat abdominal or pelvic cancer, were randomized to receive oral starch (control group) or 80 mg of oral aprepitant (treatment group) before induction of anaesthesia in a double-blind study. All patients received 4-8 mg of intravenous dexamethasone (at induction) and 4-8 mg of ondansetron (at the end) and a standardized total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) technique combined with neuraxial blockade. PONV was defined as any episode of nausea, vomiting or retching in the first 24 h after anaesthesia. Sixty-six patients completed the study. Vomiting occurred in 13/32 (40.6%) patients in the control group and in 1/34 (2.9%) patients in the treatment group (P = 0.0002, 95%CI: 18-54%) in the first 24 h after anaesthesia. Severe nausea occurred in two (6.3%) patients, and severe vomiting occurred in four (12.5%) patients in the control group. One patient presented with severe vomiting in the treatment group in the first 24 post-operative hours. Eighty milligrams of aprepitant added to a three-drug multimodal prophylaxis strategy can bring benefits to a high-risk population by reducing PONV episodes and rescue antiemetic requirements.

We hypothesized that skin temperature in a specific limb could be disrupted by psychologically disrupting the sense of ownership of that limb. In six separate experiments, and by using an established protocol to induce the rubber hand illusion, we demonstrate that skin temperature of the real hand decreases when we take ownership of an artificial counterpart. The decrease in skin temperature is limb-specific: it does not occur in the unstimulated hand, nor in the ipsilateral foot. The effect is not evoked by tactile or visual input per se, nor by simultaneous tactile and visual input per se, nor by a shift in attention toward the experimental side or limb. In fact, taking ownership of an artificial hand slows tactile processing of information from the real hand, which is also observed in patients who demonstrate body disownership after stroke. These findings of psychologically induced limb-specific disruption of temperature regulation provide the first evidence that: taking ownership of an artificial body part has consequences for the real body part; that the awareness of our physical self and the physiological regulation of self are closely linked in a top-down manner; and that cognitive processes that disrupt the sense of body ownership may in turn disrupt temperature regulation in numerous states characterized by both.},

Since decreased cardiac expression of S100A1 is a characteristic of heart failure, we tested the hypothesis that S100A1 gene transfer could restore contractile function of failing myocardium. Adenoviral S100A1 gene delivery normalized S100A1 protein expression in a postinfarction rat heart failure model and reversed contractile dysfunction of failing myocardium in vivo and in vitro. S100A1 gene transfer to failing cardiomyocytes restored diminished intracellular Ca2+ transients and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load mechanistically due to increased SR Ca2+ uptake and reduced SR Ca2+ leak. Moreover, S100A1 gene transfer decreased elevated intracellular Na+ concentrations to levels detected in nonfailing cardiomyocytes, reversed reactivated fetal gene expression, and restored energy supply in failing cardiomyocytes. Intracoronary adenovirus-mediated S100A1 gene delivery in vivo to the postinfarcted failing rat heart normalized myocardial contractile function and Ca2+ handling, which provided support in a physiological context for results found in myocytes. Thus, the present study demonstrates that restoration of S100A1 protein levels in failing myocardium by gene transfer may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of heart failure.},

  abstract = {Calcium is a key regulator of cardiac function and is modulated through the Ca2+-sensor protein S100A1. S100 proteins are considered to exert both intracellular and extracellular functions on their target cells. Here we report the impact of an increased intracellular S100A1 protein level on Ca2+-homeostasis in neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes in vitro. Specifically, we compare the effects of exogenously added recombinant S100A1 to those resulting from the overexpression of a transduced S100A1 gene. Extracellularly added S100A1 enhanced the Ca2+-transient amplitude in neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes (NVCMs) through a marked decrease in intracellular diastolic Ca2+-concentrations ([Ca2+]i). The decrease in [Ca2+]i was independent of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) activity and was probably the result of an increased sarcolemmal Ca2+-extrusion through the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX). At the same time the Ca2+-content of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) decreased. These effects were dependent on the uptake of extracellularly added S100A1 protein and its subsequent routing to the endosomal compartment. Phospholipase C and protein kinase C, which are tightly associated with this subcellular compartment, were found to be activated by endocytosed S100A1. By contrast, adenoviral-mediated intracellular S100A1 overexpression enhanced the Ca2+-transient amplitude in NVCMs mainly through an increase in systolic [Ca2+]i. The increased Ca2+-load in the SR was based on an enhanced SERCA2a activity while NCX function was unaltered. Overexpressed S100A1 colocalized with SERCA2a and other Ca2+-regulatory proteins at the SR, whereas recombinant S100A1 protein that had been endocytosed did not colocalize with SR proteins. This study provides the first evidence that intracellular S100A1, depending on its subcellular location, modulates cardiac Ca2+-turnover via different Ca2+-regulatory proteins.},

Because S100A1 has recently been identified as a Ca2+-dependent inotropic factor in the heart, this study sought to explore the pathophysiological relevance of S100A1 levels in development and progression of postischemic heart failure (HF). S100A1-transgenic (STG) and S100A1-knockout (SKO) mice were subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) by surgical left anterior descending coronary artery ligation, and survival, cardiac function, and remodeling were compared with nontransgenic littermate control (NLC) and wild-type (WT) animals up to 4 weeks. Although MI size was similar in all groups, infarcted S100A1-deficient hearts (SKO-MI) responded with acute contractile decompensation and accelerated transition to HF, rapid onset of cardiac remodeling with augmented apoptosis, and excessive mortality. NLC/WT-MI mice, displaying a progressive decrease in cardiac S100A1 expression, showed a later onset of cardiac remodeling and progression to HF. Infarcted S100A1-overexpressing hearts (STG-MI), however, showed preserved global contractile performance, abrogated apoptosis, and prevention from cardiac hypertrophy and HF with superior survival compared with NLC/WT-MI and SKO-MI. Both Gq-protein-dependent signaling and protein kinase C activation resulted in decreased cardiac S100A1 mRNA and protein levels, whereas Gs-protein-related signaling exerted opposite effects on cardiac S100A1 abundance. Mechanistically, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ cycling and beta-adrenergic signaling were severely impaired in SKO-MI myocardium but preserved in STG-MI. Our novel proof-of-concept study provides evidence that downregulation of S100A1 protein critically contributes to contractile dysfunction of the diseased heart, which is potentially responsible for driving the progressive downhill clinical course of patients with HF.},

The construction of the microswimmer has the following features: (i) it is a bilayer ribbon with a length of 80 or 120 [Formula: see text]m, consisting of a thermo-responsive hydrogel of poly-N-isopropylamide coated with a 2-nm layer of gold and equipped with homogeneously dispersed gold nanorods; (ii) the width of the ribbon is linearly tapered with a wider end of 5 [Formula: see text]m and a tip of 0.5 [Formula: see text]m; (iii) a thickness of only 1 and 2 [Formula: see text]m that ensures a maximum variation of the cross section of the ribbon along its length from square to rectangular. These wedge-shaped ribbons form conical helices when the hydrogel is swollen in cold water and extend to a filament-like object when the temperature is raised above the volume phase transition of the hydrogel at [Formula: see text]. The two ends of these ribbons undergo different but coupled modes of motion upon fast temperature cycling through plasmonic heating of the gel-objects from inside. Proper choice of the IR-light pulse sequence caused the ribbons to move at a rate of 6 body length/s (500 [Formula: see text]m/s) with the wider end ahead. Within the confinement of rectangular container of 30 [Formula: see text]m height and 300 [Formula: see text]m width, the different modes can be actuated in a way that the movement is directed by the energy input between spinning on the spot and fast forward locomotion.},

As the indications for RTSA continue to expand, the role of RTSA in patients aged >70 years with glenohumeral arthritis and an intact rotator cuff remains unclear. To study the New Zealand Joint Registry (NZJR) and compare the outcomes of a primary Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA), a primary RSA and an RSA performed for revision of a failed TSA in patients aged >70 years, to determine if there is clear evidence to support a primary RSA in those aged >70 years instead of a primary TSA METHOD: This is a retrospective study of the NZJR from 2000 to 2018. We included all primary TSAs, primary RTSAs, and those RTSAs that were performed for the revision of a failed TSA. We excluded those RTSAs that were performed for the revision of an RTSA or hemiarthroplasty. The primary outcome was the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) at 6 months and 5 years, with a secondary outcome being the subsequent revision rate. A total of 3449 primary TSAs, 4681 primary RTSAs, and 104 revision RTSAs were identified. The mean OSSs at 6 months for a primary TSA, a primary RTSA, and a revision RTSA were 39.5 ± 9.0, 35.5 ± 9.4, and 32.5 ± 9.7, respectively (P < .001, primary TSA vs. primary RSTA; P <.001, primary TSA vs. revision RTSA; P = .0252 primary RTSA vs. revision RTSA). The mean OSSs at 5 years for a primary TSA and a primary RTSA were 42.1 ± 7.5 vs. 39.8 ± 8.4, respectively (P < .001), with no results available for revision RTSA. The secondary outcome was the revision rate for those aged >70 years with osteoarthritis as their primary indication for surgery. The revision rates for a primary TSA and a primary RTSA were 0.53/100 component-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.72) and 0.51/100 component-years (95% CI 0.31-0.79), respectively (P = .193), which was not statistically significant. The TSA remains the gold standard for primary shoulder arthroplasty. For those individuals aged >70 years with osteoarthritis as their primary diagnosis, a primary TSA is associated with a higher OSS than and similar revision rates to a primary RTSA's. However, these patients must be counseled regarding the risk of subsequent cuff failure, as the outcomes from a revision RTSA are significantly inferior than those from a primary RTSA.},

To determine the rate-limiting steps in Se volatilization from selenate and selenite, time- and concentration-dependent kinetics of Se accumulation and volatilization were studied in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea). Time-dependent kinetic studies showed that selenate was taken up 2-fold faster than selenite. Selenate was rapidly translocated to the shoot, away from the root, the site of volatilization, whereas only approximately 10% of the selenite was translocated. For both selenate- and selenite-supplied plants, Se accumulation and volatilization increased linearly with external Se concentration up to 20 &mgr;M; volatilization rates were also linearly correlated with root Se concentrations. Se-volatilization rates were 2- to 3-fold higher from plants supplied with selenite compared with selenate. Se speciation by x-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that selenite-supplied plants accumulated organic Se, most likely selenomethionine, whereas selenate-supplied plants accumulated selenate. Our data suggest that Se volatilization from selenate is limited by the rate of selenate reduction, as well as by the availability of Se in roots, as influenced by uptake and translocation. Se volatilization from selenite may be limited by selenite uptake and by the conversion of selenomethionine to dimethylselenide.},

  abstract = {Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common comorbidity of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data on the determination of CKD-related biomarkers among patients with T2DM in a real-life setting within Germany are limited. We aimed to determine the prevalence of CKD and risk factors, availability of urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life among patients with T2DM in Germany. SMART-Finder is a retrospective and prospective, observational, digital, patient-centered cohort study being performed as part of the routine use of an adherence-supporting app. This baseline analysis' observation period was from August to November 2023. Patients with T2DM in Germany who actively used the MyTherapy app; allowed push notifications; and documented use of diabetes medications, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, finerenone, and/or blood glucose test strips were eligible for inclusion. Study materials (background information, electronic consent form, and laboratory and electronic questionnaires) were provided to eligible patients via app push notifications. Participants completed an electronic case report form that included questions on their blood pressure; their most recent UACR, eGFR, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values in the past 12 months; the EQ-5D-5L; and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with a UACR of ≥30 mg/g. Of 9527 invited eligible patients, 101 completed the electronic case report form (male: n=61; female: n=40; age: mean 54.2, SD 11.4 y). Of these, 1 female patient and 5 male patients reported their UACR values; 3 (all male) had a UACR of ≥30 mg/g. The remaining 95 patients reported that their health care professionals had not provided UACR measurements. Only 9 (8.9%) patients were aware of their latest eGFR values (3 patients: 15-44 mL/min/1.73 m2; 6 patients: 45-89 mL/min/1.73 m2), 90 provided HbA1c values (80 patients: ≥6.0%), 46 had a systolic blood pressure of ≥130 mm Hg, and 83 reported former or current nephrotoxic medication intake. The mean EQ-5D-5L index score was 0.7 (SD 0.3; range -0.1 to 1.0; 50 patients). The mean Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire score was 28.8 (SD 6.8; range 9.0-36.0; 49 patients). Patients with T2DM who were using an adherence-supporting app in Germany lacked awareness of CKD-related biomarkers but had high knowledge of self-manageable biomarkers (eg, blood pressure, serum fasting glucose, and HbA1c values). Our results suggest that treating physicians either do not test for UACRs and eGFRs or do not inform patients about the results. Nonadherence to diagnostic testing guidelines and a lack of physician-patient communication put patients at risk. Another reason for this health literacy imbalance may be the focus on HbA1c instead of kidney comorbidity in patient education material. Future goals for diabetes management must include guideline-compliant testing of CKD-related biomarkers and open physician-patient communication.},

Here, we designed and fabricated a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) for multi-user frequency selective beam steering (MU-FSBS) that achieves higher channel capacity than traditional time division multiple access (TDMA) techniques in multi-user communication scenarios. MU-FSBS is enabled by a varactor diode-tuned RIS that allows to steer several beams in the Ka-band independently at the same time. For such targeted multi-frequency beam steering, we implemented a customized neural network-based machine learning architecture specifically designed to optimize the bias voltage patterns of the RIS. As an experimental demonstration, we first accomplished independent beam steering of normally incident beams at 27 GHz and 31 GHz to deflection angles between 10[Formula: see text] and 45[Formula: see text] in a defined plane. Secondly, we compared the achievable channel capacities of the proposed MU-FSBS approach with those of TDMA, finding an average increase of approximately 50% in channel capacity at a fixed SNR of 20 dB. At an SNR of 60 dB, MU-FSBS even demonstrated a remarkable 84% increase in channel capacity compared to TDMA.},

In both imaging planes, differentiation of the deep and superficial layers of the medial collateral ligament was possible. Differentiation between the syndesmotic complex and the lateral collateral ligament was accomplished easily; in particular, differentiation of the posterior tibiofibular ligament from the posterior talofibular ligament was not difficult because of the differing insertions of these ligaments. The inhomogeneous appearance of the medial collateral ligament and the posterior talofibular ligament on MR images correlated with areas of fatty tissue on corresponding microscopic sections.

Individuals with SMC1A variants show a higher cognitive level and less SIB than individuals with NIPBL variants. Individuals with SMC1A variants without classic CdLS phenotype but with a Rett-like phenotype show more severe intellectual disability and more SIB compared to those with a CdLS phenotype. Autism is less present if outcomes in direct in-person assessments are evaluated taking developmental level into account compared to results based on a questionnaire.

MIA in rats models a number of the brain and behavioral changes that are observed in schizophrenia, including impaired memory. Recent studies in the MIA model have shown that the firing of the hippocampal place cells that are involved in memory processes appear relatively normal, but with abnormalities in the temporal ordering of firing. In this study, we re-analyzed data from prior hippocampal electrophysiological recordings of MIA and control animals to determine whether temporal dysfunction was evident. We find that there is a decreased ratio of slow to fast gamma power, resulting from an increase in fast gamma power and a tendency toward reduced slow gamma power in MIA rats. Moreover, we observe a robust reduction in spectral coherence between hippocampal theta and both fast and slow gamma rhythms, as well as changes in the phase of theta at which fast gamma occurs. We also find the phasic organization of place cell phase precession on the theta wave to be abnormal in MIA rats. Lastly, we observe that the local field potential of MIA rats contains more frequent sharp-wave ripple events, and that place cells were more likely to fire spikes during ripples in these animals than control. These findings provide further evidence of desynchrony in MIA animals and may point to circuit-level changes that underlie failures to integrate and encode information in schizophrenia.},

The SSC guideline was used as base for a national procedure. Almost all recommendations of the SSC were followed e.g. no adjustment of PRP, citrate concentration of 109 mM, 21 needle gauge, fasting, resting time for whole blood and PRP, centrifugation time, speed and agonists concentrations. LTA of healthy volunteers was measured in a total of 16 hospitals with 5 hospitals before and after standardization. Results of more than 120 healthy volunteers (maximum aggregation %) were collected, with participating laboratories using 4 different analyzers with different reagents. Use of low agonist concentrations showed high variation before and after standardization, with the exception of collagen. For most high agonist concentrations (ADP, collagen, ristocetin, epinephrine and arachidonic acid) variability in healthy subjects decreased after standardization. We can conclude that a standardized Dutch protocol for LTA, based on the SSC guideline, does not result in smaller variability in healthy volunteers for all agonist concentrations.},

We established a scalable process that embodies open innovation principles, to broaden and distribute the innovation locus. Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. We invited 8800+ nurses and other direct caregivers to participate in organisational problem solving. We solicited employees to (1) identify pain points and develop solutions and (2) crowd vote to indicate which ideas they want to see implemented. 177 employees submitted 225 ideas, and 928 cast a vote. The 40 participants who submitted top-voted ideas were invited to develop a detailed implementation plan; of those, 27 submitted one. Four ideas emerged as winners. Formulating a clear call for ideas, securing leadership buy-in and generating excitement about the process were essential to our efforts. Challenges associated with opening the innovation process involved managing a large volume of participants and submissions, and providing on-the-go training to nurses and staff who were not used to being asked to participate in organisational problem solving.},

  abstract = {Anovulation is a common cause of female subfertility. Treatment of anovulation is aimed at induction of ovulation. In women with clomiphene-citrate resistant WHO group II anovulation, one of the treatment options is ovulation induction with exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH or follitropin). FSH is derived from urine or is produced as recombinant FSH. Two forms of recombinant FSH are available - follitropin alpha and follitropin beta. To evaluate the efficacy, safety, costs and acceptability of recombinant FSH, we performed a review to compare recombinant FSH with urinary-derived FSH products. Follitropin alpha, beta and urinary FSH products appeared to be equally effective in terms of pregnancy rates. Patient safety was also found to be comparable, as the incidence of side effects including multiple pregnancies was similar for all FSH products. In practice follitropin alpha and beta may be more convenient to use due to the ease of self-administration, but they are also more expensive than the urinary products.},

Whereas 60% to 85% of these women will ovulate on CC, only about one half will have conceived after six cycles. If women do not conceive, treatment can be continued with gonadotropins or intra-uterine insemination (IUI). At present, it is unclear for how many cycles ovulation induction with CC should be repeated, and when to switch to ovulation induction with gonadotropins and/or IUI. We started a multicenter randomised controlled trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of CC plus intercourse or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus intercourse or six cycles of CC plus IUI or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus IUI.Women with WHO type II anovulation who ovulate but did not conceive after six ovulatory cycles of CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days will be included.Our primary outcome is birth of a healthy child resulting from a pregnancy that was established in the first eight months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and treatment costs. The analysis will be performed according to the intention to treat principle. Two comparisons will be made, one in which CC is compared to gonadotrophins and one in which the addition of IUI is compared to ovulation induction only. Assuming a live birth rate of 40% after CC, 55% after addition of IUI and 55% after ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, with an alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, we need to recruit 200 women per arm (800 women in total).An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee has criticized the data of the first 150 women and concluded that a sample size re-estimation should be performed after including 320 patients (i.e. 80 per arm). The trial will provide evidence on the most effective, safest and most cost effective treatment in women with WHO type II anovulation who do not conceive after six ovulatory cycles with CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days. This evidence could imply the need for changing our guidelines, which may cause a shift in large practice variation to evidence based primary treatment for these women.

Should these compounds be discovered in fish as they have in ragworm, rodents, and humans, they could present an indicative biomarker for assessing oil pollution. In this study, the ability to biotransform alkyl PAHs to PAAs was examined on Atlantic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). Exposure to phenanthrene, 1-methyphenanthrene or 1,4-dimethylphenanthrene was performed via intraperitoneal injection. An Ion Mobility Quadrupole Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (IMS-Q-TOF MS) was used in exploratory analysis of extracted bile samples. Acquisition of four-dimensional information by coupling liquid chromatography with the IMS-Q-TOF MS and in-silico prediction for feature prioritization in the data processing workflow allowed several tentative identifications with high degree of confidence. This work presents the first detection of PAAs in fish and suggests the importance of investigating alkyl PAHs in ecotoxicological studies of oil-polluted fish environments.},

Transformation processes of PAHs via degradation and biotransformation have parallels in humans, animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Mapping the transformation products of PAHs is therefore crucial for assessing their toxicological impact and developing effective monitoring strategies. The present research aimed to explore the PAH detoxification products formed by the marine fish Atlantic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) after single PAH treatments. Using target and suspect screening analyses on an ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (IM-QTOF MS), deprotonated compounds were identified and archived into a metabolite mass spectral library, which is systematized and presented in this work. The results offer an exclusive overview of the transformation products and their associated mass spectral features. Transformation products include hydroxy compounds, dihydrodiols, polycyclic aromatic acids, glucuronides, sulfates, glutathiones, cysteinylglycines, cysteines, and mercapturic acids. By documenting high-resolution mass spectrometry data, this comprehensive characterization provides a valuable reference point for the development of broad-spectrum analytical methods. It also addresses a critical gap in the field by presenting tentative identifications of PAH transformation products in the absence of analytical standards. Moreover, it encourages further investigation of these compounds as they have important toxicological relevance in both ecotoxicology and human research.},

The platform needed to be relatively affordable, rapid to deploy, and use a common and accessible technology. Central to this project, we wanted to make the content of the platform open to any investigator without restriction. In designing this array we prioritized a number of types of genetic variability for inclusion, such as known risk alleles, disease-causing mutations, putative risk alleles, and other functionally important variants. The array was primarily designed to allow rapid screening of samples for disease-causing mutations and large population studies of risk factors. Notably, an explicit aim was to make this array widely available to facilitate data sharing across and within diseases. The resulting array, NeuroX, is a remarkably cost and time effective solution for high-quality genotyping. NeuroX comprises a backbone of standard Illumina exome content of approximately 240,000 variants, and over 24,000 custom content variants focusing on neurologic diseases. Data are generated at approximately $50-$60 per sample using a 12-sample format chip and regular Infinium infrastructure; thus, genotyping is rapid and accessible to many investigators. Here, we describe the design of NeuroX, discuss the utility of NeuroX in the analyses of rare and common risk variants, and present quality control metrics and a brief primer for the analysis of NeuroX derived data.},

Insecticide mode of action (MoA), target species, and sex are variables that could affect insecticide-induced mortality. We recorded the mortality caused by three neurotoxic insecticides with different modes of action (chlorpyrifos [organophosphate, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor], λ-cyhalothrin [pyrethroid, sodium channel modulator], and thiacloprid [neonicotinoid, nicotinic acetylcholinesterase receptor agonist]) applied topically to adult males and females of three economically important tortricid species [Cydia pomonella (L.), Grapholita molesta (Busck), and Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller)] that strongly depend on insecticide use for their control. Concentration and dose-mortality curves were recorded at 24 and 48 h postapplication. Large mortality differences between insecticides (maximum 7,800-fold for LD50) were followed by much lower, yet important, differences between species (maximum 115-fold), and sexes (maximum 41.5-fold). Significant interactions between the three factors indicate that they are not independent from each other. Interestingly, with the organophosphate chlorpyrifos, males of the three species were less susceptible than females, which was unexpected, as females are larger than males. Higher female sensitivity to organophosphates has been reported previously but only in G. molesta, not in other moth species. Our results highlight the importance of taking into account sex in dose-mortality studies with adult moths.},

Insect mortality arising from the insecticides, with the application of enzyme inhibitors - S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF), diethyl maleate (DEM), and piperonyl butoxide (PBO) - was first determined. The inhibitors' influence on EST, GST, and PSMO activity was quantified. EST and PSMO (the phase-I enzymatic activities) were involved in the insecticide detoxification in the three species for both sexes, highlighting the role of EST, whereas GST (phase-II enzymes) was involved only in G. molesta insecticide detoxification. L. botrana exhibited, in general, the highest level of enzymatic activity, with a significantly higher EST activity compared with the other species. It was the only species with differences in the response between sexes, with higher GST and PSMO activity in females than in males, which can be explained as the lower susceptibility of the females to the tested insecticides. A positive correlation between PSMO activity and the thiacloprid LD50s in the different species-sex groups was observed explaining the species-specific differences in susceptibility to the product reported in a previous study.},

The possible influence of the selected factors was also examined in a regression analysis in a model with case growth rates. The small-scale local infection process changed during the pandemic. Neighborhoods with weaker socio-economic indices showed higher incidence over a large part of the pandemic course, with a positive correlation between poverty risk factors and age-standardized incidence. The strength of this correlation changed over time. The timely observation and analysis of the local spread dynamics reveals the positive correlation of disadvantaging socio-economic factors on the incidence rate of COVID-19 at the level of a large city and can help steer local containment measures in a targeted manner.},

As in many areas of daily life, digitalization is becoming increasingly important in the medical field amid the exponential rise in the use of computers and smartphones. This opens up new possibilities for optimizing patient education in the context of anesthesia. The main aim of this study was to assess the implementation of remote consent in Europe. An online survey entitled "Digital online Patient Informed Consent for Anesthesia before Elective Surgery. Recent practice in Europe," with a total of 27 questions, was sent by the European Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) to their members in 47 European countries. To assess the effect of the economy on digitalization and legal status with regard to anesthesia consent, data were stratified based on gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC). In total, 23.1% and 37.2% of the 930 participants indicated that it was possible to obtain consent online or via telephone, respectively. This observation was more often reported in countries with high GDPPC levels than in countries with low GDPPC levels. Furthermore, 27.3% of the responses for simple anesthesia, 18.7% of the responses for complex anesthesia, and 32.2% of the responses for repeated anesthesia indicated that remote consent was in accordance with the law, and this was especially prevalent in countries with high GDPPC. Concerning the timing of consent, patients were informed at least one day before in 67.1% of cases for simple procedures and in 85.2% of cases for complex procedures. Even European countries with high GDPPC use remote informed consent only in a minority of cases, and most of the time for repeated anesthetic procedures. This might reflect the inconsistent legal situation and inhomogeneous medical technical structures across Europe.},

To overcome the lack of suitable in vitro models that faithfully recapitulate the intricate three-dimensional architecture, complex cellular interactions, and fluid dynamics within the SAS, we have developed a perfusion bioreactor-based 3D in vitro model using primary human meningothelial cells (MECs) to generate meningeal tissue constructs. We ultimately employed this model to evaluate the impact of impaired CSF flow as evidenced during optic nerve compartment syndrome on the transcriptomic landscape of MECs. Primary human meningothelial cells (phMECs) were seeded and cultured on collagen scaffolds in a perfusion bioreactor to generate engineered meningeal tissue constructs. Engineered constructs were compared to human SAS and assessed for specific cell-cell interaction markers as well as for extracellular matrix proteins found in human meninges. Using the established model, meningeal tissue constructs were exposed to physiological and pathophysiological flow conditions simulating the impaired CSF flow associated with optic nerve compartment syndrome and RNA sequencing was performed. Engineered constructs displayed similar microarchitecture compared to human SAS with regards to pore size, geometry as well as interconnectivity. They stained positively for specific cell-cell interaction markers indicative of a functional meningeal tissue, as well as extracellular matrix proteins found in human meninges. Analysis by RNA sequencing revealed altered expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, endo-lysosomal processing, and mitochondrial energy metabolism under pathophysiological flow conditions. Alterations of these biological processes may not only interfere with critical MEC functions impacting CSF and hence optic nerve homeostasis, but may likely alter SAS structure, thereby further impeding cerebrospinal fluid flow. Future studies based on the established 3D model will lead to new insights into the role of MECs in the pathogenesis of optic nerve but also brain degenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Lipidation of transmembrane proteins regulates many cellular activities, including signal transduction, cell-cell communication, and membrane trafficking. However, how lipidation at different sites in a membrane protein affects structure and function remains elusive. Here, using native mass spectrometry we determined that wild-type human tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 exhibit nonstochastic distributions of bound acyl chains. We revealed CD9 lipidation at its three most frequent lipidated sites suffices for EWI-F binding, while cysteine-to-alanine CD9 mutations markedly reduced binding of EWI-F. EWI-F binding by CD9 was rescued by mutating all or, albeit to a lesser extent, only the three most frequently lipidated sites into tryptophans. These mutations did not affect the nanoscale distribution of CD9 in cell membranes, as shown by super-resolution microscopy using a CD9-specific nanobody. Thus, these data demonstrate site-specific, possibly conformation-dependent, functionality of lipidation in tetraspanin CD9 and identify tryptophan mimicry as a possible biochemical approach to study site-specific transmembrane-protein lipidation.},

This work assesses the epidemiology, diagnosis, hemodynamic and functional parameters, and treatment of CTEPH in Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia. A prospective, cohort, phase IV, observational registry with 3-year follow-up (n = 212) in patients aged ≥ 18 years diagnosed with CTEPH was created. Clinical, hemodynamic, and functional parameters were obtained at an initial visit, follow-up visits, and a final visit at the end of 3 years' observation or end of follow-up. Data were recorded on electronic case report forms. Parameters evaluated included 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), use of pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA), pulmonary hypertension (PH)-targeted therapy, and survival. All statistical analyses were exploratory and descriptive, and were performed in the overall population. The most common symptoms were typical of those expected for CTEPH. Almost 90% of patients underwent right heart catheterization at diagnosis or initial study visit. In total, 66 patients (31%) underwent PEA before the initial visit; 95 patients (45%) were considered operable, 115 (54%) were inoperable, and two (1%) had no operability data. Only 26 patients (12%) had been assessed for BPA at their initial visit. PH-targeted therapy was documented at diagnosis for 77 patients (36%), most commonly a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (23%). Use of PH-targeted therapy increased to 142 patients (67%) at the initial visit, remaining similar after 3 years. Use of riociguat increased from 6% of patients at diagnosis to 38% at 3 years. Between baseline and end of observation, results for patients with paired data showed an increase in 6MWD. Survival at the end of observation was 88%. These data highlight the current diagnosis and management of CTEPH in the participating countries. They show that early CTEPH diagnosis remains challenging, and use of off-label PH-targeted therapy is common. gov: NCT02637050; registered December 2015.},

The PoC system, namely PATHPOD, consisting of a standalone device (weight less than 1.2 kg) and a cartridge, can perform the detection of 10 different samples and two controls in less than 50 min, which is much more rapid than the golden standard real-time reverse-transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), typically taking 16-48 h. The novel total internal reflection (TIR) scheme and the reactions inside the cartridge in the PoC device allow monitoring of the diagnostic results in real-time and onsite. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the PoC test are comparable with the current RT-PCR, with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 30-50 viral genome copies. The robustness of the PATHPOD PoC system has been confirmed by analyzing 398 clinical samples initially examined in two hospitals in Denmark. The clinical sensitivity and specificity of these tests are discussed.},

General linear mixed models were fitted to the dependent variable cortical thickness. Cognitive assessment comprised the Stroop Test and Trail Making Test B. In the linear mixed model, presence of carotid stenosis had no effect on cortical thickness. There was a significant interaction of stenosis and region with a trend towards lower cortical thickness in the MCA region on the side of carotid stenosis. Patients with carotid stenosis performed significantly worse on the Stroop test than controls, but there was no correlation with cortical thickness. In patients with carotid stenosis without ischemic brain lesions, neither a clear pattern of reduced cortical thickness nor an association of cortical thickness with cognitive function was observed. Our data do not support the hypothesized association of cortical thinning and cognitive impairment in carotid stenosis.},

  abstract = {Phasmatodea are well known for their ability to disguise themselves by mimicking twigs, leaves, or bark, and are therefore commonly referred to as stick and leaf insects. In addition to this and other defensive strategies, many phasmatodean species use paired prothoracic repellent glands to release defensive chemicals when disturbed by predators or parasites. These glands are considered as an autapomorphic trait of the Phasmatodea. However, detailed knowledge of the gland anatomy and chemical compounds is scarce and only a few species were studied until now. We investigated the repellent glands for a global sampling of stick and leaf insects that represents all major phasmatodean lineages morphologically via µCT scans and analyzed the anatomical traits in a phylogenetic context. All twelve investigated species possess prothoracic repellent glands that we classify into four distinct gland types. 1: lobe-like glands, 2: sac-like glands without ejaculatory duct, 3: sac-like glands with ejaculatory duct and 4: tube-like glands. Lobe-like glands are exclusively present in Timema, sac-like glands without ejaculatory duct are only found in Orthomeria, whereas the other two types are distributed across all other taxa (= Neophasmatodea). The relative size differences of these glands vary significantly between species, with some glands not exceeding in length the anterior quarter of the prothorax, and other glands extending to the end of the metathorax. We could not detect any strong correlation between aposematic or cryptic coloration of the examined phasmatodeans and gland type or size. We hypothesize that a comparatively small gland was present in the last common ancestor of Phasmatodea and Euphasmatodea, and that the gland volume increased independently in subordinate lineages of the Occidophasmata and Oriophasmata. Alternatively, the stem species of Neophasmatodea already developed large glands that were reduced in size several times independently. In any case, our results indicate a convergent evolution of the gland types, which was probably closely linked to properties of the chemical components and different predator selection pressures. Our study is the first showing the great anatomical variability of repellent glands in stick and leaf insects.},

The deaths occurred in two separate outbreaks and were associated with losses from malignant catarrhal fever in other ruminants in the exhibit. The most prominent clinical sign was severe dyspnea, and death occurred within five days. The principal lesions were an acute nonsuppurative inflammation of the respiratory tract and pulmonary vessels, lymphadenopathy and lymphoid cell infiltration in the organs of some animals.

The Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain mediated interaction between cSrc kinase and ER plays a key role in this; however the molecular determinants of this interaction have not been elucidated. Here, we used phosphorylated ER peptide and semisynthetic protein constructs in a combined biochemical and structural study to, for the first time, provide a quantitative and structural characterization of the cSrc SH2-ER interaction. Fluorescence polarization experiments delineated the SH2 binding motif in the ER sequence. Chemical shift perturbation analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allowed us to put forward a 3D model of the ER-SH2 interaction. The structural basis of this protein-protein interaction has been compared with that of the high affinity SH2 binding sequence GpYEEI. The ER features a different binding mode from that of the "two-pronged plug two-hole socket" model in the so-called specificity determining region. This alternative binding mode is modulated via the folding of ER helix 12, a structural element directly C-terminal of the key phosphorylated tyrosine. The present findings provide novel molecular entries for understanding nongenomic ER signaling and targeting the corresponding disease states.},

Of this group, 17 patients had a high (or intermediate) ARM, 28 a low ARM, and 4 a cloacal malformation (CM). The evaluation of the imaging studies included the level and type of ARM (preop); the developmental state of the sphincter muscle complex (SMC); and the associated anomalies of spinal cord, spine, and urogenital system. The anomalies detected were ordered and related to recent embryologic observations in the caudal region. With MRI, the level of ARM was depicted effectively in 23 of 24 patients (96%) investigated preop, including 5 of 9 clinically proven fistulae in those with high ARM and CM (56%). Maldevelopment of the SMC was observed in 14 of 49 patients (29%). Associated anomalies of spinal cord and spine were found in 51% of patients, more frequently in those with high ARM, low ARM with fistulae, and cloacal malformations. Associated anomalies of the urogenital system were found in 37% of patients. As illustrated by the current study, MRI has become indispensable for the visualization of the nature of congenital ARM and associated anomalies. Moreover, MRI aids in understanding the morphology and pathogenesis of these complex congenital malformations. Based on the MRI and recent embryologic observations, a new and simplified classification of ARM is introduced, including a more appropriate nomenclature.},

  abstract = {In the literature, some controversy still exists about the normal and abnormal development of the human anorectum. Therefore, a three-dimensional and histological study was performed on human embryos. In early anorectal development (< or = 49 days postfertilization), the cloaca plays a crucial role, separated from the amniotic cavity by its cloacal membrane. In the cloaca, the yolk sac/primitive hindgut and allantois/primitive urogenital sinus enter. During the embryonic caudal folding process, incorporation of these structures occurs, including their surrounding extraembryonic mesoderm, which fuses to form the urorectal septum. Consequently, this septum does not grow in the direction of the cloacal membrane, and fusion of these structures is likewise never observed. The cloaca remains as such until the cloacal membrane ruptures by apoptotic cell death. The dorsal part of the cloaca then becomes part of the amniotic cavity, and is by no means involved in the development of the anorectum. The tip of the urorectal septum will become the perineal area. Soon after rupture of the cloacal membrane, during late anorectal development (> or = 49 days postfertilization), a secondary occlusion of the anorectal canal occurs, first due to adhesion, followed by formation of an epithelial "plug" at the level of the anal orifice. Recanalization, by apoptotic cell death, of this secondary occluded anal orifice occurs later during development. Based on these embryological observations, congenital anorectal malformations with an abnormal communication to the exterior are best explained as early embryonic defects. The abnormal communications, usually called fistulae, should be regarded as ectopic anal orifices. Anorectal malformations with the anus in normal position are best explained as late embryonic defects.},

  abstract = {To compare cardiac-triggered dual-echo spin-echo and magnetization transfer-prepared gradient-echo (MT-GE) MR imaging in the detection of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions in the spinal cord. The cervical spinal cord in 20 patients with MS and in nine healthy volunteers was examined with spin-echo and MT-GE MR imaging. Sagittal images were scored for number of lesions, certainty about lesions, image quality, and visual hindrance by artifacts in random order by two radiologists separately and in a blinded manner. In one healthy volunteer, a lesion was seen on images obtained with both images. Lesion/cord contrast-to-noise ratio was equal on both the MT-GE and T2-weighted spin-echo images. MT-GE images showed better image quality and fewer artifacts than the spin-echo images did. The readers found approximately the same number of lesions. However, the number of definite lesions was higher for the spin-echo sequence than for the MT-GE sequence. One reader found 45 definite lesions with spin-echo and 34 definite lesions with MT-GE. For the other reader, these numbers were 37 (spin-echo) and 31 (MT-GE). On the spin-echo images, 90% of the patients were considered to have definite lesions; on the MT-GE images, the readers found definite lesions in 65% (reader 1) and in 70% (reader 2) of the patients. Image quality was better with the MT-GE technique than with the spin-echo technique, and lesion/cord contrast-to-noise ratio on the MT-GE images was equal to that of T2-weighted spin-echo images. However, for detecting spinal cord MS lesions in the sagittal plane, the spin-echo images were preferred to the MT-GE images.},

The spinal cords of 20 healthy control subjects and 60 patients with MS (22 with relapsing-remitting disease, 22 with secondary-progressive disease, and 16 with primary-progressive disease) were examined with sagittal dual-echo spin-echo MR imaging and with axial T2*-weighted gradient-echo MR imaging. Two interpreters scored the images for focal lesions and for diffuse abnormalities. Cross-sectional areas of the cords were measured at the C-2 level. No abnormalities were found in any of the control subjects nor in two of the patients. Fifty (83%) of 60 patients had focal lesions. Diffuse abnormality and focal lesions were found in 50% of patients with secondary-progressive MS, in 25% of patients with primary-progressive disease, and in 18% of patients with relapsing-remitting disease. Diffuse abnormality without focal lesions was found in seven patients with primary-progressive MS and in one patient with secondary-progressive MS. Patients with diffuse abnormalities had a smaller cross-sectional area of the spinal cord and they suffered from more disability than did patients without diffuse abnormalities. The MR appearance of the spinal cord differs among clinical subgroups of MS. Diffuse abnormality of the spinal cord is associated with a progressive clinical course and greater disability.},

  abstract = {Homogeneity and longitudinal coverage of transmit (Tx) human head RF coils at ultrahigh field (UHF, ≥7 T) can be improved by 3D RF shimming, which requires using multi-row Tx arrays. Examples of 3D RF shimming using double-row UHF loop transceiver (TxRx) and Tx arrays have been described previously. Dipole antennas provide unique simplicity and robustness while offering comparable Tx efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio to conventional loop designs. Single-row Tx and TxRx human head UHF dipole arrays have been previously described by multiple groups. Recently, we developed a novel type of dipole antenna, a folded-end dipole, and presented single-row eight-element array prototypes for human head imaging at 7 and 9.4 T. These studies have shown that the novel antenna design can improve the longitudinal coverage and minimize peak local specific absorption rate (SAR) as compared with common unfolded dipoles. In this work, we developed, constructed, and evaluated a 16-element double-row TxRx folded-end dipole array for human head imaging at 9.4 T. To minimize cross-talk between neighboring dipoles located in different rows, we used transformer decoupling, which decreased coupling to a level below -20 dB. The developed array design was demonstrated to be capable of 3D static RF shimming and can be potentially used for dynamic shimming using parallel transmission. For optimal phase shifts between the rows, the array provides 11% higher SAR efficiency and 18% higher homogeneity than a folded-end dipole single-row array of the same length. The design also offers a substantially simpler and more robust alternative to the common double-row loop array with about 10% higher SAR efficiency and better longitudinal coverage.},

This shortens cardiac repolarization and QT intervals, predisposing patients to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of KCNH2-specific suppression-and-replacement (KCNH2-SupRep) gene therapy in a transgenic rabbit model of SQT1. KCNH2-SupRep was developed by combining a KCNH2-shRNA with its corresponding shRNA-immune KCNH2-cDNA into an AAV9 vector, delivered directly into the aortic root (1x1010 vg/kg). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in vivo by electrocardiogram, ex vivo by optical mapping, and at cellular levels by patch-clamp, calcium imaging, and qPCR in ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCMs). In vivo, KCNH2-SupRep normalized the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) in SQT1 rabbits, without affecting repolarization heterogeneity. Ex vivo, KCNH2-SupRep corrected the action potential duration (APD90) and resolved the increased apicobasal APD90 heterogeneity observed in untreated (UT)-SQT1 hearts, supporting an antiarrhythmic effect, which was further validated by reduced re-entry formation in silico. At cellular levels, KCNH2-SupRep prolonged APD90 in VCMs from SupRep-SQT1 rabbits closer to wildtype levels compared to UT- and sham-SQT1. Additionally, KCNH2-SupRep restored the cellular surrogate of the electro-mechanical window and normalized IKr in nearly 50% of VCMs, in line with a 50-60% suppression of the mutant KCNH2 transcript. This proof-of-concept study is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of gene therapy for SQT1 in a medium-sized animal model. KCNH2-SupRep gene therapy successfully corrected the pathologic phenotype in vivo, ex vivo and at cellular levels in transgenic SQT1 rabbits.},

The two groups self-assessed their knowledge and skills as adequate. However, the control group (N=111) had significantly more difficulty in delivering chest compressions deeper than 4 cm (25 versus 1 candidate in the CPREzy group), P=0.0001. The control group compressed ineffectively in 36% (+/-41%) of all compressions as opposed to 6+/-13% in the CPREzy group (N=112, P=0.0001). If compressions were effective initially, the time until >50% of compressions were less than 4 cm deep was 75+/-81s in the control group versus 194+/-87 s in the CPREzy group (P=0.0001 [-180 to -57.5]). After a few seconds of training in its use, our candidates used the CPREzy effectively. Against the background knowledge that estimation of compression depth by the rescuer or other team members is difficult, and that performing effective compressions is the cornerstone of any resuscitation attempt, our data suggests that a feedback device such as the CPREzy should be used consistently during resuscitation.},

Sixty CPR sessions (140s each, 30:2, C:R ratio 1:1) were performed using a manikin on standard hospital mattresses, with or without a backboard in combination with variable weights. Sternum-to-spine compression distance was controlled (range 30-60mm) allowing evaluation of the underlying compliant surface on total hand travel. Movement of the caregiver's hands was significantly larger (up to 111mm at 50mm compression depth, p<0.0001) when sternum-to-spine compressions were performed without a backboard than with one. The extent of this variable extra travel effect depended on the type of mattress as well as the force of compression. Foam mattresses and air chamber systems act as springs and follow hand movement, while 'slow foam' mattresses incorporate time delays, making depth and force sensing harder. A backboard decreases the extra hand movement due to mattress effects by more than 50%, strongly reducing caregiver work. Total vertical hand movement is significantly, and clinically relevantly much, larger than sternum-to-spine compression depth when CPR is performed on a mattress. Additional movement depends on the type of mattress and can be strongly reduced, but not eliminated, when a backboard is applied. The additional motion and increased work load adds extra complexity to in-hospital CPR. We propose that this should be taken into account during training by in-hospital caregivers.},

To extend previous findings of striatal hypersensitivity with behavioral observations and with cellular activity in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex in sensitized animals. Rats treated acutely with 0, 1, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg i.p. amphetamine and sensitized rats challenged with 1 mg/kg i.p. amphetamine were scored for stereotypy, rearing, and grooming, and locomotor activity recorded. c-fos positive nuclei were quantified in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex after expression of sensitization with 1 mg/kg i.p. amphetamine. Intense stereotypy was seen in animals treated acutely with 5 mg/kg amphetamine, but not in the sensitized group treated with 1 mg/kg amphetamine. The c-fos response to amphetamine in the accumbens core was augmented in amphetamine-pretreated animals with a shift in the distribution of optical density, while no effect of sensitization was seen in the nucleus accumbens shell or prefrontal cortex. A lack of stereotypy in the sensitized group indicates a dissociation of behavioral responses to amphetamine and striatal immediate-early gene activation patterns. The increase in c-fos positive nuclei and shift in the distribution of optical density observed in the nucleus accumbens core suggests recruitment of a new population of neurons during expression of sensitization.},

The primary absorber is melanin. Photochemical damage occurs at body temperature and involves cellular damage by reactive forms of oxygen. The photosensitizers are photoproducts of the visual pigments. First indications that non-thermal damage might exist, in particular in the case of eclipse blindness, was presented by Vos in 1962. Attribution thereof to photochemical action was presented in 1966 by Noell et al who also measured the first action spectrum, in rat. It turned out to be identical to the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin. However, in 1976 and 1982 Ham et al found a quite different spectrum in monkeys, peaking at short wavelengths. The latter spectrum, but not the former, was confirmed since in numerous publications with animal models including rat. In ophthalmological practice a 'sunburn' was at first the only complaint caused by light damage. To avoid this, patients with dilated pupils should always be advised to wear sunglasses. Since the invention of the laser accidents have been reported, the most recent development is youth playfully pointing a strong laser pen in their eyes with marked consequences. The operation microscope and endoilluminators should always be used as brief as possible to avoid photochemical damage. Arguments for implant lenses that block not only the UV but also part of the visible spectrum seem too weak to justify extra costs.},

This study investigated whether domestic fowls perceive this discontinuity as flicker by training two Leghorn hens to choose between a continuous and a discontinuous light, all other variables being identical. 3. The light-stimulus was either monochromatic with 100% sinusoidal modulation or a fluorescent lamp whose modulation frequency could be electrically adjusted. 4. Each (correct) choice for the discontinuous light was followed by a 5 Hz higher frequency, whereas an incorrect choice was followed by a 10 Hz lower frequency. 5. On the basis of this principle the animals themselves established the highest perceivable frequency of the discontinuous light, called the Critical Fusion Frequency (CFF), that they could discriminate from continuous light. 6. These frequencies typically depend on the stimulus intensity increasing with increasing intensities, until a maximum value is reached. 7. Two factors limited the magnitudes of the CFF's that were recorded: the maximum stimulus intensities produced and variability in the chicken's response ("behavioural noise"). In spite of these constraints 105 Hz was established as the maximum CFF. 8. On the basis of extrapolation it is concluded that the direct light from fluorescent lamps driven by 50 Hz alternating current is seen by the chicken as flickering. 9. The results justify large-scale comparison of behaviour and production in poultry houses that are illuminated either by low-frequency or by high-frequency fluorescent lamps.},

  abstract = {Recognition of histone modifications by specialized protein domains is a key step in the regulation of DNA-mediated processes like gene transcription. The structural basis of these interactions is usually studied using histone peptide models, neglecting the nucleosomal context. Here, we provide the structural and thermodynamic basis for the recognition of H3K36-methylated (H3K36me) nucleosomes by the PSIP1-PWWP domain, based on extensive mutational analysis, advanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and computational approaches. The PSIP1-PWWP domain binds H3K36me3 peptide and DNA with low affinity, through distinct, adjacent binding surfaces. PWWP binding to H3K36me nucleosomes is enhanced approximately 10,000-fold compared to a methylated peptide. Based on mutational analyses and NMR data, we derive a structure of the complex showing that the PWWP domain is bound to H3K36me nucleosomes through simultaneous interactions with both methylated histone tail and nucleosomal DNA. Concerted binding to the methylated histone tail and nucleosomal DNA underlies the high- affinity, specific recognition of H3K36me nucleosomes by the PSIP1-PWWP domain. We propose that this bipartite binding mechanism is a distinctive and general property in the recognition of histone modifications close to the nucleosome core.},

  abstract = {(1) Background: The aim of this study was examining the ex vivo and in vivo properties of a composite made from polycaprolactone (PCL) and biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP) (synprint, ScientiFY GmbH) fabricated via fused deposition modelling (FDM); (2) Methods: Scaffolds were tested ex vivo for their mechanical properties using porous and solid designs. Subcutaneous implantation model analyzed the biocompatibility of PCL + BCP and PCL scaffolds. Calvaria implantation model analyzed the osteoconductive properties of PCL and PCL + BCP scaffolds compared to BCP as control group. Established histological, histopathological and histomorphometrical methods were performed to evaluate new bone formation.; (3) Results Mechanical testing demonstrated no significant differences between PCL and PCL + BCP for both designs. Similar biocompatibility was observed subcutaneously for PCL and PCL + BCP scaffolds. In the calvaria model, new bone formation was observed for all groups with largest new bone formation in the BCP group, followed by the PCL + BCP group, and the PCL group. This finding was influenced by the initial volume of biomaterial implanted and remaining volume after 90 days. All materials showed osteoconductive properties and PCL + BCP tailored the tissue responses towards higher cellular biodegradability. Moreover, this material combination led to a reduced swelling in PCL + BCP; (4) Conclusions: Altogether, the results show that the newly developed composite is biocompatible and leads to successful osteoconductive bone regeneration. The new biomaterial combines the structural stability provided by PCL with bioactive characteristics of BCP-based BSM. 3D-printed BSM provides an integration behavior in accordance with the concept of guided bone regeneration (GBR) by directing new bone growth for proper function and restoration.},

  abstract = {We review recent work on applications of non-pharmacologic strategies to promote cognitive health in older adulthood and discuss potential network mechanisms, limitations, and considerations for improving intervention uptake and efficacy. In healthy older adults and patients with mild cognitive impairment, cognitive training produces global and domain-specific cognitive gains, though effect sizes tend to be modest and transfer is variable. Non-invasive brain stimulation has shown moderate success in enhancing cognitive function, though the optimum approach, parameters, and cortical targets require further investigation. Physical activity improves cognitive functions in late life, with emerging trials highlighting key intervention components that may maximize treatment outcomes. Multimodal interventions may be superior to single-component interventions in conferring cognitive gains, although interpretation is limited by modest sample sizes and variability in training components and parameters. Across modalities, individual differences in patient characteristics predict therapeutic response. These interventions may advance cognitive health by modulating functional networks that support core cognitive abilities including the default mode, executive control, and salience networks. Effectiveness of cognitive enhancement strategies may be increased with clinician-led coaching, booster sessions, gamification, integration of multiple intervention modalities, and concrete applications to everyday functioning. Future trials involving rigorous comparisons of training components, parameters, and delivery formats will be essential in establishing the precise approaches needed to maximize cognitive outcomes. Novel studies using patient-level clinical and neuroimaging features to predict individual differences in training gains may inform the development of personalized intervention prescriptions to optimize cognitive health in late life.},

  abstract = {Current incidence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 in Germany rely to a large extent on case notifications. However, the large number of mild or asymptomatic infections is likely to result in underestimation. Population-based studies can provide valid estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 incidence and thus support health authorities to monitor the epidemiological situation and to initiate, maintain, strengthen or relax effective countermeasures. This study was conducted in Cologne, Germany. Six-thousand randomly drawn Cologne residents, 18 years of age or older, were contacted by mail in March 2021. Study envelopes contained a kit for self-administered saliva sample and access details to a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, previous positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR and completed COVID-19 vaccinations. Participants were again invited for a second round in June 2021, while those who declined participation were replaced by additional randomly drawn Cologne residents in order to reach a total of 6000 potential participants again. The saliva samples were sent to the laboratory by mail and tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-qPCR. The incidence estimates were adjusted for sensitivity and specificity of the test procedure and compared with the official numbers of new SARS-CoV-2 cases in the adult Cologne population. The first surveillance round in March 2021 (response rate: 34.08%, N = 2045) showed a SARS-CoV-2 seven-day incidence of 85 cases per 100,000 adult Cologne residents (95% CI: 9 to 319). In the same period, the officially registered cases were 125 per 100,000. The second surveillance round in June 2021 (response rate: 36.53%, N = 2192) showed a seven-day incidence of 27 per 100,000 adult Cologne residents (95% CI: 1 to 142), while the official figures for newly registered SARS-CoV-2 cases in the same period were 15 per 100,000. The incidence estimates do not indicate relevant underestimation of new SARS-CoV-2 infections based on case notification. Regular use of the surveillance method developed here may nevertheless complement the efforts of the health authorities to assess the epidemiological situation.

To accomplish this, coronal, flat-panel-based volumetric computed tomography (eXplore Locus Ultra scanner) images were automatically analyzed by a software implementation of an algorithm that determines user independent whether a suture is open or closed. 29,205 images of the local vicinity of the sagittal suture of 164 males and 85 females of European descent were investigated separately for both sexes. We used conditional probabilities and a chi(2)-test to investigate whether there is a correlation between aad and suture obliteration or not. The computer-aided analysis enables us to handle huge volumes of data that could not otherwise be analyzed within a reasonable time frame. The implemented algorithm ensured a strongly reproducible, reliable, accurate, and fast differentiation between closed and open sutures. The evaluation of various statistical parameters suggests that there is no reason to assume a correlation between age and suture closure--with equal findings for both sexes. Therefore, we conclude that determination of aad based on the evaluation of sagittal suture obliteration is not possible. This agrees well - thus unsatisfactorily - with the recent literature.},

Foreign body intestinal perforation including that caused by fish bones has previously been reported in the literature and if clinically unrecognized, can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Fish bone perforation as a cause of chronic abdominal pain after LRYGP has rarely been reported. The unusual case of a 54year old female presenting with recurrent episodes of postprandial pain 2 years after LRYGP is reported. Previous radiological and endoscopic investigations did not reveal any abnormality and after the most recent clinical presentation, a laparoscopic exploration was performed. A protruding fish bone at the biliary-digestive junction was discovered intra-operatively and successfully extracted. Dense adhesions between the involved intestinal loops were lysed in an attempt to improve intestinal transit and subsequently relieve post-prandial pain. This case highlights the possibility of a missed fish bone perforation causing chronic postprandial abdominal pain and discomfort in a patient with a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass anatomy. Foreign body perforation is a rare cause of abdominal pain after gastric bypass that should be considered when evaluating chronic abdominal pain symptoms after LRYGP.},

Intrathecal IgM synthesis is associated with higher MS disease activity and severity, and IgM is the strongest complement-activating immunoglobulin. In this study, we investigated whether complement components (CCs) and complement activation products (CAPs) are increased in persons with MS, especially in those with an intrathecal IgM synthesis, and whether they are associated with disease severity and progression. CC and CAP levels were quantified in plasma and CSF of 112 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 127 patients with MS (90 relapsing-remitting, 14 primary progressive, and 23 secondary progressive), 31 inflammatory neurologic disease, and 44 symptomatic controls from the Basel CSF databank study. Patients with CIS/MS were followed in the Swiss MS cohort study (median 6.3 years). Levels of CC/CAP between diagnosis groups were compared; in CIS/MS, associations of CC/CAP levels with intrathecal Ig synthesis, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, MS Severity Score (MSSS), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were investigated by linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, and albumin quotient. CSF (but not plasma) levels of C3a, C4a, Ba, and Bb were increased in patients with CIS/MS, being most pronounced in those with an additional intrathecal IgM production. In CIS, doubling of C3a and C4a in CSF was associated with 0.31 (CI 0.06-0.56;  CNS-compartmentalized activation of the classical and alternative pathways of complement is increased in CIS/MS and associated with the presence of an intrathecal IgM production. Increased complement activation within the CSF correlates with EDSS, future MSSS, and NfL levels, supporting the concept that complement activation contributes to MS pathology and disease progression. Complement inhibition should be explored as therapeutic target to attenuate disease severity and progression in MS.},

PLT characteristics [PLT numbers, mean PLT volume (MPV), PLT distribution width (PDW), PLT large cell ratio (p-LCR), immature PLT fraction] and activation status [CD62p expression, platelet factor 4 (PF4) and beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) plasma levels] were estimated in 19 patients before and during HD. Blood was sampled from both the afferent and efferent lines. Additionally, the influence of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on PF4 and BTG concentrations was analyzed. CD62p expression increased in the extracorporeal circuit (ECC) in the first 30 min. Simultaneously, PLT numbers dropped markedly within the ECC. MPV, PDW and p-LCR decreased over time. Like CD62p expression, BTG reached peak values at t30, was exclusively released within the ECC and was not influenced by the application of LMWH. In contrast, PF4 was significantly released outside the ECC in response to LMWH. PLTs are predominantly activated within the ECC and not on a remote distance. PLTs stick to the ECC, particularly after first passage. BTG is an appropriate marker for HD-induced PLT degranulation, whereas PF4 originates from both activated PLTs and LMWH-induced detachment from the endothelium. PLTs are not exhausted due to the repetitive stimulation of clinical HD. Hence, dialysis modalities with longer duration or greater frequency may be associated with a less beneficial PLT activation profile, which may counteract their clinical benefits.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Platelet (PLT) dysfunction, which is a well-known phenomenon in advanced chronic renal failure, corresponds positively with CVD in these patients. The accumulation of retained uraemic toxins might play an important role in this respect. During haemodialysis (HD), both an increase in the expression of the platelet (PLT) cell surface molecule P-selectin (CD62p) and the release of intra-granular substances, such as platelet factor 4 (PF4) and ss-thromboglobulin (BTG), have been described. As the removal of uraemic toxins is superior during haemodiafiltration (HDF), this form of treatment may have quite another impact on PLTs than HD. Nineteen chronic HD patients who were treated with low-flux HD for at least 2 months were included in the Dutch CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST). After randomization, 10 patients continued low-flux HD and 9 patients switched to post-dilution HDF. The present study describes various parameters of PLT activation and degranulation at baseline (during HD) and after 3 months (during HDF) in the latter group of patients. At both time points, multiple blood samples were drawn. During the first 30 min of treatment, differences over the extracorporeal circuit (ECC) were calculated by taking samples from both afferent (arterial) and efferent (venous) lines. Correlations between various parameters were calculated in the total group of patients after 3 months. Immediately after the start of HD, PLT counts dropped over the ECC. During HDF, PLT counts decreased even more and reached a nadir at t30. CD62p expression increased early during HD and returned to baseline thereafter. During HDF, these changes were more pronounced and more protracted. With respect to degranulation, rather dissimilar results were obtained. During HD, both PF4 and BTG increased over time, whereas during HDF, PF4 increased but BTG did not change. Haemoconcentration and transmembrane pressure (TMP) within the dialyser were, respectively, approximately 10 and 3x higher during HDF than during HD. There was a striking correlation between the changes in haemoconcentration and the changes in both PLT counts and CD62p over the ECC. PLT activation, as measured by the expression of CD62p, was more pronounced and more protracted during HDF than during HD. During HDF, PLTs were trapped abundantly within the ECC, not only after first passage, but also thereafter. The degranulation product BTG increased during HD, but did not change during HDF. These observations may well be explained by the greater haemoconcentration and/or higher TMP during HDF on the one hand, and superior convective transport at the other. Whether the potential harmful effects of enhanced PLT activation are counterbalanced by the beneficial effects of an increased convective transport of degranulation products remains to be established.},

However, it is still unknown whether survival rates of short-stem hips match current standards. We made a systematic summary of reported overall survival after short-stem total hip arthroplasty. We conducted a systematic review of English, French, German, and Dutch literature. 2 assessors independently identified clinical studies on short-stem hip arthroplasty. After recalculating reported revision rates, we determined whether each implant had a projected revision rate of 10% or less at 10 years of follow-up or a revision rate per 100 observed component years of 1 or less. Stems were classified as "collum", "partial collum", or "trochanter-sparing". We found 49 studies, or 51 cohorts, involving 19 different stems. There was a large increase in recent publications. The majority of studies included had a follow-up of less than 5 years. We found a large number of observational studies on "partial collum" and "trochanter-sparing" stems, demonstrating adequate survival rates at medium-term follow-up. Clinical evidence from "collum stem" studies was limited to a small number of studies with a medium-term follow-up period. These studies did not show a satisfactory overall survival rate.},

  abstract = {Mental health disorders are the leading cause of health-related problems worldwide. It is projected that mental health disorders will be the leading cause of morbidity among adults as the incidence rates of anxiety and depression grow worldwide. Recently, "extended reality" (XR), a general term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), is paving the way for the delivery of mental health care. We aimed to investigate the adoption and implementation of XR technology used in interventions for mental disorders and to provide statistical analyses of the design, usage, and effectiveness of XR technology for mental health interventions with a worldwide demographic focus. In this paper, we conducted a scoping review of the development and application of XR in the area of mental disorders. We performed a database search to identify relevant studies indexed in Google Scholar, PubMed, and the ACM Digital Library. A search period between August 2016 and December 2023 was defined to select papers related to the usage of VR, AR, and MR in a mental health context. The database search was performed with predefined queries, and a total of 831 papers were identified. Ten papers were identified through professional recommendation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed and applied to ensure that only relevant studies were included in the literature review. We identified a total of 85 studies from 27 countries worldwide that used different types of VR, AR, and MR techniques for managing 14 types of mental disorders. By performing data analysis, we found that most of the studies focused on high-income countries, such as the United States (n=14, 16.47%) and Germany (n=12, 14.12%). None of the studies were for African countries. The majority of papers reported that XR techniques lead to a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or depression. The majority of studies were published in 2021 (n=26, 30.59%). This could indicate that mental disorder intervention received higher attention when COVID-19 emerged. Most studies (n=65, 76.47%) focused on a population in the age range of 18-65 years, while few studies (n=2, 3.35%) focused on teenagers (ie, subjects in the age range of 10-19 years). In addition, more studies were conducted experimentally (n=67, 78.82%) rather than by using analytical and modeling approaches (n=8, 9.41%). This shows that there is a rapid development of XR technology for mental health care. Furthermore, these studies showed that XR technology can effectively be used for evaluating mental disorders in a similar or better way that conventional approaches. In this scoping review, we studied the adoption and implementation of XR technology for mental disorder care. Our review shows that XR treatment yields high patient satisfaction, and follow-up assessments show significant improvement with large effect sizes. Moreover, the studies adopted unique designs that were set up to record and analyze the symptoms reported by their participants. This review may aid future research and development of various XR mechanisms for differentiated mental disorder procedures.},

The principles of Intervention Mapping were applied to combine theory and evidence in the development, implementation and planning for the evaluation of a participatory workplace intervention, aimed at an early return-to-work for sick-listed employees with SMDs. All stakeholders were involved in focus group interviews: i.e. employees recently sick-listed with SMDs, supervisors and occupational health professionals. The development of the participatory workplace intervention according to the Intervention Mapping principles resulted in a structured return-to-work intervention, specifically tailored to the needs of sick-listed employees with SMDs. Return-to-work was proposed as a behavioural change, and the Attitude - Social influence - self-Efficacy model was identified as a theoretical framework. Stakeholder involvement in focus group interviews served to enhance the implementation. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Intervention Mapping was found to be a promising method to develop interventions tailored to a specific target group in the field of occupational health.},

One of the treatments for PTSD, prolonged exposure (PE), is effective but has high drop-out rates and remission rates are relatively low. An intensified form of PE (iPE) was associated with good response and low drop-out rates in PTSD and has not yet been tested in a controlled trial in CA-PTSD. Phase-based treatment (PBT), in which PE is preceded by skills training may improve overall outcomes in this population. We will assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of standard PE, iPE and PBT in patients with CA-PTSD. Multi-center randomized controlled trial. Treatment conditions are: prolonged exposure (PE; maximum of 16 sessions in 16 weeks); intensified PE (iPE; maximum of 12 sessions in four weeks and two booster sessions); phase-based treatment (PBT; maximum of eight sessions skills training followed by eight sessions PE in 16 weeks).

  abstract = {Working alliance is considered an important determinant of outcome of psychotherapy. Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childhood abuse (CA-PTSD) may have challenges in building interpersonal relationships, including working alliance. Phase-based treatment provides an opportunity to strengthen alliance prior to trauma-focused treatment. This study aimed to compare the development of working alliance among patients with CA-PTSD in three variants of prolonged exposure (PE) therapy: standard PE, intensive PE (iPE), and skill training in affective and interpersonal regulation + prolonged exposure (STAIR + PE). We also examined the effect of alliance on treatment outcome and dropout. Self-reported PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (Blevins et al., 2015) and patient-rated Working Alliance Inventory (Tracey & Kokotovic, 1989) were assessed in a clinical trial. We analyzed data from 138 adult patients (76.1% female; 42% non-Western). Analyses were performed using mixed-effects models. Patients established a satisfactory alliance early in treatment, which increased over time. For PE and STAIR + PE, a larger decrease in PTSD symptom severity was related to a higher alliance in the subsequent session, but not the other way around. In STAIR + PE, a higher alliance in Phase 1 was related to lower PTSD symptoms in Phase 2. In all conditions, a higher initial working alliance was related to a lower chance of treatment dropout. In the treatment of CA-PTSD, all three variants of prolonged exposure foster positive development of the working alliance. Across conditions, working alliance did not precede symptom decline. Therapists should strive for a strong alliance at the beginning of treatment as this reduces the likelihood of dropout. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).},

In this study we introduced Rosea1 (ROS1, a MYB type) and Delila (DEL, a bHLH type), into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration. ROS1 and DEL form a pair of well-characterized TFs from Snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), which specifically induce anthocyanin accumulation when expressed in tomato fruit. In N. benthamiana, robust induction of a single anthocyanin, delphinidin-3-rutinoside (D3R) was observed after expression of both ROS1 and DEL. Surprisingly in addition to D3R, a range of additional metabolites were also strongly and specifically up-regulated upon expression of ROS1 and DEL. Except for the D3R, these induced compounds were not derived from the flavonoid pathway. Most notable among these are nornicotine conjugates with butanoyl, hexanoyl, and octanoyl hydrophobic moieties, and phenylpropanoid-polyamine conjugates such as caffeoyl putrescine. The defensive properties of the induced molecules were addressed in bioassays using the tobacco specialist lepidopteran insect Manduca sexta. Our study showed that the effect of ROS1 and DEL expression in N. benthamiana leaves extends beyond the flavonoid pathway. Apparently the same transcription factor may regulate different secondary metabolite pathways in different plant species.},

The aim of this study was to retrospectively describe CGM metrics for people with liver GSDs and IKH. CGM metrics (descriptive, glycemic variation and glycemic control parameters) were calculated for 47 liver GSD and 14 IKH patients, categorized in cohorts by disease subtype, age and treatment status, and compared to published age-matched CGM metrics from healthy individuals. Glycemic control was assessed as time-in-range (TIR; ≥3.9 - ≤7.8 and ≥3.9 - ≤10.0 mmol/L), time-below-range (TBR; <3.0 mmol/L and ≥3.0 - ≤3.9 mmol/L), and time-above-range (TAR; >7.8 and >10.0 mmol/L). Despite all patients receiving dietary treatment, GSD cohorts displayed significantly different CGM metrics compared to healthy individuals. Decreased TIR together with increased TAR were noted in GSD I, GSD III, and GSD XI (Fanconi-Bickel syndrome) cohorts (all p < 0.05). In addition, all GSD I cohorts showed increased TBR (all p < 0.05). In GSD IV an increased TBR (p < 0.05) and decreased TAR were noted (p < 0.05). In GSD IX only increased TAR was observed (p < 0.05). IKH patient cohorts, both with and without treatment, presented CGM metrics similar to healthy individuals. Despite dietary treatment, most liver GSD cohorts do not achieve CGM metrics comparable to healthy individuals. International recommendations on the use of CGM and clinical targets for CGM metrics in liver GSD patients are warranted, both for patient care and clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Outdoor ranges in free-range laying hen systems are often underutilised, likely due to their open, uncovered nature. Given that the domestic chicken's ancestor inhabits forests with high canopy cover, similar habitat preferences can be expected. To assess the impact of vegetation cover, range use was recorded on two outdoor ranges before and one and two years after planting bushes. A barrier tape grid was placed on each outdoor range, images were taken every 10 min over three days and hens per quadrant were counted. Data were analysed using general additive models. On both outdoor ranges, the number of hens increased in quadrants with newly planted bushes. While hen numbers declined with increasing distance from the shed in all three years, this effect diminished in the two years after planting. Furthermore, hens on both outdoor ranges in all three years showed diurnal patterns in range use, resembling the natural behaviour of their ancestor. The findings support the hypothesis that vegetation cover plays a crucial role in promoting more even range use, including in parts further away from the shed. To encourage natural behaviour and mitigate the negative effects of poor range utilisation, outdoor ranges should incorporate evenly distributed vegetation cover.},

Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired nitric oxide (NO) production, contributes to vasoconstriction, inflammation, and coagulation abnormalities seen in COVID-19. In this study, we investigated the impact of COVID-19 patient-derived plasma on the endothelium through NO metabolite analysis using an in vitro 3D micro vessel model. Our experiments revealed alterations in NO metabolites in response to COVID-19 patient plasma perfusion, with BH4+BH2 supplementation improving citrulline levels in severe COVID-19 patient models. Positive correlation between arginase activity and eNOS activity was observed in the severe COVID-19 patient model but not in the mild COVID-19 patient model.

The idea that children receive too many vaccines simultaneously and that vaccination interferes with natural development had a negative effect on attitudes. Dutch parents believe that doctors only inform them about the benefits of vaccination and disregard possible drawbacks. Since attitudes did not appear to be the result of thorough deliberation, parents could easily be influenced by negative publicity about vaccination.

The Spurling and shoulder abduction tests are the two most common examinations used to identify cervical radicular pain. MRI without contrast, CT scanning, and in some cases plain radiography can all be appropriate imaging techniques for nontraumatic cervical radiculopathy. MRI is recommended prior to interventional treatments. Exercise with or without other treatments can be beneficial.

By contrast, for chronic cervical radicular pain, the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid administration is limited. In these patients, pulsed radiofrequency treatment adjacent to the dorsal root ganglion may be considered. There is currently no gold standard for the diagnosis of cervical radicular pain.

Medical imaging studies can demonstrate or exclude specific underlying pathologies and identify nerve root irritation, while selective diagnostic nerve root blocks can be used to confirm the affected level(s). In subacute lumbosacral radicular pain, transforaminal corticosteroid administration provides short-term pain relief and improves mobility. In chronic lumbosacral radicular pain, pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) treatment adjacent to the spinal ganglion (DRG) can provide pain relief for a longer period in well-selected patients. In cases of refractory pain, epidural adhesiolysis and spinal cord stimulation can be considered in experienced centers. The diagnosis of lumbosacral radicular pain is based on a combination of history, clinical examination, and additional investigations. Epidural steroids can be considered for subacute lumbosacral radicular pain. In chronic lumbosacral radicular pain, PRF adjacent to the DRG is recommended. SCS and epidural adhesiolysis can be considered for cases of refractory pain in specialized centers.},

Although rewarming of patients before surgery has been used as a preventive measure and some guidelines recommend it, the implementation of prewarming for every surgical patient is cumbersome. Therefore, we sought to determine the efficacy of two novel prewarming methods that could facilitate prewarming in daily practice. This was a prospective, randomized, multi-center, controlled study. After IRB approval and informed consent, 90 patients undergoing surgery of 30-120 min duration with general anesthesia were randomly assigned to three groups: 1) standard preoperative insulation (Group A); 2) passive preoperative insulation with a commercial prewarming suit (Group B); 3) active preoperative prewarming with a forced-air warmer connected to a prewarming suit (Group C). All patients received warmed IV fluids and intraoperative forced air warming after induction of anesthesia. Oral temperatures were recorded in the preoperative and postoperative periods. Intraoperative core temperatures were measured with an esophageal probe. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Scheffé's test identified a significantly higher core temperature in the actively prewarmed group (Group C) compared to both passive groups (A, B) at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min (P<0.05) after induction of anesthesia and at the end of surgery. During the first 30 min after admission at PACU, also higher oral temperatures were measured in Group C, compared with both passive insulation groups. In our study active prewarming with a forced-air warmer and an insulating prewarming suit achieves significantly higher core temperatures during anesthesia and at the end of surgery and avoids hypothermia at the end of surgery compared to commercial or conventional insulation techniques.},

Although the specific content of programs varies according to the domain focus, programs usually address similar concepts: knowledge, attitudinal beliefs, social influences and skills. This apparent conceptual overlap between behaviors and programs provides opportunities for a transfer-oriented approach which will stimulate students to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in one domain (e.g. skills for resisting tobacco use) to other domains (e.g. alcohol, sex). A requirement for such an approach is that behaviors share at least some determinants. This review addresses this issue by examining similarities between domain-specific determinants of smoking, drinking, safe sex and healthy nutrition among adolescents. Recent empirical studies and reviews were examined. The results show that the following determinants are relevant to all four behaviors: beliefs about immediate gratification and social advantages, peer norms, peer and parental modeling and refusal self-efficacy. Several other determinants have been found to relate to at least two behaviors, e.g. health risk beliefs and parental norms. These results can be used for the development of a transfer-oriented school health promotion curriculum.},

This review systematically summarizes the current evidence on the predictive value of QST for chronic postoperative pain and the effect of pharmacological interventions. The main outcome measures were posttreatment pain intensity, pain relief, presence of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain, responders of 30% and 50% pain relief, or validated questionnaires on pain and disability. A systematic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE yielded 25 studies on surgical interventions and 11 on pharmacological interventions. Seventeen surgical and 11 pharmacological studies reported an association between preoperative or pretreatment QST and chronic postoperative pain or analgesic effect. The most commonly assessed QST modalities were pressure stimuli (17 studies), temporal summation of pain (TSP, 14 studies), and conditioned pain modulation (CPM, 16 studies). Of those, the dynamic QST parameters TSP (50%) and CPM (44%) were most frequently associated with chronic postoperative pain and analgesic effects. A large heterogeneity in methods for assessing TSP (n = 4) and CPM (n = 7) was found. Overall, most studies demonstrated low-to-moderate levels of risk of bias in study design, attrition, prognostic factors, outcome, and statistical analyses. This systematic review demonstrates that TSP and CPM show the most consistent predictive values for chronic postoperative pain and analgesic effect, but the heterogeneous methodologies reduce the generalizability and hence call for methodological guidelines.},

Recent advances in venom gland transcriptomic and venom peptidomic/proteomic technologies combined with bioactivity screening approaches lead to the identification of new toxins with original pharmacological profiles. Here, from transcriptomic/proteomic analyses of the Conus consors cone snail, we identified a new conopeptide called τ-CnVA, which displays the typical cysteine framework V of the T1-conotoxin superfamily. This peptide was chemically synthesized and its three-dimensional structure was solved by NMR analysis and compared to that of TxVA belonging to the same family, revealing very few common structural features apart a common orientation of the intercysteine loop. Because of the lack of a clear biological function associated with the T-conotoxin family, τ-CnVA was screened against more than fifty different ion channels and receptors, highlighting its capacity to interact selectively with the somatostatine sst3 receptor. Pharmacological and functional studies show that τ-CnVA displays a micromolar (Ki of 1.5μM) antagonist property for the sst3 receptor, being currently the only known toxin to interact with this GPCR subfamily.},

We studied children from the Dutch EuroPrevall birth cohort study (N = 20 CMA, N = 23 controls, N = 10 tolerant boys), age and gender matched. CMA was challenge proven. Bisulfite converted DNA (blood) was analyzed using the 450K infinium DNA-methylation array. Four groups (combined, girls, boys and tolerant boys) were analysed between CMA and controls. Statistical analysis and pathway-analysis were performed in "R" using IMA, Minfi and the global-test package. Differentially methylated regions in DHX58, ZNF281, EIF42A and HTRA2 genes were validated by quantitative amplicon sequencing (ROCHE 454(®)). General hypermethylation was found in the CMA group compared to control children, while this effect was absent in the tolerant group. Methylation differences were, among others, found in regions of DHX58, ZNF281, EIF42A and HTRA2 genes. Several of these genes are known to be involved in immunological pathways and associated with other allergies. We show that epigenetic associations are involved in CMA. Although, the statistical power of our study is limited and our sample was based on whole blood, we were still able to detect feasible loci and pathways. Therefore our findings might contribute to future diagnostic or therapeutic interventions for specific CMA. Further studies have to confirm the findings of our study.},

It is caused by mutations in one of the genes encoding collagen type IV. In recent years, new and innovative imaging techniques have added characteristics of ocular alterations in AS and provided new insights, including into the pathogenesis of the disease. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the current knowledge of ocular changes in AS, as well as to present the Alport ocular pass. Narrative review article. Ocular manifestations of AS include changes in the cornea, lens, and retina. Specifically, posterior polymorphic corneal dystrophy, anterior lenticonus (pathognomonic for AS), and various retinal changes have been described, which have been further characterized in recent years by newer imaging techniques. In particular, foveal changes in AS may present as both a thickened central retina in the context of foveal hypoplasia or a staircase-like thinning of the fovea. Both lesions could provide further insights into the role of type IV collagen in ocular structures. The AS can manifest in various structures of the eye. The staircase-like changes of the central retina in AS patients indicate the important role of collagen type IV in the homeostasis and regular function of the inner retinal layers. The often mild foveal hypoplasia may provide clues to the role of collagen type IV in retinal embryogenesis. While anterior lenticonus is pathognomonic for AS and can be treated easily by refractive lens exchange, the only option currently available for retinal alterations is close follow-up and, if necessary, treatment of systemic complications of AS.},

Mosaic corneal degeneration, presenile cataract and secondary glaucoma are associated with XMC. Beside that CHRDL1 encodes Ventroptin, a secreted bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist, the molecular mechanism of XMC is not well understood yet. In a family with broad phenotypic variability of XMC, we identified the novel CHRDL1 frameshift mutation c.807_808delTC [p.H270Wfs*22] presumably causing CHRDL1 loss of function. Using Xenopus laevis as model organism, we demonstrate that chrdl1 is specifically expressed in the ocular tissue at late developmental stages. The chrdl1 knockdown directly resembles the human XMC phenotype and confirms CHRDL1 deficiency to cause XMC. Interestingly, secondary to this bmp4 is down-regulated in the Xenopus eyes. Moreover, phospho-SMAD1/5 is altered and BMP receptor 1A is reduced in a XMC patient. Together, we classify these observations as negative-feedback regulation due to the deficient BMP antagonism in XMC. As CHRDL1 is preferentially expressed in the limbal stem cell niche of adult human cornea, we assume that CHRDL1 plays a key role in cornea homeostasis. In conclusion, we provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of XMC as well as into the specific role of CHRDL1 during cornea organogenesis, among others by the establishment of the first XMC in vivo model. We show that unravelling monogenic cornea disorders like XMC-with presumably disturbed cornea growth and differentiation-contribute to the identification of potential limbal stem cell niche factors that are promising targets for regenerative therapies of corneal injuries.},

To see which factor accounts for the difference between the two methods we measured cardiac output and MTT independently and compared the volumes with those obtained by dilution of Evans blue (BVEB). Prospective animal study. University department of experimental anaesthesiology. Six anaesthetised, spontaneously breathing dogs with chronically implanted ultrasound flow probes around the pulmonary artery. BVMTT and BVTinj agreed closely (48 +/- 2 ml.kg-1 and 49 +/- 2 ml.kg-1), but underestimated blood volume by about 40% compared with BVEB (75 +/- 1 ml.kg-1). Transit times measured were 33 +/- 1 s and should be about 50 s as calculated from the quotient of BVEB and cardiac output. Both methods underestimate blood volume by about the same extent compared with BVEB, probably because slowly perfused compartments are not detected during the short measurement period of 4 min. In the case of the transit time approach, rather short transit times result and in the case of the mass conservation principle, back-extra-polation yields rather high plasma concentrations of ICG at the time of injection. Accordingly, the two methods seem to be equivalent for measuring blood volume rapidly, although the absolute volume is underestimated by about 40%.},

The problem of the presence of the interference in the samples and system was successfully solved by careful optimization of chromatographic conditions. Charged hybrid stationary phase modified with pentafluorophenyl group and optimized gradient elution provided adequate separation selectivity and peak shapes. The impurity was identified as dibutyl phthalate and had the same m/z ions as farnesol leading to an important interference on selected reaction monitoring channel. Two different types of biological matrices originating from vaginal fluid, supernatant and sediment, were analysed. Micro-solid phase extraction in pipette tips was optimized for the selective isolation of QSM from the supernatant. The insufficient retention of farnesol on the extraction sorbent was improved when 1% of organic solvent was added prior to extraction, while the retention of tyrosol was only possible when using combined C8 and polymer sorbent type. Strong retention of farnesol had to be solved by increasing elution solvent strength and volume up to 600 μL. However, this approach did not allow the pretreatment of sediment samples due to the sorbent clogging. Therefore, our previously developed protein precipitation method was modified and validated to analyse the sediments. New developed UHPLC-MS/MS method provided suitable accuracy and precision for the determination of QSM in vaginal fluid while using only 50 μL sample volume and two different sample preparation methods.},

  abstract = {Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle occurs when intensity stimuli precede stronger startle-inducing stimuli by 10-1000 ms. PPI deficits are found in individuals with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, and they correlate with other cognitive impairments. Animal research and clinical studies have demonstrated that both PPI and cognitive function can be enhanced by nicotine. PPI has been shown to be mediated, at least in part, by mesopontine cholinergic neurons that project to pontine startle neurons and activate muscarinic and potentially nicotine receptors (nAChRs). The subtypes and anatomical location of nAChRs involved in mediating and modulating PPI remain unresolved. We tested the hypothesis that nAChRs that are expressed by pontine startle neurons contribute to PPI. We also explored whether or not these pontine receptors are responsible for the nicotine enhancement of PPI. While systemic administration of nAChR antagonists had limited effects on PPI, PnC microinfusions of the non-α7nAChR preferring antagonist TMPH, but not of the α7nAChR antagonist MLA, into the PnC significantly reduced PPI. Electrophysiological recordings from startle-mediating PnC neurons confirmed that nicotine affects excitability of PnC neurons, which could be antagonized by TMPH, but not by MLA, indicating the expression of non-α7nAChR. In contrast, systemic nicotine enhancement of PPI was only reversed by systemic MLA and not by TMPH or local microinfusions of MLA into the PnC. In summary, our data indicate that non-α7nAChRs in the PnC contribute to PPI at stimulus intervals of 100 ms or less, whereas activation of α7nAChRs in other brain areas is responsible for the systemic nicotine enhancement of PPI. This is important knowledge for the correct interpretation of behavioral, preclinical, and clinical data as well as for developing drugs for the amelioration of PPI deficits and the enhancement of cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) represents an enormous clinical challenge as loss of myocardium due to ischemic injury is associated with compromised left ventricular (LV) function often leading to acute cardiac decompensation or chronic heart failure. S100A1 was recently identified as a positive inotropic regulator of myocardial contractility in vitro and in vivo. Here, we explore the strategy of myocardial S100A1 gene therapy either at the time of, or 2 h after, MI to preserve global heart function. Rats underwent cryothermia-induced MI and in vivo intracoronary delivery of adenoviral transgenes (4 x 10(10) pfu). Animals received saline (MI), the S100A1 adenovirus (MI/AdS100A1), a control adenovirus (MI/AdGFP), or a sham operation. S100A1 gene delivery preserved global in vivo LV function 1 week after MI. Preservation of LV function was due mainly to S100A1-mediated gain of contractility of the remaining, viable myocardium since contractile parameters and Ca(2+) transients of isolated MI/AdS100A1 myocytes were significantly enhanced compared to myocytes isolated from both MI/AdGFP and sham groups. Moreover, S100A1 gene therapy preserved the cardiac beta-adrenergic inotropic reserve, which was associated with the attenuation of GRK2 up-regulation. Also, S100A1 overexpression reduced cardiac hypertrophy 1 week post-MI. Overall, our data indicate that S100A1 gene therapy provides a potential novel treatment strategy to maintain contractile performance of the post-MI heart.},

  abstract = {S100A1, a Ca(2+)-binding protein of the EF-hand type, is known to modulate sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) handling in skeletal muscle and cardiomyocytes. Recently, S100A1 has been shown to be expressed in endothelial cells (ECs). Because intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) transients can be involved in important EC functions and endothelial NO synthase activity, we sought to investigate the impact of endothelial S100A1 on the regulation of endothelial and vascular function. Thoracic aortas from S100A1 knockout mice (SKO) showed significantly reduced relaxation in response to acetylcholine compared with wild-type vessels, whereas direct vessel relaxation using sodium nitroprusside was unaltered. Endothelial dysfunction attributable to the lack of S100A1 expression could also be demonstrated in vivo and translated into hypertension of SKO. Mechanistically, both basal and acetylcholine-induced endothelial NO release of SKO aortas was significantly reduced compared with wild type. Impaired endothelial NO production in SKO could be attributed, at least in part, to diminished agonist-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transients in ECs. Consistently, silencing endothelial S100A1 expression in wild type also reduced [Ca(2+)](i) and NO generation. Moreover, S100A1 overexpression in ECs further increased NO generation that was blocked by the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor blocker 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate. Finally, cardiac endothelial S100A1 expression was shown to be downregulated in heart failure in vivo. Collectively, endothelial S100A1 critically modulates vascular function because lack of S100A1 expression leads to decreased [Ca(2+)](i) and endothelial NO release, which contributes, at least partially, to impaired endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation and hypertension in SKO mice. Targeting endothelial S100A1 expression may, therefore, be a novel therapeutic means to improve endothelial function in vascular disease or heart failure.},

  abstract = {Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system is frequent in subjects with cardiovascular disease. The contribution of different forms of renovascular hypertension and the mechanisms contributing to autonomic dysfunction in hypertension are incompletely understood. Here, murine models of renovascular hypertension with preserved (2-kidneys-1 clip, 2K1C) and reduced (1-kidney-1 clip, 1K1C) kidney mass were studied with regard to autonomic nervous system regulation (sympathetic tone: power-spectral analysis of systolic blood pressure; parasympathetic tone: power-spectral analysis of heart rate) and baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate by spontaneous, concomitant changes of systolic blood pressure and pulse interval. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin system and the rho-kinase pathway were determined by application of inhibitors. C57BL6N mice (6 to 11) with reduced kidney mass (1K1C) or with preserved kidney mass (2K1C) developed a similar degree of hypertension. In comparison to control mice, both models presented with a significantly increased sympathetic tone and lower baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate. However, only 2K1C animals had a lower parasympathetic tone, whereas urinary norepinephrine excretion was reduced in the 1K1C model. Rho kinase inhibition given to a subset of 1K1C and 2K1C animals improved baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate selectively in the 1K1C model. Rho kinase inhibition had no additional effects on autonomic nervous system in either model of renovascular hypertension and did not change the blood pressure. Blockade of AT1 receptors (in 2K1C animals) normalized the sympathetic tone, decreased resting heart rate, improved baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate and parasympathetic tone. Regardless of residual renal mass, blood pressure and sympathetic tone are increased, whereas baroreflex sensitivity is depressed in murine models of renovascular hypertension. Reduced norepinephrine excretion and/or degradation might contribute to sympathoactivation in renovascular hypertension with reduced renal mass (1K1C). Overall, the study helps to direct research to optimize medical therapy of hypertension.},

It was shown that MPI inversely correlated strongly with the maximum derivative of LV pressure with respect to time (+dP/dtmax). The current study evaluated the change of MPI during and immediately after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) surgery and analyzed the relationship between MPI and hydraulic energy (exemplified by preload adjusted maximal power-PAMP) during that same period. The study was conducted in 45 patients undergoing CABG. After induction of anaesthesia, 10 min after revascularization and 2 h postoperatively, haemodynamics were assessed. Preload was characterized by LV end-diastolic area indexed for BSA (LVEDAI); afterload was estimated by arterial elastance (Ea) and indexed systemic vascular resistance (SVRI). Global myocardial performance was indicated in terms of MPI and contractility was achieved by PAMP. Myocardial performance index increased postoperatively (0.44 +/- 0.13, 0.37 +/- 0.17 and 0.50 +/- 0.16, respectively; P < 0.001). Preload adjusted maximal power did not alter significantly (1.90 +/- 1.24, 2.02 +/- 1.34 and 2.12 +/- 1.00 W cm(-2)*10(4), respectively). Left ventricular enddiastolic area indexed did not change. Arterial elastance augmented to 0.76 +/- 0.39, 0.80 +/- 0.40 and 1.01 +/- 0.43 mmHg ml(-1), respectively; P < 0.001. Systemic vascular resistance did not change. A relationship was found between 1-MPI/LVEDAI2 and PAMP (R2 = 0.50). This study shows that in the setting of CABG surgery, MPI appears to be a good measure of global LV function.},

Using NMR, Nechama et al. determined the structure of the IRAK-M death domain monomer (PDBid: 5UKE). With this structure, they performed a docking study to model the location of IRAK-M in the Myddosome. Based on this, they present a molecular basis for selectivity of IRAK-M towards IRAK1 over IRAK2 binding. When we attempted to use 5UKE as a homology modeling template, we noticed that our 5UKE-based models had structural issues, such as disallowed torsion angles and solvent exposed tryptophans. We therefore analyzed the NMR ensemble of 5UKE using structure validation tools and we compared 5UKE with homologous high-resolution X-ray structures. We identified several structural anomalies in 5UKE, including packing issues, frayed helices and improbable side chain conformations. We used Yasara to build a homology model, based on two high resolution death domain crystal structures, as an alternative model for the IRAK-M death domain (atomic coordinates, modeling details and validation are available at https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/service/5uke/). Our model agrees better with known death domain structure information than 5UKE and also with the chemical shift data that was deposited for 5UKE.},

  abstract = {Positive social relationships are paramount for the survival of mammals and beneficial for mental and physical health, buffer against stressors, and even promote appropriate immune system functioning. By contrast, impaired social relationships, social isolation, or the loss of a bonded partner lead to aggravated physical and mental health. For example, in humans partner loss is detrimental for the functioning of the immune system and heightens the susceptibility for the development of post-traumatic stress disorders, anxiety disorders, and major depressive disorders. To understand potential underlying mechanisms, the monogamous prairie vole can provide important insights. In the present study, we separated pair bonded male and female prairie voles after five days of co-housing, subjected them to the forced swim test on the fourth day following separation, and studied their microglia morphology and activation in specific brain regions. Partner loss increased passive stress-coping in male, but not female, prairie voles. Moreover, partner loss was associated with microglial priming within the parvocellular region of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in male prairie voles, whereas in female prairie voles the morphological activation within the whole PVN and the prelimbic cortex (PrL) was decreased, marked by a shift towards ramified microglial morphology. Expression of the immediate early protein c-Fos following partner loss was changed within the PrL of male, but not female, prairie voles. However, the loss of a partner did not affect the investigated aspects of the peripheral immune response. These data suggest a potential sex-dependent mechanism for the regulation of microglial activity following the loss of a partner, which might contribute to the observed differences in passive stress-coping. This study furthers our understanding of the effects of partner loss and its short-term impact on the CNS as well as the CNS immune system and the peripheral innate immune system in both male and female prairie voles.},

Binding of H1H to a double strand DNA oligonucleotide was monitored through the chemical shift perturbation of backbone amide resonances, and showed that the interaction surface involves not only the b2 segment but also several residues in the b1 and HLH regions.},

Nuclear BAP1 immunopositivity was used to evaluate the presence of functional BAP1 in the tumor. Next-generation sequencing using Ion Torrent platform was used to determine pathogenic variants of BAP1, EIF1AX, SF3B1, GNAQ and GNA11 and chromosome 3 status in the tumor or in DNA extracted from blood or saliva. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier estimates. The mean age at diagnosis was 17 years (range 5.0-24.8).

One tumor had a somatic SF3B1 pathogenic variant. Disomy 3 and the absence of a BAP1 pathogenic variant in the tumor predicted the longest metastasis-free survival. Males showed longer metastasis-free survival than females (P = 0.018). We did not find a stronger-than-average BAP1 germline predisposition for choroidal and ciliary body melanoma among children and young adults compared to adults.

  abstract = {The pathogenesis and therapy of Shigatoxin 2 (Stx2)-mediated kidney failure remain controversial. Our aim was to test whether, during an infection with Stx2-producing E. coli (STEC), Stx2 exerts direct effects on renal tubular epithelium and thereby possibly contributes to acute renal failure. Mice represent a suitable model because they, like humans, express the Stx2-receptor Gb3 in the tubular epithelium but, in contrast to humans, not in glomerular endothelia, and are thus free of glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). In wild-type mice, Stx2 caused acute tubular dysfunction with consequent electrolyte disturbance, which was most likely the cause of death. Tubule-specific depletion of Gb3 protected the mice from acute renal failure. In vitro, Stx2 induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis in human tubular epithelial cells, thus implicating a direct effect of Stx2 on the tubular epithelium. To correlate these results to human disease, kidney biopsies and outcome were analysed in patients with Stx2-associated kidney failure (n = 11, aged 22-44 years). The majority of kidney biopsies showed different stages of an ongoing TMA; however, no glomerular complement activation could be demonstrated. All biopsies, including those without TMA, showed severe acute tubular damage. Due to these findings, patients were treated with supportive therapy without complement-inhibiting antibodies (eculizumab) or immunoadsorption. Despite the severity of the initial disease [creatinine 6.34 (1.31-17.60) mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 1944 (753-2792) U/l, platelets 33 (19-124)/nl and haemoglobin 6.2 (5.2-7.8) g/dl; median (range)], all patients were discharged after 33 (range 19-43) days with no neurological symptoms and no dialysis requirement [creatinine 1.39 (range 0.84-2.86) mg/dl]. The creatinine decreased further to 0.90 (range 0.66-1.27) mg/dl after 24 months. Based on these data, one may surmise that acute tubular damage represents a separate pathophysiological mechanism, importantly contributing to Stx2-mediated acute kidney failure. Specifically in young adults, an excellent outcome can be achieved by supportive therapy only.},

We postulated that with fast magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, accurate detection of anomalous coronary arteries and unambiguous delineation of their proximal course is feasible. In a selected group of 38 patients, 19 of them having an anomalously originating coronary artery, a fast MR angiographic technique was used to study the proximal coronary anatomy. Blinded analysis of randomly ordered MR studies was performed independently by two observers. Both origin and proximal course of the coronary arteries were defined. Two cardiologists reviewed all x-ray coronary angiograms. After the separate analyses, a final consensus result was defined for each patient. In 37 patients, successful MR coronary angiography could be performed. Interobserver agreement for determining both origin and proximal course was 100%. An x-ray coronary angiogram was available in 36 patients. In 3 patients (all with an anomalous left main coronary artery originating from the right aortic sinus), there was disagreement about the proximal course between the results of MR and x-ray coronary angiography. Review of these cases demonstrated that MR angiography had unambiguously visualized the proximal coronary artery course, whereas the results of x-ray angiography had been equivocal. Thus, sensitivity and specificity for detecting anomalous coronary arteries and delineating their proximal course were 100%. These data suggest that fast MR angiography is highly accurate in determining the origin and delineating the proximal course of anomalous coronary arteries, even in those cases in which x-ray coronary angiographic diagnosis is difficult or even erroneous.},

  abstract = {MR coronary angiography is most often performed using two-dimensional techniques. Although three-dimensional (3D) acquisitions do have important advantages, they take too long for a single breath-hold and are thus susceptible to respiratory motion artifacts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of a unique respiratory-gated 3D MR angiographic technique in identifying the proximal coronary arteries in patients suspected of having coronary artery disease. In addition, we investigated the capability of this technique to detect proximal stenoses. We performed a prospective blinded study in 20 patients who were referred for conventional coronary angiography. A cardiac-gated 3D gradient-echo sequence with fat suppression was used. Retrospective respiratory gating was performed using navigator echoes of the diaphragm position. Using multiplanar reformatting, two independent readers blindly analyzed the data sets for visualization of major coronary arteries, lengths of imaged segments, and detection of significant stenoses (> 50% occlusion of the luminal diameter by conventional angiography). Seventy-seven of 80 (96%) coronary arteries were positively identified. In one patient, an anomalous coronary anatomy was readily identified and confirmed by conventional angiography. The average lengths of the imaged segments of the right, left main, left anterior descending, and left circumflex coronary arteries were 58 +/- 13 mm, 9 +/- 5 mm, 59 +/- 16 mm, and 24 +/- 10 mm, respectively. Overall sensitivity for the detection of stenoses was low (38%), with a specificity of 95%. Interobserver agreement was 0.92, with a kappa value of 0.65. Respiratory-gated 3D MR angiography allows accurate identification of proximal coronary arteries and may be valuable for 3D imaging of coronary anomalies. Further technical improvements are required to enhance the value of the technique in detecting stenoses.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of magnetic resonance angiography in detecting proximal coronary artery stenoses is unclear. We postulated that fast magnetic resonance angiography is capable of (1) imaging proximal coronary arteries, and (2) detecting stenoses of > or = 50% of their luminal diameter. Thirty-five patients, referred for analysis of angina pectoris, underwent both conventional angiography and magnetic resonance angiography of coronary arteries. A fast k-space segmented gradient-echo technique was used during breath-holds. Two observers, blinded to the results of conventional angiography, independently analysed the magnetic resonance studies for (1) length of visualized segments, and (2) presence of signal voids indicative of stenoses. From 140 proximal arteries, 15 (11%) were excluded because of incomplete imaging or degraded image quality. Mean length of the visualized segments was 9 +/- 4 mm for the left main, 62 +/- 16 mm for the left anterior descending, 21 +/- 9 mm for the left circumflex and 89 +/- 32 mm for the right coronary artery. Sensitivity for detecting > or = 50% luminal diameter stenoses was 0.00 for the left circumflex, 0.53 for the left anterior descending coronary artery, 0.71 for the RCA and 1.00 for the left main artery. Specificity varied from 0.73 for the left anterior descending coronary artery to 0.96 for the left circumflex. Inter-observer agreement was 0.90. Thus, segmented magnetic resonance angiography is capable of non-invasive imaging of proximal coronary anatomy. Its good accuracy in detecting left main coronary artery disease, intermediate accuracy in detecting right coronary artery and left anterior descending coronary artery stenoses, and low accuracy in detecting left circumflex lesions fit within a range of sensitivities and specificities found by others. Further technical advances are necessary to make the technique clinically robust.},

  abstract = {At the Rotterdam branch of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, a cohort of 19,970 men ages 55-75 years is screened at an interval of 4 years. Screening includes systematic sextant needle biopsy for men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and/or positive findings on digital rectal examination or transrectal ultrasound. Detection during the second screening round of a large number of high-grade (Gleason Grade 4 or 5) malignancies and/or a large number of malignancies in general could be considered the result of a failure to identify these malignancies at an early stage, during prevalence screening. Men diagnosed during the second screening round with potentially advanced carcinoma (PAC), characterized by a biopsy Gleason score of 7 (4 + 3, or 3 + 4 with > 30% malignant involvement) or a biopsy Gleason score of 8-10, were identified. Clinical data, including PSA values on prevalence screening, biopsy history, clinical stage, and follow-up data, were retrieved for these patients. Tumor features were further analyzed in radical prostatectomy specimens. During the second screening round, 503 malignancies, including 30 (6.0%) with features of PAC on diagnostic biopsy, were detected in 11,210 patients. Curative treatment was offered to 26 patients. Prostatectomy demonstrated the presence of organ-confined disease in 11 of 12 specimens, and tumor volume ranged from 0.11-7.93 cm3 (median, 1.05 cm3). PSA failure was noted in 6 of 22 patients who were offered curative therapy. PAC is a rare finding in the second round of screening after a 4-year interval, and a substantial proportion of PAC cases detected in the second screening round represent organ-confined disease. The findings of the current study suggest that the screening protocol used is sufficiently effective for detecting > 95% of malignancies before they develop features that would make them incurable.},

Men with a benign biopsy in the 1st round had a significantly lower prostate cancer incidence in the 2nd round compared to men who did not undergo biopsy in the 1st round (10.7 vs. 22.7%, P < 0.0001). The decrease of prostate cancer detection in the 2nd round was associated with an increase in the incidence of PIN. Strikingly, LSPC diagnosed during the 1st round, but not during the 2nd round were predictive for prostate cancer, while isolated PIN was never predictive for prostate cancer. PIN should not be an indication for repeat biopsy in a screening population. Importantly a 1st round benign biopsy outcome proved to be a negative predictor of subsequent prostate cancer detection.},

Patient survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 73%, 63%, and 63%, respectively. Multivariate analysis of pre-transplant variables revealed prothrombin time, creatinine level, and indication for retransplantation, as independent predictive factors. Survival was highest in patients who had undergone retransplantation for hepatic artery thrombosis. Multivariate analysis, including pre-, per-, and post-operative variables, showed that era of transplantation, prothrombin time, blood loss, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, were independent predictive factors. Survival at 1 and 5 years improved from 56% and 48%, respectively, before 1996 to 89% and 81%, respectively, after 1996. In conclusion, survival after hepatic retransplantation improved significantly through the years.

In the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer, 4117 and 1840 men underwent sextant biopsy in the first and second screening round (4-year interval), respectively. Sextant biopsy was prompted by elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. For review, randomly taken benign sextant biopsies (n = 202) with a follow-up of at least 8 years were chosen. Before review, atrophy was reported in the biopsies of 11.4% and 8.7% of the first and second round, respectively. The prostate cancer incidence during 8 years of follow-up after an initial diagnosis of atrophy was 10.4%, which was not significantly different than the 12.3% of cancers detected after a benign diagnosis without reference to atrophy. After review, the incidence of simple atrophy, post-atrophic hyperplasia, and sclerotic atrophy in sextant biopsies was 91%, 47%, and 9%, respectively. Extensive atrophy was observed in 5% of biopsies. Only 2 men (4.7%) in the reviewed group had a subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer in the 8 years of follow-up. Additionally, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed in 3 men (7.0%) in the second screening round. Atrophy, especially its simple form, is a very common lesion in prostate biopsy cores (94%). Atrophy in an asymptomatic population undergoing screening was not associated with a greater prostate cancer or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia incidence during subsequent screening rounds.},

  abstract = {Epidemiologically, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in the Western world after skin cancer. To date, it is still unknown whether screening for prostate cancer is justified, because results of randomised clinical trials are not yet available. The available screening tests (i.e. prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test) do not always detect cancers that otherwise would have resulted in prostate cancer mortality. Favourable results from prostate cancer screening include an increasing number of men with localised disease and an increase in the number of well-differentiated tumours. However, the risk of overdiagnosis and subsequent over-treatment (due to the diagnosis of localised disease), using aggressive therapies fuels arguments against screening. Therefore, until more evidence is available proving otherwise, prostate cancer screening can only be justified in the context of clinical trials.},

Clinicopathologic features in patients with focal prostate carcinoma who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or who were treated with watchful waiting (WW) were analyzed to detect clinical predictors for disease progression during follow-up. Patients were selected from the European Randomized Screening study for Prostate Cancer. Focal carcinoma on sextant biopsy was defined as <or=3.0 mm involvement by tumor in 1 biopsy core lacking Gleason pattern 4 or 5. PSA doubling time was used in the WW group as a marker of disease progression. The proportion of patients with focal prostate carcinoma increased significantly from 16% in the first screening round to 29% in the second screening round. One hundred eighteen men underwent RP, and 108 men were treated with WW. The median tumor volume was 0.13 mL. PSA level and prostate volume were predictive for tumor volume in a multivariate regression analysis. A PSA density cut-off level of <or=0.1 ng/mL/cm3 predicted organ-confined tumor (<0.5 mL) in 94% of patients. Positive surgical margins were predictive for PSA recurrence. Four patients in the RP group had PSA recurrence at follow-up. PSA doubling times <2 years, <3 years, and <4 years were noted in 4.9%, 14.6%, and 22.0% of patients in the WW group, respectively. The median tumor volume was small (0.13 mL). A comparison between PSA recurrence in the RP group and PSA doubling time in the WW group showed a significantly more favorable outcome after RP if a PSA doubling time of <3 years or <4 years was chosen as a marker for disease progression in the WW group. A WW policy with delayed curative intent may be recommended in patients ages 55-75 years with focal carcinoma and PSA density <0.1 ng/mL/cm3.},

Sexual functioning and pelvic floor functioning were assessed using self-report questionnaires. In this cross-sectional study, a group of 89 young women aged 18-25 years who were victimized by rape in adolescence was compared with a group of 114 nonvictimized controls. The rape victims were treated for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 3 years prior to participation in the study. Three years posttreatment, rape victims were 2.4 times more likely to have a sexual dysfunction (lubrication problems and pain) and 2.7 times more likely to have pelvic floor dysfunction (symptoms of provoked vulvodynia, general stress, lower urinary tract, and irritable bowel syndrome) than nonvictimized controls. The relationship between rape and sexual problems was partially mediated by the presence of pelvic floor problems. Rape victims and controls did not differ with regard to sexual activities. Rape victims suffer significantly more from sexual dysfunction and pelvic floor dysfunction when compared with nontraumatized controls, despite the provision of treatment for PTSD. Possibly, physical manifestations of PTSD have been left unaddressed in treatment. Future treatment protocols should consider incorporating (physical or psychological) treatment strategies for sexual dysfunction and/or pelvic floor dysfunction into trauma exposure treatments.},

MAP, HR, SV, CI, SctO2, SptO2 and rate-pressure product (RPP) analysed from 30 s before drug administration until 240 s thereafter.

  abstract = {Low-field magnetic resonance imaging is currently developing into a valuable diagnostic tool due to its simplicity of magnet array designs. Particularly, this allows the development of scanners as part of educational workshops, thus ensuring knowledge transfer and empowering local scientists to design tailored solutions for specific local problems. To obtain the maximum performance, the magnet needs to be shimmed requiring an automated system measuring the spatial magnetic field distribution.

Eosinophilia was associated with shorter median length of stay in the eosinophilic groups(≥2% and ≥300 cell/microliter) compared to the non-eosinophilic groups. Early treatment failure was reduced in the both the eosinophilic groups (≥2% and ≥300 cell/microliter). Late treatment failure (day 11-30) did not differ between the groups. Relapse, was more frequent the eosinophilic groups (≥2% and ≥300 cell/microliter), however in the latter group this did not reach statistical significance. Eosinophilia ≥2% was a risk factor for having relapse (eosinophilia ≥2%: HR = 2·351; 95%CI 1·335-4·139), whereas eosinophilia <2% was associated with a lower risk factor for having early treatment failure (HR = 0·339 95%CI 0·122-0·943). We showed that blood eosinophilia at admission in patients with an AECOPD is associated with higher short-term treatment success rate.

Insulin signaling keeps FOXO/DAF-16 cytoplasmic, and hence transcriptionally inactive. Conversely, as in loss of insulin signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate FOXO/DAF-16 through nuclear accumulation. How ROS regulate the nuclear translocation of FOXO/DAF-16 is largely unknown. Cysteine oxidation can stabilize protein-protein interactions through the formation of disulfide-bridges when cells encounter ROS. Using a proteome-wide screen that identifies ROS-induced mixed disulfide-dependent complexes, we discovered several interaction partners of FOXO4, one of which is the nuclear import receptor transportin-1. We show that disulfide formation with transportin-1 is required for nuclear localization and the activation of FOXO4/DAF-16 induced by ROS, but not by the loss of insulin signaling. This molecular mechanism for nuclear shuttling is conserved in C. elegans and directly connects redox signaling to the longevity protein FOXO/DAF-16.},

The purpose of our study was to investigate the prevalence and associations of long-term CPAP adherence in first time users with mild sleep apnea diagnosed by home sleep apnea testing (HSAT). We identified all the patients who were diagnosed with mild sleep apnea (5 = < AHI < 15) by home sleep apnea testing from 01/2013 to 06/2019 at a large, combined community and hospital-based sleep practice. Only first time CPAP users were included. Compliance was defined as CPAP usage ≥ 4 h per night on ≥ 70% of nights over 30 consecutive days. We defined long term adherence as compliance on the 12th month following CPAP set up. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and CPAP compliance at 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th month after therapy initiation were collected. We compared and identified the factors that had significant difference (P < 0.1) between compliant and non-compliant groups at the 12th month. 222 patients were included in the analysis. 57 (25.7%) patients were adherent with long term CPAP treatment. The following factors were associated with a greater likelihood for long-term CPAP adherence: older age, lower body mass index (BMI), presence of a bed partner, non-smoker, presence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM), presence of Heart Failure (CHF), lack of depression, and compliance at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 9th month. Long term CPAP compliance in mild sleep apnea patients is low. Long term adherence to CPAP can be predicted based on CPAP adherence during the first three months.},

This article considers whether the incorporated aspects of physician-patient interaction have become similarly common across the globe by comparing the gestures that physicians use in their interactions with patients.

We explore how-in four university hospitals in Turkey, the People's Republic of China, The Netherlands and Germany-physicians use gesture in their discussions with simulated patients about the condition of heart failure. Our analysis confirms the importance of gestures for organising both the personal interaction and the knowledge transfer between physician and patient. From the perspective of global comparison, it is notable that physicians in all four hospitals used similar gestures. This demonstrates the globality of biomedical knowledge in an embodied mode. Physicians used gestures for a range of purposes, including to convey the idea of an 'anatomical map' and for constructing visual models of (patho-)physiological processes. Since biomedical language is rife with metaphor, it was not surprising that we also identified an accompanying metaphorical gesture which has a similar form in the various locations that were part of the study.},

A major obstacle of Flow-Diverters is the comparatively stiff microcatheter required for implantation. Consequentially, maneuverability is limited and primary catheterization of peripheral targets may be difficult or even futile in challenging vascular anatomies. To overcome this, a highly navigable microcatheter must be used to attain the desired vascular segment, followed by a hardly controllable exchange-maneuver via a long microwire, involving a high risk for wire-perforation. Our study aimed to investigate the value of low-profile stent-retrievers as a railway for introduction of the required microcatheter, which allows to maintain a stable endovascular position and reduce the risk for procedural vessel injury. 14cases (8females, mean-age 59y) of Flow-Diverter-Implantation requiring the use of a low-profile stent-retriever were reviewed. All cases featured a challenging vascular anatomy. After micro-catheterization of the desired segment, the stent-retriever was carefully deployed as an anchor in a secure, distal location. In all cases a pREset/LITE-stent-retriever was used for introduction of the equipment required for implantation. In all cases the anchoring-maneuver was performed without technical complications. The stent-retrievers maintained a stable position after deployment in all situations. No potential traumatic sudden movements of the microcatheter occurred. No procedure-related perforations, dissections or vasospasms were observable during the interventions or their aftermath.

All had a PSA value between 4 and 10 ng/ml prior to diagnosis. Minimal prostate cancer is defined as organ confined, Gleason score </=6 (no Gleason grade 4 or 5), and tumour volume <0.5 ml. Sera and tumour volumes from 91 men were available for analysis. Minimal prostate cancer was diagnosed in 16.5% of the selected cases. Mean tumour volume was 1.2 ml (range: 0.04-13.5); hK2, the algorithms hK2/fPSA, and hK2/%fPSA have significant correlations with tumour volume. Both algorithms also yielded the best test results in predicting minimal disease with an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 82%. hK2 and percent free PSA have added prognostic value for the detection of minimal prostate cancer in screen-detected cases within PSA range 4-10 ng/ml.

The obtained histochemical and immunohistochemical results over three time points (10, 30, and 60 days) showed that the tissue response to the sugar crosslinked collagen membrane involves inflammatory macrophages in a comparable manner to the macrophages observed in the surrounding tissue of the control collagen-based membranes, which were proven as biocompatible. The tissue reactions to the barrier membranes were additionally compared to wounds from a sham operation. Results suggest wound healing properties of all the investigated barrier membranes. However, the sugar-crosslinked membrane lacked in cellular infiltration and transmembraneous vascularization, providing an exclusive barrier function in GBR. Moreover, this membrane maintained a similar swelling ratio over examined timepoints, which suggests a very slow degradation pattern and supports its barrier function. Based on the study results, which showed biocompatibility of the sugar crosslinked membrane and its stability up to 60 days post-implantation, it can be concluded that this membrane may be suitable for application in GBR as a biomaterial with exclusive barrier functionality, similar to non-resorbable options.},

  abstract = {Portopulmonary hypertension (POPH), a complication of chronic liver disease, may be a contraindication to liver transplantation (LT) because of the elevated risk of peritransplant and posttransplant morbidity and mortality. Because POPH is frequently asymptomatic, screening with echocardiography is recommended. The only reliable technique, however, for diagnosing POPH is right heart catheterization (RHC). The aims of this study were to evaluate the current estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) cutoff value of 30 mm Hg and to determine a better cutoff value. One hundred fifty-two patients underwent pretransplant echocardiography between January 2005 and December 2010. These echocardiographic results were compared with pulmonary artery pressures measured during the pretransplant workup or at the beginning of the transplantation procedure (both by catheterization). With a cutoff value of 30 mm Hg, 74 of the 152 patients met the criteria for POPH on echocardiography, although the diagnosis was confirmed in only 7 patients during catheterization; this resulted in a specificity of 54%. It would have been more accurate to use a cutoff value of 38 mm Hg, which had a maximal specificity of 82% and, at the same time, guaranteed a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%. With the incorporation of the presence or absence of right ventricular dilatation, the specificity even increased to 93% for this new cutoff value. In conclusion, the prevalence of POPH was 4.6% among LT candidates in this study. We can recommend that LT candidates with an sPAP > 38 mm Hg should be referred for RHC. With the cutoff value increased from 30 to 38 mm Hg, the number of patients undergoing invasive RHC during their evaluation could be safely reduced.},

To extend the efficacy of CAR T cells, we develop a CAR enhancer (CAR-E), comprising a CAR T cell antigen fused to an immunomodulatory molecule. Here we demonstrate this strategy using B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR T cells for the treatment of multiple myeloma, with a CAR-E consisting of the BCMA fused to a low-affinity interleukin 2 (IL-2). This selectively induces IL-2 signaling in CAR T cells upon antigen-CAR binding, enhancing T cell activation and antitumor activity while reducing IL-2-associated toxicities. We show that the BCMA CAR-E selectively binds CAR T cells and increases CAR T cell proliferation, clearance of tumor cells and development of memory CAR T cells. The memory cells retain the ability to re-expand upon restimulation, effectively controlling tumor growth upon rechallenge. Mechanistic studies reveal the involvement of both CAR and IL-2 receptor endodomains in the CAR-E mechanism of action. The CAR-E approach avoids the need for specific engineering and enables CAR T cell therapy with lower cell doses.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation of obesity with total shoulder arthroplasty outcomes using data from the New Zealand Joint Registry (NZJR). This study used data collected from the NZJR for patients undergoing primary aTSA and rTSA between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2022, who had body mass index (BMI) data recorded. In the study, 5628 shoulders were included, including 1696 aTSAs and 3932 rTSAs. The primary outcome measure was all-cause revision rate (rate/100 component years) stratified by BMI class. Secondary outcome measures included the Oxford Shoulder Score. The overall risk of revision for all shoulders was 1.01 for aTSA (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-1.26) and 0.70 for rTSA (95% CI 0.57-0.86). The risk of all-cause revision did not increase with increasing BMI class in either the aTSA or rTSA group. Among those who had aTSA, those with class II/III obesity had the lowest revision rate of 0.77 (95% CI 0.39-1.28). Among those who had rTSA, risk of revision remained low among all BMI groups with class II/III obese patients showing a nonsignificant trend toward higher risk of revision (adjusted hazard ratio 1.61 [95% CI 0.81-3.23]). There was no association between elevated BMI and risk for deep infection. There was no association between Oxford Shoulder Score and BMI. The results from the NZJR support the continued use of aTSA and reverse shoulder arthroplasty in the obese population. Obesity was not found to be an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in shoulder arthroplasty in our study.},

We carried out a scale-up study, using a 200-L orbitally-shaken bioreactor holding disposable bags, and BY-2 cells producing the human monoclonal antibody M12. We found that cell growth and recombinant protein accumulation were comparable to standard shake flask cultivation, despite a 200-fold difference in cultivation volume. Final cell fresh weights of 300-387 g/L and M12 yields of ∼20 mg/L were achieved with both cultivation methods. Furthermore, we established an efficient downstream process for the recovery of M12 from the culture broth. The viscous spent medium prevented clarification using filtration devices, but we used expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography with SP Sepharose as an alternative for the efficient capture of the M12 antibody. EBA was introduced as an initial purification step prior to protein A affinity chromatography, resulting in an overall M12 recovery of 75-85% and a purity of >95%. Our results demonstrate the suitability of orbitally-shaken bioreactors for the scaled-up cultivation of plant cell suspension cultures and provide a strategy for the efficient purification of antibodies from the BY-2 culture medium.},

To model OPMD in a myogenic and physiological context, we generated mouse myoblast cell clones stably expressing either human wild type (WT) or expPABPN1 at low levels. Transgene expression is induced on myotube differentiation and results in formation of insoluble nuclear PABPN1 aggregates that are similar to those observed in patients with OPMD. Quantitative analysis of PABPN1 in myotube cultures revealed that expPABPN1 accumulation and aggregation is greater than that of the WT protein. We found that aggregation of expPABPN1 is more affected than WT PABPN1 by inhibition of proteasome activity. Consistent with this, in myotube cultures expressing expPABPN1, deregulation of the proteasome was identified as the most significantly perturbed pathway. Differences in the accumulation of soluble WT and expPABPN1 were consistent with differences in ubiquitination and rate of protein turnover. This study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, that, in myotubes, the ratio of soluble/insoluble expPABPN1 is significantly lower compared with that of the WT protein. We suggest that this difference can contribute to muscle weakness in OPMD.},

The molecular regulation of this process is not fully understood. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), an expansion of an alanine tract at the N-terminus of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) causes muscle symptoms. OPMD patient muscle degeneration initiates after midlife, while at an earlier age carriers of alanine expansion mutant PABPN1 (expPABPN1) are clinically pre-symptomatic. OPMD is characterized by fibrosis in skeletal muscles but the causative molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We studied the molecular processes that are involved in OPMD pathology using cross-species mRNA expression profiles in muscles from patients and model systems. We identified significant dysregulation of the ECM functional group, among which the procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 1 gene (PCOLCE) was consistently down-regulated across species. We investigated PCOLCE subcellular localization in OPMD muscle samples and OPMD model systems to investigate any functional relevance of PCOLCE down-regulation in this disease. We found that muscle degeneration in OPMD is associated with PCOLCE down-regulation. In addition to its known presence at the ECM, we also found PCOLCE within the nucleus of muscle cells. PCOLCE sub-cellular localization changes during myoblast cell fusion and is disrupted in cells expressing mutant expPABPN1. Our results show that PCOLCE binds to soluble PABPN1 and co-localizes with aggregated PABPN1 with a preference for the mutant protein. In muscle biopsies from OPMD patients we find that extracellular PCOLCE is depleted with its concomitant enrichment within the nuclear compartment. PCOLCE regulates collagen processing at the ECM. Depletion of extracellular PCOLCE is associated with the expression of expPABPN1 in OPMD patient muscles. PCOLCE is also localized within the nucleus where it binds to PABPN1, suggesting that PCOLCE shuttles between the ECM and the nucleus. PCOLCE preferentially binds to expPABPN1. Nuclear-localized PCOLCE is enriched in muscle cells expressing expPABPN1. We suggest that nuclear entrapment of PCOLCE and its extracellular depletion represents a novel molecular mechanism in late-onset muscle fibrosis.},

We also compared estrous activity between estrous events with or without conception and determined the effect of genetic merit for fertility traits on age and BW at time of first detected estrous activity event. Activity monitoring devices (Heatime, SCR-Engineers) were fitted to Holstein-Friesian heifers aged 7 to 9 mo with positive or negative genetic merit for fertility traits (POS FertBV: average +5%, n = 275; NEG FertBV: average -5%, n = 249) and activity data were collected to the end of the first breeding period (15-17 mo). An estrous event was defined as when the activity change index exceeded 19.2 activity units (AU) for ≥6 consecutive hours. In total, 2,434 estrous events were identified (POS FertBV: n = 1,454; NEG FertBV: n = 980). Estrous event duration was defined as the period when the threshold was first exceeded and when activity dropped below threshold, without another event starting within 24 h of the end of the previous event. This definition included occurrences where activity crossed the threshold multiple times in a day; these were classified as a single estrous event. A second measure, high activity duration, was defined as the total time activity exceeded the threshold. To characterize estrous activity, baseline activity was determined from the previous 7 d of activity. Peak activity and total activity (area under the curve of activity above baseline) were calculated. A fifth variable, interestrous interval, was calculated as a proxy for estrous cycle length. Total activity and peak activity were greater in POS than NEG FertBV heifers (total activity: 548 vs. 464 AU, SED = 19.6 AU; peak activity: 72 vs. 65 AU, SE of the difference [SED] = 1.5 AU). The POS FertBV group had a mean estrous event duration and high activity duration of 15.1 and 15.0 h, compared with 14.1 and 14.1 h for the NEG FertBV group (SED = 0.30 and 0.29 h, respectively). Inter-estrous interval did not differ between POS FertBV and NEG FertBV heifers (19.5 vs. 20.0 d, SED = 0.49). Estrous events associated with conception were shorter than those not associated with conception (mean ± SEM, high activity duration: 13.0 ± 0.25 h vs. 13.9 ± 0.31 h, estrous event duration: 13.1 ± 0.25 h vs. 14 ± 0.32 h) and had less total activity (408 ± 15.2 vs. 487 ± 18.2 AU). The POS FertBV heifers were more likely to have their first estrous activity event than NEG FertBV heifers by a given age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.0-1.6) or BW (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.1-1.6). The outcomes of this study provide evidence that positive genetic merit for fertility traits is associated with more overt estrous expression. Therefore, estrous expression traits may have potential to be used as earlier-in-life predictors of genetic merit for fertility.},

  abstract = {Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a monogenic disorder characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). A FH causing genetic variant in LDLR, APOB, or PCSK9 is not identified in 12-60% of clinical FH patients (FH mutation-negative patients). We aimed to assess whether altered DNA methylation might be associated with FH in this latter group. In this study we included 78 FH mutation-negative patients and 58 FH mutation-positive patients with a pathogenic LDLR variant. All patients were male, not using lipid lowering therapies and had LDL-C levels >6 mmol/L and triglyceride levels <3.5 mmol/L. DNA methylation was measured with the Infinium Methylation EPIC 850 K beadchip assay. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to explore DNA methylation differences between the two groups in genes related to lipid metabolism. A gradient boosting machine learning model was applied to investigate accumulated genome-wide differences between the two groups. Candidate gene analysis revealed one significantly hypomethylated CpG site in CPT1A (cg00574958) in FH mutation-negative patients, while no differences in methylation in other lipid genes were observed. The machine learning model did distinguish the two groups with a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC)±SD of 0.80±0.17 and provided two CpG sites (cg26426080 and cg11478607) in genes with a possible link to lipid metabolism (PRDM16 and GSTT1). FH mutation-negative patients are characterized by accumulated genome wide DNA methylation differences, but not by major DNA methylation alterations in known lipid genes compared to FH mutation-positive patients.

  abstract = {An adjuvant is a chemical incorporated into vaccines that enhances their efficacy by improving the immune response. Identifying adjuvant names from cancer vaccine studies is essential for furthering research and enhancing immunotherapies. However, the manual curation from the constantly expanding biomedical literature poses significant challenges. This study explores the automated recognition of vaccine adjuvant names using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) and Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama). We utilized two datasets: 97 clinical trial records from AdjuvareDB and 290 PubMed abstracts annotated with the Vaccine Adjuvant Compendium (VAC). Two LLMs, GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 were employed in zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms with up to four examples per prompt. Prompts explicitly targeted adjuvant names, testing the impact of contextual information such as substances or interventions. Outputs underwent automated and manual validation for accuracy and consistency. GPT-4o consistently attained 100% Precision across all situations, while also exhibiting notable enhancements in Recall and F1-scores, particularly with the incorporation of interventions. On the VAC dataset, GPT-4o achieved a maximum F1-score of 77.32% with interventions, surpassing Llama-3.2-3B by approximately 2%. On the AdjuvareDB dataset, GPT-4o reached an F1-score of 81.67% for three-shot prompting with interventions, surpassing Llama-3.2-3B's maximum F1-score of 65.62%. These results highlight the critical role of contextual information in enhancing model performance, with GPT-4o demonstrating a superior ability to leverage this enrichment. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at accurately identifying adjuvant names, including rare and novel variations of naming representation. This study emphasizes the capability of LLMs to enhance cancer vaccine development by efficiently extracting insights from clinical trial data. Future work aims to broaden the framework to encompass a wider array of biomedical literature and enhance model generalizability across various vaccines and adjuvants.

The aim of this study was to assess whether the Dutch version of the US Pediatric Symptom checklist (PSC) is valid and suitable for the early detection of psychosocial problems among children. We included 687 children (response 84.3%) aged 7-12 undergoing routine health assessments in nine Preventive Child Health Services across the Netherlands. Child health professionals interviewed and examined children and parents. Before the interview, parents completed an authorised Dutch translation of the PSC and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). The CBCL and data on the child's current treatment status were used as criteria for the validity of the PSC. The consistency of the Dutch PSC was good (Cronbach alpha 0.89). The area under the ROC curve using the CBCL as a criterion was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 0.96). At the US cut-off (28 and above), the prevalence rate of an increased score and sensitivity were lower than in the USA. At a lower cut-off (22 and above), sensitivity and specificity were similar to that of the US version (71.7% and 93.0% respectively). Information on the PSC also helped in the identification of children with elevated CBCL Total Problems Scores, above solely clinical judgment. The PSC is also useful for the early detection of psychosocial problems in preventive child healthcare outside the USA, especially with an adjusted cut-off.},

  abstract = {In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic broke out. The virus rapidly spread globally, resulting in a major world public-health crisis. The major disease manifestation occurs in the respiratory tract. However, further studies documented other systemic involvement. This study investigates histopathologic eye changes in postmortem material of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded eyes from 5 patients (10 eyes) who died of COVID-19 at the University Hospital in Basel were included. Gross examination and histological evaluation were performed by 3 independent ophthalmopathologists. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using antibodies against fibrin, cleaved caspase 3, and ACE-2. Five enucleated eyes of patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2 served as control group. All cases have been studied for presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by means of reverse transcription PCR and RNA in situ hybridization (ISH). The choroidal vessels of one case were analyzed with electron microscope. Ophthalmopathologically, 8 eyes from 4 patients displayed swollen endothelial cells in congested choroidal vessels. No further evidence of specific eye involvement of SARS-CoV-2 was found in any of the patients. In the 8 eyes with evidence of changes due to SARS-CoV-2, immunohistochemical staining demonstrated fibrin microthrombi, apoptotic changes of endothelial and inflammatory cells. In control eyes, ACE-2 was detectable in the conjunctiva, cornea, retina, and choroidea and displayed significantly lower amounts of stained cells as in COVID-19 eyes. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in both bulbi of 2/5 patients, yet ISH failed to visualize viruses. Electron microscopy showed no significant results due to the artifacts. As already described in other organs of COVID-19 patients, the ophthalmological examination revealed-microthrombi, that is, hypercoagulation and vasculopathy most probably due to endothelial damage. A possible viral spread to the endothelial cells via ACE-2 provides one pathophysiological explanation. The expression of ACE-2 receptors in the conjunctiva hints toward its susceptibility to infection. To what extend eyes, function is disrupted by SARS-CoV-2 is subject to further studies, especially in the clinic.},

Barrier membranes play an important role in this process by preventing soft tissue invasion outgoing from the mucosa and creating an underlying space to support bone growth. Different membrane types provide different biological mechanisms due to their different origins, preparation methods and structures. Among them, collagen membranes have attracted great interest due to their excellent biological properties and desired bone regeneration results to non-absorbable membranes even without a second surgery for removal. This work provides a comparative summary of common barrier membranes used in GBR, focusing on recent advances in collagen membranes and their biological mechanisms. In conclusion, the review article highlights the biological and regenerative properties of currently available barrier membranes with a particular focus on bioresorbable collagen-based materials. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of these biomaterials are highlighted, and possible improvements for future material developments are summarized.},

High doses of gas emergence are reported to impair osseointegration and may therefore lead to fixation failure. The successful delay and reduction of the degradation rate by applying plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) as a post processing surface modification method for magnesium alloy has recently been demonstrated. The aim of this study was thus to compare the degradation behavior of a WE43-based plate system with and without respective PEO surface modification and to further investigate osseointegration, as well as the resulting effects on the surrounding bony tissue of both variants in a miniature pig model. WE43 magnesium screws and plates without (WE43) and with PEO surface modification (WE43-PEO) were implanted in long bones of Göttingen Miniature Pigs. At six and twelve months after surgery, micro-CT and histomorphometric analysis was performed.

At last follow-up of 5.9 ± 3,13 years, 2 children died (4 %) and 37 (76 %) children presented with poor neurological outcome with epilepsy (57 %), intellectual disability (51 %) and language disorders (47 %). Rehabilitation was necessary for 76 % and 59 % had abnormal academic performances. At onset, younger age and seizures were significantly associated to language disorders (p < 0.01), motor disabilities (p = 0.01), and intellectual disabilities (p = 0.01) in univariate analysis. Abnormal MRIs were more frequent in children with neurological sequalae (p = 0.01). Multivariate analyses identified that: (1) epilepsy occurred more frequently in females (p = 0.03), with insular lesions (p = 0.048); (2) language disorders were more common in children who had seizures at onset (p 0.02); (3) motor disorders were more frequent in younger children (p = 0.03) with thalamic lesions (p = 0.04). Our findings indicate that despite decrease in mortality rates, neurological disabilities in children with HSVE still persist at high levels. This underscores the need to enhance HSVE management strategies.

We define RBPs in healthy and diseased cardiomyocytes at a system-wide level by RNA interactome capture. This identifies 67 cardiomyocyte-specific RBPs, including several contractile proteins. Furthermore, we identify the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 4 (Cpeb4) as a dynamic RBP, regulating cardiac growth both in vitro and in vivo. We identify mRNAs bound to and regulated by Cpeb4 in cardiomyocytes. Cpeb4 regulates cardiac remodeling by differential expression of transcription factors. Among Cpeb4 target mRNAs, two zinc finger transcription factors (Zeb1 and Zbtb20) are discovered. We show that Cpeb4 regulates the expression of these mRNAs and that Cpeb4 depletion increases their expression. Thus, Cpeb4 emerges as a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte function by differential binding to specific mRNAs in response to pathological growth stimulation.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate predisposing factors and prognosis of NODID RSIE compared to other RSIE forms. A retrospective cohort study (January 2008-January 2019) was conducted in a reference center on 300 patients diagnosed with IE. Endocarditis-related events were defined as related to IE in mortality or open-heart surgery during follow-up. A review and meta-analysis of associated literature (January 2008-January 2019) were also performed. Fifty-seven patients presented RSIE (19%), 22 of which were NODID RSIE (39%). Use of intravascular catheters (23% vs 3%; p = 0.027) and congenital heart diseases (18% vs 0%; p = 0.019) were associated with NODID RSIE. This group had a higher in-hospital mortality (23% vs 3%; p = 0.027) and endocarditis-related event rates (41% vs 6%; p = 0.001) than non-NODID RSIE. Furthermore, NODID RSIE was independently associated with in-hospital endocarditis-related events (OR = 19.29; 95%CI:2.23-167.16; p = 0.007). Our meta-analysis evaluated four studies and identified 96 cases (30%) of NODID RSIE from 320 total RSIE cases. NODID RSIE patients demonstrated higher in-hospital mortality (RR = 2.81; 95%CI:1.61-4.90; p < 0.001; I},

We provide a systematic review of the recent literature on comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with eating disorders, and focus on prevalence, relationship with symptom severity, operating mechanisms and treatment. The prevalence of comorbid PTSD in patients with eating disorders ranges from 9 to 24%, with research suggesting that comorbid PTSD is associated with more severe eating disorder symptoms. Maladaptive emotional regulation strategies may mediate the relationship between PTSD and eating disorders. Two pilot studies provide preliminary evidence that concurrent cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for PTSD and eating disorders may be beneficial and that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could be helpful in the treatment of PTSD in some eating disorder patients. PTSD is a common comorbidity in patients with eating disorders and impacts the severity of their eating disorder symptoms. However, there is little research into concurrent treatments for PTSD and eating disorders. Difficulties in emotional regulation may be a common mechanism in both disorders.},

Improved sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) function with enhanced Ca(2+) resequestration appears critical for S100A1's cyclic adenosine monophosphate-independent inotropic effects but raises concerns about potential diastolic SR Ca(2+) leakage that might trigger fatal arrhythmias. This study shows for the first time a diminished interaction between S100A1 and ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) in experimental HF. Restoring this link in failing cardiomyocytes, engineered heart tissue and mouse hearts, respectively, by means of adenoviral and adeno-associated viral S100A1 cDNA delivery normalizes diastolic RyR2 function and protects against Ca(2+)- and β-adrenergic receptor-triggered proarrhythmogenic SR Ca(2+) leakage in vitro and in vivo. S100A1 inhibits diastolic SR Ca(2+) leakage despite aberrant RyR2 phosphorylation via protein kinase A and calmodulin-dependent kinase II and stoichiometry with accessory modulators such as calmodulin, FKBP12.6 or sorcin. Our findings demonstrate that S100A1 is a regulator of diastolic RyR2 activity and beneficially modulates diastolic RyR2 dysfunction. S100A1 interaction with the RyR2 is sufficient to protect against basal and catecholamine-triggered arrhythmic SR Ca(2+) leak in HF, combining antiarrhythmic potency with chronic inotropic actions.},

Our knowledge about which prostate cancers are life threatening and which are not is limited. Thus, for ethical, medical, and economic reasons we need to define which patients can be managed by active surveillance. From 1993 through 1999, men from the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) were screened by two strict protocols, which were based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination, and transrectal ultrasound. For this study, men with criteria that reflect current active surveillance studies were selected: those with a biopsy Gleason score < or =3+3 in two or fewer cores, with a PSA density <0.2 and a maximum PSA-level of 15 ng/ml. Clinical stage had to be T1C or T2. Of the 1,014 prostate cancers detected in the prevalence screen, 293 men (28.9%) met the criteria for active surveillance. Their mean age was 65.7 and the mean PSA level was 4.8 ng/ml. Radical prostatectomy was elected by 136 men (46.4%), radiotherapy by 91 (31.1%), and watchful waiting by 64 (21.8%). The mean follow-up was 80.8 months. The eight-year prostate cancer-specific survival was 99.2%; the overall survival was 85.4%. Nineteen men who chose watchful waiting changed to definitive treatment during follow-up. Only three men died of prostate cancer, none of whom were on watchful waiting. Our observations provide preliminary validation of the arbitrary selection criteria for active surveillance.},

Each of 36 athletes with shoulder pain aggravated by abduction and external rotation was examined in a single visit during which conventional radiography, arthrography, CT arthrography, and MR arthrography were performed. In 17 of these athletes, imaging findings were compared with those at arthroscopy. All images were independently evaluated by two groups of musculoskeletal radiologists. Structures found to be affected were, in decreasing order of frequency, the following: the posterosuperior labrum, supraspinatus tendon, infraspinatus tendon, humeral head, glenoid cavity and rim, acromioclavicular joint, anteroinferior capsulolabral complex, biceps tendon, and subscapularis tendon. MR arthrography without and with abduction and external rotation yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity for all lesions with the exceptions of bone sclerosis and enthesophytes (which were best seen with CT arthrography). MR arthrography with abduction and external rotation was most accurate for diagnosis of rotator cuff and anteroinferior capsulolabral complex tears. On the basis of these preliminary results, we believe that MR arthrography with abduction and external rotation should be part of the imaging evaluation of shoulder pain in throwing athletes, owing to the high sensitivity of this imaging technique.},

Patients with acute MI showed significantly increased S100A1 serum levels. Experimental MI in mice induced comparable S100A1 release. S100A1 internalization was observed in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) adjacent to damaged cardiomyocytes. In vitro analyses revealed exclusive S100A1 endocytosis by CFs, followed by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent activation of MAP kinases and NF-κB. CFs exposed to S100A1 assumed an immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic phenotype characterized i.e. by enhanced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) and decreased collagen levels. In mice, intracardiac S100A1 injection recapitulated these transcriptional changes. Moreover, antibody-mediated neutralization of S100A1 enlarged infarct size and worsened left ventricular functional performance post-MI. Our study demonstrates alarmin properties for S100A1 from necrotic cardiomyocytes. However, the potentially beneficial role of extracellular S100A1 in MI-related inflammation and repair warrants further investigation.},

A retrospective cohort study including all patients with critical limb ischemia aged ≥65 undergoing surgical or endovascular treatment for critical limb ischemia between January 2013 and June 2018 was conducted. Data on adverse cardiac events were collected from medical records. The effect of an adverse cardiac event on mortality during 6 months follow-up was analyzed with a multivariable cox proportional hazards model to adjust for confounders. Effects are displayed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total number of 449 patients were included. Median age was 76 years, 52.8% of patients were male. In total, 51 patients (11%) developed an adverse cardiac event, 31 patients (10%) in the surgical group and 20 patients (14%) in the endovascular group. After adjustment for confounders, adverse cardiac events were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 3.5 95% CI 2.1-5.9). This study showed that adverse cardiac events commonly occur in elderly patients with critical limb ischemia. Adverse cardiac events continue to occur even months after treatment and are associated with an increased mortality risk. These findings justify routine cardiac evaluation in both surgical and endovascular treatment. Additionally, frequent postdischarge cardiac follow-up in the outpatient clinic may be helpful in limiting the occurrence of adverse cardiac events.},

We optimized protocols for the production of deuterated functionally active thermostable dimeric Lac repressor and its core domain mutants. The Lac repressor core domain has never been obtained as a recombinant protein, possibly due to the observed toxicity to the host cells. We overcame the core domain induced toxicity by co-expression of this domain with the full length Lac repressor, combined with a stringent control of culture conditions. Significant overexpression was only obtained if during all stages of pre-culturing the bacteria were kept in their exponential growth phase at low density. The sensitivity of NMR measurements is dramatically affected by buffer conditions; we therefore used a thermofluor buffer optimization screen to determine the optimal buffer conditions. The combined thermofluor and NMR screening method yielded thermostable fully functional Lac repressor domain samples suitable for high-resolution NMR studies. The optimized procedures to adapt Escherichia coli to growth in D2O, to overcome toxicity, and to optimize protein sample conditions provides a broad range of universally applicable techniques for production of larger proteins for NMR spectroscopy.},

In 12 patients with mild to moderate forms of Alzheimer's disease and 10 elderly control volunteers, activation of the MTL memory system was studied. We used two learning tasks that required the encoding of new information into memory. After the functional MR imaging experiment, participants were tested for recognition of the encoded objects. In the elderly control volunteers, activation during memory encoding was observed in medial and lateral temporal lobe structures (fusiform, parietal and occipital parts, and hippocampal formation) and in the frontal cortex, as reported previously in studies of young control volunteers. Focusing on the MTL, we observed that activation was significantly decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with control volunteers in the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally during the first encoding task but not during the second (P < .05, uncorrected). Functional MR imaging with a learning task seems feasible in elderly volunteers and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The measured functional signal decrease in MTL areas warrants further exploration of the (early) diagnostic usefulness of functional MR imaging in cases of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.},

Ocular dominance was determined by means of the near-far alignment test. fMRI-measurements consisted of a double-slice gradient echo sequence. Slices were acquired placed parallel on either side of the calcarine fissure. Visual stimulation was done with goggles with two LED matrices (red light, 8 Hz); each in front of one eye. In each subject, the left and right eye were stimulated separately and together, in a randomly alternating order. Twenty-two subjects showed activation, of whom eight subjects had a dominant left eye and 14 a dominant right eye. In general the size of the activated area was bigger upon stimulation of the dominant eye. The difference with the area upon stimulation of the non-dominant eye was statistically significant in the right eye dominant group. These results indicate that the dominant eye actually activates a larger area of the primary visual cortex than the non-dominant eye. This provides for the first time a functional basis for the concept of ocular dominance.},

A reproducibility ratio for size (R[size]) and for location (R[overlap]) was calculated on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. Activation was seen in 89% of the subjects. The size of the activated area was widely variable among subjects: mean, 460 +/- 284 mm2; range, 0 to 1029 mm2 in the first study in all volunteers. Signal increases ranged from 3.2% to 10.9%, with a mean of 6.6 +/- 1.7%. The mean values of intrasubject variability testing were R(size) = 0.83 +/- 0.16 and R(overlap) = 0.31 +/- 0.11. Functional MR imaging with the FLASH technique is useful in identifying certain cortical areas that have quite variable locations among subjects. This study provides reference data for the intrasubject and intersubject variability of the activation pattern of the visual cortex.},

  abstract = {A number of functional brain imaging studies indicate that the medial temporal lobe system is crucially involved in encoding new information into memory. However, most studies were based on differences in brain activity between encoding of familiar vs. novel stimuli. To further study the underlying cognitive processes, we applied a parametric design of encoding. Seven healthy subjects were instructed to encode complex color pictures into memory. Stimuli were presented in a parametric fashion at different rates, thus representing different loads of encoding. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess changes in brain activation. To determine the number of pictures successfully stored into memory, recognition scores were determined afterwards. During encoding, brain activation occurred in the medial temporal lobe, comparable to the results obtained by others. Increasing the encoding load resulted in an increase in the number of successfully stored items. This was reflected in a significant increase in brain activation in the left lingual gyrus, in the left and right parahippocampal gyrus, and in the right inferior frontal gyrus. This study shows that fMRI can detect changes in brain activation during variation of one aspect of higher cognitive tasks. Further, it strongly supports the notion that the human medial temporal lobe is involved in encoding novel visual information into memory.},

Since cell behavior is simultaneously affected by the physical, chemical, and structural properties of the gel network, microgels with variable morphology but chemical equivalence are of interest. This work describes a new method to produce thermoresponsive microgels with defined mechanical properties, surface morphologies, and volume phase transition temperatures. A wide variety of microgels is synthesized by crosslinking monomers or star polymers at different temperatures using thermally assisted microfluidics. The diversification of microgels with different network structures and morphologies but of chemical equivalence offers a new platform of microgel building blocks with the ability to undergo phase transition at physiological temperatures. The method holds high potential to create soft and dynamic materials while maintaining the chemical composition for a wide variety of applications in biomedicine.},

General anaesthesia is the recommended method of sedation during these procedures. However, this patient population is at an increased risk of anaesthetic complications, and the best approach to general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation is unknown. The aims of this study were to describe the anaesthetic management techniques used during bronchoscopic lung volume reduction procedures and to investigate the number of anaesthesia-related events. Data were retrospectively collected from all endobronchial valve and lung volume reduction coil procedures performed between January 2018 and March 2020 in our hospital. Primary outcomes measures were anaesthetic technique including airway management; ventilation mode and settings; and the incidence of anaesthesia-related events, classified as catastrophic, severe, significant, or moderate. 202 procedures were included. One procedure was performed under procedural sedation, 198 (98%) under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation, and 3 (1.5%) under general anaesthesia with laryngeal mask airway. Volume-controlled ventilation was used in 64% of the procedures and pressure-controlled in 36%. Patients were ventilated with a median respiration rate of 9.9 (IQR: 9.6-10.6) breaths per minute, mean tidal volume of 5.8 ± 1.4 mL/kg, and median inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2.8 (IQR: 1:2.1-1:3.2). No catastrophic anaesthesia-related events were observed. Hypotension was the most observed anaesthesia-related event. Despite the presence of advanced COPD, general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation are well tolerated by patients undergoing endobronchial valve or lung volume reduction coil treatment. This is presumably strongly linked to the strict selection criteria. Other important considerations are using a low respiratory rate, low tidal volume, and high I:E ratio.},

The data set consisted of 79 fractures from 64 elephants (including Asian and African males and females), 44.3% of which were Class III fractures with pulpal involvement. Of this subset, pulp canal exposures of >0.5 cm were 23.8-fold more likely to develop pulpitis than fractures with <0.5 cm exposed, though canal size did not impact healing versus extraction outcome. Odds ratios showed that treatments including endodontics were 12.0-fold more likely to heal than tusks treated exclusively with medical management, though no association was observed in reducing the risk of pulpitis. Further, pulpitis was 7.58-fold more likely to develop when tap water was used to rinse exposed pulpal tissue; a finding that merits further investigation. The use of endodontic treatment versus medical management alone was significantly associated with improved recovery outcomes (i.e., reduced risk of extraction) in tusk fractures with pulpal involvement.},

  abstract = {Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by a chronic inflammatory process involving multiple cytokine pathways, leading to articular cartilage degeneration. Intra-articular therapies using pharmaceutical or autologous anti-inflammatory factors offer potential non-surgical treatment options. Autologous protein solution (APS) is one such product that uses the patient's blood to produce a concentrate of cells and anti-inflammatory cytokines. This study evaluated the effect of a specific APS intra-articular injection (nSTRIDE) on patient-reported outcome measures compared to saline in moderate knee OA. A parallel, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial was conducted, where patients with unilateral moderate knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3) received either nSTRIDE or saline (placebo) injection to their symptomatic knee. The primary outcome was the difference in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score at 12 months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included WOMAC component scores, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at all follow-up timepoints (three, six, and 12 months). A total of 40 patients were analyzed (21 nSTRIDE; 19 saline) in the study. No significant difference was found between nSTRIDE and saline groups for WOMAC total score at 12 months (mean difference -10.4 (95% CI -24.4 to 3.6; p = 0.141). There were no significant differences in WOMAC or KOOS scores across all timepoints. VAS scores favoured the saline group for both rest and worst pain scales at 12 months post-injection (mean difference (worst) 12 months 21.5 (95% CI 6.2 to 36.8; p = 0.008); mean difference (rest) 12 months 17.8 (95% CI 2.2 to 33.4; p = 0.026)). There were no adverse events recorded in either study group. Our study demonstrates no significant differences between nSTRIDE and saline groups in KOOS and WOMAC scores over time. Notably, APS injection resulted in significantly worse pain symptoms at 12 months compared to saline injection.},

To assess CGM metrics for glycemic variation and glycemic control in adult patients with GSDIa as compared to matched healthy volunteers. Prospective CGM data were collected during the ENGLUPRO GSDIa trial (NCT04311307) in which a Dexcom G6 device was used. Ten adult patients with GSDIa and 10 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled. Capillary blood glucose was concurrently measured during 2 standardized 2-hour time intervals. Descriptive [eg, glycemic variability (GV), time below range, time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR)] and advanced (ie, first- and second-order derivatives, Fourier analysis) CGM outcomes were calculated. For each descriptive CGM outcome measure, 95% CIs were computed in patients with GSDIa and healthy volunteers, respectively. CGM overestimation was higher under preprandial and level 1 hypoglycemia (ie, capillary glucose values ≥ 3.0 mmol/L and < 3.9 mmol/L) conditions. GV and TAR were higher while TIR was lower in patients with GSDIa compared to healthy volunteers (P < 0.05). Three patients with GSDIa showed descriptive CGM outcomes outside the calculated 95% CI in GSDIa patients. Advanced CGM analysis revealed a distinct pattern (ie, first- and second-order derivatives and glucose curve amplitude) in each of these 3 patients within the patients group. This is the first study to prospectively compare CGM outcomes between adult patients with GSDIa and matched healthy volunteers. The generation of a set of CGM metrics will provide guidance in using and interpreting CGM data in GSDIa and will be useful for the definition of glycemic targets for CGM in patients with GSDIa. Future studies should investigate the prognostic value of CGM outcomes and their major determinants in patients with GSDIa.},

  abstract = {The meninges, formed by dura, arachnoid and pia mater, cover the central nervous system and provide important barrier functions. Located between arachnoid and pia mater, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-filled subarachnoid space (SAS) features a variety of trabeculae, septae and pillars. Like the arachnoid and the pia mater, these structures are covered with leptomeningeal or meningothelial cells (MECs) that form a barrier between CSF and the parenchyma of the optic nerve (ON). MECs contribute to the CSF proteome through extensive protein secretion. In vitro, they were shown to phagocytose potentially toxic proteins, such as α-synuclein and amyloid beta, as well as apoptotic cell bodies. They therefore may contribute to CSF homeostasis in the SAS as a functional exchange surface. Determining the total area of the SAS covered by these cells that are in direct contact with CSF is thus important for estimating their potential contribution to CSF homeostasis. Using synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SRµCT), two 0.75 mm-thick sections of a human optic nerve were acquired at a resolution of 0.325 µm/pixel, producing images of multiple terabytes capturing the geometrical details of the CSF space. Special-purpose supercomputing techniques were employed to obtain a pixel-accurate morphometric description of the trabeculae and estimate internal volume and surface area of the ON SAS. In the bulbar segment, the ON SAS microstructure is shown to amplify the MECs surface area up to 4.85-fold compared to an "empty" ON SAS, while just occupying 35% of the volume. In the intraorbital segment, the microstructure occupies 35% of the volume and amplifies the ON SAS area 3.24-fold. We provided for the first time an estimation of the interface area between CSF and MECs. This area is of importance for estimating a potential contribution of MECs on CSF homeostasis.},

This was a retrospective review of patients from two tertiary ophthalmology centers in France initiating the RTE protocol between February 2018 and June 2021. The primary outcome was change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after 24 months. Secondary outcomes were change in central retinal thickness (CRT), recurrence, and management-related factors (injection interval, number of injections/consultations). Outcomes were additionally evaluated after protocol changes (strict versus modified RTE protocol groups). Sixty-eight patients (72 eyes) were included (68% females; mean age 82.2 ± 7.8 years). After 24 months, mean BCVA significantly improved (65.22 ± 14 vs. 71.96 ± 13 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters; p < 0.001) and CRT significantly decreased (388.6 ± 104 vs. 278.8 ± 51 μM; p < 0.001) with 21% of eyes showing signs of exudation. Over the 24 months, a mean total of 14.9 ± 4.0 injections and 8.6 ± 1.4 consultations were performed. Mean 24-month injection interval was 7.9 ± 2.3 weeks. Initial and 24-month ophthalmic outcomes for eyes in the strict (47%) versus modified (53%) groups were not significantly different, but mean time interval to first recurrence of disease activity was significantly shorter for the modified group (7.3 ± 2.4 vs. 9.9 ± 2.5 weeks; p < 0.001). Patients in the strict RTE group received significantly less injections (13.9 ± 3.6 vs. 16.5 ± 3.9; p = 0.006) and mean 24-month injection interval was significantly longer (9.5 ± 2.7 vs. 6.5 ± 2.1 weeks; p < 0.001). Consultation number was similar (8.5 ± 1.9 vs. 8.8 ± 1.6; p = 0.93). Treatment with aflibercept versus ranibizumab did not influence ophthalmic or management outcomes. The RTE protocol, even when modified, reduced consultations but improved ophthalmic outcomes. The RTE protocol could reduce hospital visits and overall burden while also encouraging better patient compliance. Video Abstract available for this article.

These analyses revealed that most of the complex-type N-glycans in the plants expressing GnT-III were bisected and carried at least two terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in contrast to wild-type plants, where a considerable proportion of N-glycans did not contain GlcNAc residues at the nonreducing end. Moreover, we have shown that the majority of N-glycans of an antibody produced in a plant expressing GnT-III is also bisected.

A device to deliver bone graft evenly throughout the tibial tunnel was developed. Forty mature sheep underwent simulated quadruple hamstring tendon-ACL reconstruction by use of a bioresorbable interference screw, either with or without bone graft augmentation of the tibial tunnel. Endpoint data were derived at time 0 and after 6 weeks in vivo. Radiostereometric analysis provided quantitation of the translational characteristics; computed tomography evaluated tunnel volume, and measures of yield strength and stiffness were obtained. Sequential fluorochrome administration assessed bone formation, and light microscopy surveyed the biological response. Radiostereometric analysis highlighted differences in the translational characteristics of ACL-deficient knees when compared with intact knees. Reconstructed knees (with or without autograft) showed significantly greater translation when compared with unoperated knees at 6 weeks; autograft bone augmentation provided no benefit. Neither tunnel volume nor yield strength nor stiffness was improved with the addition of autograft bone. No untoward histologic responses were observed. Bone apposition rates were similar between treatment groups. An even distribution of bone graft throughout the tunnels was observed. This model has confirmed the ability of the bone graft-delivery system to evenly distribute bone graft throughout the tunnels. However, the study has failed to show improvement in stability or fixation strength after augmentation with autograft bone. The autograft bone-delivery system may provide a means of establishing an osteoconductive/inductive environment. At this early juncture (6 weeks), no benefit could be defined. Its use in combination with bone morphogenetic proteins or stem cells may provide more rapid fixation, rehabilitation, and reconstitution of bone volume within the tunnel.},

Intervention with small-molecule antivirals specific for respiratory syncytial virus presents an important therapeutic opportunity, but no such compounds are approved today. Here we report the structure of JNJ-53718678 bound to respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) protein in its prefusion conformation, and we show that the potent nanomolar activity of JNJ-53718678, as well as the preliminary structure-activity relationship and the pharmaceutical optimization strategy of the series, are consistent with the binding mode of JNJ-53718678 and other respiratory syncytial virus fusion inhibitors. Oral treatment of neonatal lambs with JNJ-53718678, or with an equally active close analog, efficiently inhibits established acute lower respiratory tract infection in the animals, even when treatment is delayed until external signs of respiratory syncytial virus illness have become visible. Together, these data suggest that JNJ-53718678 is a promising candidate for further development as a potential therapeutic in patients at risk to develop respiratory syncytial virus acute lower respiratory tract infection.Respiratory syncytial virus causes lung infections in children, immunocompromised adults, and in the elderly. Here the authors show that a chemical inhibitor to a viral fusion protein is effective in reducing viral titre and ameliorating infection in rodents and neonatal lambs.},

To describe the phenotype of paroxysmal non-epileptic episodes related to KCNMA1 pathogenic variants. Videos of paroxysmal episodes were reviewed according to a standardized protocol by a group of movement disorders experts. Fourteen videos were reviewed (6 previously published patients and a new patient). The typical pattern of an episode was (i) facial changes including dyskinetic movements of tongue and jaws (ii) behavioral arrest (iii) loss of postural reflexes that could be associated with focal body stiffness, eventually leading to fall (iv) rapid recovery without post-ictal drowsiness. Attacks were brief, with a high daily frequency, occasionally triggered by emotion, and dramatically improved by psychostimulant therapy in three patients. KCNMA1-related attacks are clearly distinguishable from paroxysmal dyskinesia, cataplexy or episodic ataxia indicating a unique phenomenological entity whose recognition will enhance accurate diagnosis and treatment.},

She had presented at the peripheral hospital with gradual onset of left eye leukocoria for 1 year and pain for 2 months. B-scan showed a mass in the left eye. A clinical diagnosis of retinoblastoma was made. Left eye enucleation was performed; the patient was referred to MNH, with the enucleated specimen. Brain and orbits scan revealed no residual tumour. The globe measured 2 x 1.8 cm, the optic nerve stump measured 3 mm. A whitish mass filled the vitreous, with complete retinal detachment. Microscopy showed retinal gliosis, detachment with sub retinal PAS positive exudates, vacuolation and cholesterol clefts. Foreign body giant cells were present; telangiectatic thin-walled blood vessels were identified. Clinico-pathological findings were of stage 4 Coats' disease. Coats' disease is an important differential diagnosis of retinoblastoma. Delay to detect Coats' disease leads to vision loss which necessitates eye enucleation as was in this child.},

Our geodatabase harmonizes 48 different, mostly field-based datasets of primary forests, and contains 18,411 individual patches (41.1 Mha) spread across 33 countries. When available, we provide information on each patch (name, location, naturalness, extent and dominant tree species) and the surrounding landscape (biogeographical regions, protection status, potential natural vegetation, current forest extent). Using Landsat satellite-image time series (1985-2018) we checked each patch for possible disturbance events since primary forests were identified, resulting in 94% of patches free of significant disturbances in the last 30 years. Although knowledge gaps remain, ours is the most comprehensive dataset on primary forests in Europe, and will be useful for ecological studies, and conservation planning to safeguard these unique forests.},

The strength can be tightly controlled by varying the number of layers or the density and length of the fibrils in the protein layers. The mechanical stability of these microcapsules appears to be superior to that of currently available multilayer capsules.

The primary aim of our study was to determine whether BIS values recorded at loss and return of consciousness (LOC and ROC, respectively) differ between patients with unilateral frontal brain tumours and control patients. Secondary goals were to compare propofol requirements for LOC and to determine whether there were significant inter-hemispheric differences between BIS values in tumour and control patients. We enrolled 20 patients with a frontal brain tumour and 20 control patients. Bilateral BIS measurements were done during induction of propofol anaesthesia, during recovery of consciousness, and during a second induction of anaesthesia. The isolated-forearm test was used to determine the moments of LOC1, ROC, and LOC2. Arterial blood samples were obtained every 4 min for determination of measured propofol concentrations. The median BIS values recorded at LOC1, ROC, and LOC2 did not differ between the groups. There were no significant inter-hemispheric differences in BIS in tumour and control patients. The median [inter-quartile range (IQR)] total propofol doses at LOC1 were 82 (75-92) and 78 (68-91) mg in tumour and control patients, respectively. The median (IQR) measured plasma propofol concentrations at LOC1 were 12 (9-14) and 13 (11-15) µg ml(-1) in the tumour and control groups, respectively. The presence of a frontal brain tumour did not affect ipsilateral BIS values, and so need not influence the placement of unilateral BIS electrodes if BIS monitoring is used to titrate propofol anaesthesia.},

Also, it induces oxidative stress. Melatonin acts as a potent natural antioxidant and regulates the reproductive function by modification of steroidogenesis. The present study was conducted to provide detailed qualitative histological analysis of uterus of female rats treated with zearalenone and melatonin and contribute to better understanding of the topic. Forty adult, female Wistar rats were equally divided into five groups: Z group - zearalenone, 0,3 mg/kg, i.g.; M group - melatonin, 10 mg/kg, i.p.; ZM group -concomitant application of zearalenone and melatonin in the same dosing regimen, VZ group-zearalenone vehiculum/sunflower oil, i.g. and MZ group-melatonin vehiculum/5% ethanol in Ringer, i.p. Animals were treated daily for 28 consecutive days. After that period, all animals were sacrificed to obtain samples for qualitative histological analysis using the light microscope. Zearalenone led to the alterations of the uterine structures, predominantly in the endometrium that were characterized by metaplasia and hypertrophy of the epithelial cells and hypercellularity of the stroma. In the myometrium, zearalenone induced hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the myocytes. Melatonin, when applied together with zearalenone, blocked the adverse effects of the zearalenone.},

Measurements were recorded on the native liver, the portocaval shunt, following reperfusion and after biliary anastomosis. After LT HAF and PVF do not immediately return to normal values. Increased PVF was observed after graft implantation. Living donor LT showed the highest compliance to portal hyperperfusion. The amount of liver perfusion seemed to be related to the quality of the graft. A positive correlation for HAF, PVF and total hepatic blood flow with cardiac output was found (p = 0.001). Portal hypertension, macrosteatosis >30%, warm ischemia time and cardiac output, independently influence the hepatic flows. These results highlight the role of systemic hemodynamic management in LT to optimize hepatic perfusion, particularly in LDLT and split LT, where the highest flows were registered.},

Chest tomography: pulmonary hypoplasia. Patient submitted to bilateral thoracoplasty and thoracotomy with general anesthesia. Anesthesia maintenance: sufentanil e sevoflurane continuous infusion. Ventilation parameters: pressure-cycled mechanical ventilation. Thorax opening provided improvement of the ventilation parameters, but after thoracic prosthesis placement, ventilation was limited. Reduction of the thoracic prosthesis was considered with consequent improvement of ventilation. Diagnosis of all present abnormalities is essential for the correct anesthetic management. Observation was necessary to adequate pre- and post-thoracotomy/thoracoplasty ventilation and to maintain patient hemodynamically stable. Pressure-cycled mechanical ventilation is the most adequate type of ventilation to overcome the mechanical barrier. In the intraoperative setting, the ideal is to maintain the inspiratory pressure peak as low as possible to minimize the risk of barotrauma, venous return impairment and reduced cardiac output.},

In the EX1 limit, observed exchange rates become pH-independent and exclusively sensitive to local structure fluctuations that expose the amide proton HN to exchange. Close to this regime, we measured decay rates of individual backbone HN signals in D2O, and of their mutual HN-HN NOE by time-resolved two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments. The data revealed correlated exchange at the center of the lac headpiece recognition helix, Val20-Val23, and suggested that the correlation breaks down at Val24, at the C terminus of the helix. A lower degree of correlation was observed for the exchange of Val9 and Ala10 at the center of helix 1, while no correlation was observed for Val38 and Glu39 at the center of helix 3. We conclude that HN exchange in the recognition helix and, to some extent, in helix 1 is a cooperative event involving the unfolding of these helices, whereas the HN exchange in helix 3 is dominated by random local structure fluctuations.},

Depression, disturbed sleep, and anxiety were assessed by the 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire, 7-Item Insomnia Severity Index, and 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale respectively. Responses were analyzed dichotomously according to published threshold values, characterizing the relative frequency distribution of prevalence (PCRS) or non-prevalence of clinically relevant symptoms (NPCRS). Out of all participants, 47 [17.1%], Z(274) = 15.38, p = .001, 32 [11.7%], Z(274) = 17.94, p = .001, and 49 [17.9%], Z(274) = 15.04, p = .001 had PCRS of anxiety, insomnia, and depression, respectively.

Compared with individual sport athletes, team sport athletes were more likely to report PCRS of insomnia (12 [37.5%] vs 20 [62.5%], Z(274) = -2.00, p = .046), and depression (18 [36.7%] vs 31 [63.3%], Z(274) = -2.63, p = .009) but not for anxiety. Athletes reported high levels of mental health problems during the lockdown. Team sport athletes reported worse symptoms of insomnia and depression than individual sport athletes, possibly due to the impact of unaccustomed social isolation and lack of social team activity. Therefore, it becomes relevant to consider psychological support to team sport athletes who for some reason, such as a pandemic, enduring crisis even injury rehabilitation needs to be isolated.},

  abstract = {In peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), accurate quantification of kidney activity on post-treatment SPECT images paves the way for patient-specific treatment. Due to the limited spatial resolution of SPECT images, the partial volume effect (PVE) is a significant source of quantitative bias. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance and robustness of anatomy-based partial volume correction (PVC) algorithms to recover the accurate activity concentration of realistic kidney geometries on [Formula: see text]Lu SPECT images recorded under clinical conditions. Based on the CT scan data from patients, three sets of fillable kidneys with surface-to-volume (S:V) ratios ranging from 1.5 to 2.8 cm Without PVC, the average kidney RCs across all TBRs ranged from 0.66 ± 0.05 (smallest kidney) to 0.80 ± 0.03 (largest kidney). For a TBR of 12, all anatomy-based method were able to recover the kidneys activity concentration with an error < 6%. All methods result in a comparable decline in RC restoration with decreasing TBR. The Labbé method was the most robust against PSF and registration mismatches but was also the most sensitive to background heterogeneity. Among the voxel-based methods, MTC images were less uniform than RBV and IY images at the outer edge of high uptake areas (kidneys and spheres). Anatomy-based PVE correction allows for accurate SPECT quantification of the [Formula: see text]Lu activity concentration with realistic kidney geometries. Combined with recent progress in deep-learning algorithms for automatic anatomic segmentation of whole-body CT, these methods could be of particular interest for a fully automated OAR dosimetry pipeline with PVE correction.},

Regenerative potential of hCPCs is severely limited with age, requiring genetic modification to enhance therapeutic potential. A legacy of work from our laboratory with Pim1 kinase reveals effects on proliferation, survival, metabolism, and rejuvenation of hCPCs in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that subcellular targeting of Pim1 bolsters the distinct cardioprotective effects of this kinase in hCPCs to increase proliferation and survival, and antagonize cellular senescence. Adult hCPCs isolated from patients undergoing left ventricular assist device implantation were engineered to overexpress Pim1 throughout the cell (PimWT) or targeted to either mitochondrial (Mito-Pim1) or nuclear (Nuc-Pim1) compartments. Nuc-Pim1 enhances stem cell youthfulness associated with decreased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, preserved telomere length, reduced expression of p16 and p53, and up-regulation of nucleostemin relative to PimWT hCPCs. Alternately, Mito-Pim1 enhances survival by increasing expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL and decreasing cell death after H2O2 treatment, thereby preserving mitochondrial integrity superior to PimWT. Mito-Pim1 increases the proliferation rate by up-regulation of cell cycle modulators Cyclin D, CDK4, and phospho-Rb. Optimal stem cell traits such as proliferation, survival, and increased youthful properties of aged hCPCs are enhanced after targeted Pim1 localization to mitochondrial or nuclear compartments. Targeted Pim1 overexpression in hCPCs allows for selection of the desired phenotypic properties to overcome patient variability and improve specific stem cell characteristics.},

After storage for 2.5 to 4 years, PCT levels in patient sera declined only 3.7%. Passing-Bablok regression analysis of the total sample range (n = 97) showed that both methods correlated well (r = 0.9944), although with a deviation from the line of identity (y = 0.880x - 0.025 microg/L). Comparison of both methods within the clinically important interval of 0 - 2.0 microg/L showed acceptable correlation (y = 0.943x + 0.010 microg/L). The ADVIA Centaur B.R.A.H.M.S PCT assay showed good correlation with the established Kryptor method.

Previous isolated forearm technique data suggest that the incidence of connected consciousness may approach 37% after a noxious stimulus. The authors conducted an international, multicenter, pragmatic study to establish the incidence of isolated forearm technique responsiveness after intubation in routine practice. Two hundred sixty adult patients were recruited at six sites into a prospective cohort study of the isolated forearm technique after intubation. Demographic, anesthetic, and intubation data, plus postoperative questionnaires, were collected. Univariate statistics, followed by bivariate logistic regression models for age plus variable, were conducted. The incidence of isolated forearm technique responsiveness after intubation was 4.6% (12/260); 5 of 12 responders reported pain through a second hand squeeze. Responders were younger than nonresponders (39 ± 17 vs. 51 ± 16 yr old; P = 0.01) with more frequent signs of sympathetic activation (50% vs. 2.4%; P = 0.03). No participant had explicit recall of intraoperative events when questioned after surgery (n = 253). Across groups, depth of anesthesia monitoring values showed a wide range; however, values were higher for responders before (54 ± 20 vs. 42 ± 14; P = 0.02) and after (52 ± 16 vs. 43 ± 16; P = 0.02) intubation. In patients not receiving total intravenous anesthesia, exposure to volatile anesthetics before intubation reduced the odds of responding (odds ratio, 0.2 [0.1 to 0.8]; P = 0.02) after adjustment for age. Intraoperative connected consciousness occurred frequently, although the rate is up to 10-times lower than anticipated. This should be considered a conservative estimate of intraoperative connected consciousness.},

Codlemone (1) was prepared in excellent stereoselectivity in a new, iterative approach involving two Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reactions. Methyl ketone (2), keto ester (3) and diketone (4) were obtained from codlemone in straightforward approaches in good overall yields and excellent stereochemical purity (≥98% E,E). In electrophysiology, only compound 2 displayed inhibition of the antennal response to the pheromone after presaturation of the antennal receptors. Compounds 2 to 4 did not inhibit the pheromone-degrading enzyme responsible for codlemone metabolism, but mixtures of ketone 2 and diketone 4 with codlemone elicited erratic flights on males in a wind tunnel. In the field, blends of either compound (2 or 4) with the pheromone caught significantly fewer males than codlemone alone. Codlemone and the potential antagonists 2 to 4 have been synthesised in good yields and excellent stereoselectivity. These chemicals behave as pheromone antagonists of the codling moth both in the laboratory and in the field.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated specific alleles and genes as risk factors for numerous complex traits. However, translating GWAS results into biologically and therapeutically meaningful discoveries remains extremely challenging. Most GWAS results identify noncoding regions of the genome, suggesting that differences in gene regulation are the major driver of trait variability. To better integrate GWAS results with gene regulatory polymorphisms, we previously developed PrediXcan (also known as "transcriptome-wide association studies" or TWAS), which maps SNPs to predicted gene expression using GWAS data. In this study, we developed RatXcan, a framework that extends this methodology to outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats. RatXcan accounts for the close familial relationships among HS rats by modeling the relatedness with a random effect that encodes the genetic relatedness. RatXcan also corrects for polygenic-driven inflation because of the equivalence between a relatedness random effect and the infinitesimal polygenic model. To develop RatXcan, we trained transcript predictors for 8,934 genes using reference genotype and expression data from five rat brain regions. We found that the cis genetic architecture of gene expression in both rats and humans was sparse and similar across brain tissues. We tested the association between predicted expression in rats and two example traits (body length and BMI) using phenotype and genotype data from 5,401 densely genotyped HS rats and identified a significant enrichment between the genes associated with rat and human body length and BMI. Thus, RatXcan represents a valuable tool for identifying the relationship between gene expression and phenotypes across species and paves the way to explore shared biological mechanisms of complex traits.},

Attention deployment (AD) and cognitive reappraisal (CR) are both efficient cognitive ER strategies, which are based on partially dissociated neural effects. Our understanding of the neural underpinnings of ER is based on laboratory paradigms that study changes of the brain activation related to isolated emotional stimuli. To track the neural response to ER in the changing and dynamic environment of daily life, we extended the common existing paradigms by applying a sequence of emotionally provocative stimuli involving three aversive images. Eighteen participants completed an ER paradigm, in which they had to either shift their attention away from the emotionally negative images by counting backwards (AD strategy) or reinterpret the meaning of stimuli (CR strategy) to attain a down-regulation of affective responses. An increased recruitment of left-sided lateral and medial PFC was shown upon regulation of negative emotions with CR as compared to AD. Remarkably, the amygdala activation showed an increasing pattern of activation during CR. The inverse relationship between PFC and amygdala was compromised during elongated blocks of reappraisal, reflecting a reduction in engagement of the top-down prefrontal regulatory circuitry upon repeated exposure to negative stimuli. These results highlight that temporal dynamic of amygdala response and its functional connectivity differentiates AD and CR strategies in regulating emotions. Findings of the current study underscore the importance of adopting temporally variant approaches for investigating the neural effects of ER. Identifying neural systems that subserve down-regulation of negative emotions is of importance in developing treatment strategies for various forms of psychopathology.},

However, reliable and consistent findings have not been reported yet. Several methodological factors might be responsible for the discrepant findings, including the heterogeneity of patient samples in terms of symptom severity. In the current study, we combined investigations of the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of BPD patients with seed-based connectivity measures and then computed the correlation of connectivity measures with borderline symptom severity. Correlation-based connectivity analysis was performed on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 26 female BPD patients and 26 healthy controls. Increased intrinsic connectivity was found in clusters involving part of the caudate nucleus and the left insula in the patient group, indicating greater integration of each region. Further seed-based connectivity analyses revealed that with the caudate seed, the patient data exhibited an increased resting-state functional connectivity in the bilateral ventral striatum and the midline prefrontal regions extending to the ACC, a network associated with reward processing. The left insula seed showed significantly increased connectivity with the bilateral fronto-orbital/insula, the inferior parietal lobule and the mid-cingulate cortex, a network involved in attention and salience encoding, in the patient population. Moreover, symptom severity, as assessed with the BSL-95 outside the scanner, was negatively correlated with the coupling of the insula and the striatum in the BPD group. Overall, an increased functional connectivity within two large-scale circuitries underlying reward and salience processing was evident in patients, as compared to healthy participants. When correlated with borderline symptom severity, a reduced connectivity between key regions belonging to the reward system and salience network was observed in the patients. These findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the BPD pathophysiology and thereby delineate potential treatment targets.},

Here, we report the development of a refined murine subcutaneous model for semi-orthotopic bone formation that allows the testing of up to four grafts per mouse one order of magnitude greater in volume than currently possible in mice. Crucially, these defects are also "critical size" and unable to heal within the timeframe of the study without intervention. The model is based on four bovine bone implants, ring-shaped, where the bone healing potential of distinct grafts can be evaluated in vivo. In this study we demonstrate that promotion and prevention of ossification can be assessed in our model. For this, we used a semi-automatic algorithm for longitudinal micro-CT image registration followed by histological analyses. Taken together, our data supports that this model is suitable as a platform for the real-time screening of bone formation, and provides the possibility to study bone resorption, osseointegration and vascularisation.},

We recommend basing intra-operative arterial pressure management on mean arterial pressure and keeping intra-operative mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg. We further recommend identifying the underlying causes of intra-operative hypotension and addressing them appropriately. We suggest pragmatically treating bradycardia or tachycardia when it leads to profound hypotension or likely results in reduced cardiac output, oxygen delivery or organ perfusion. We suggest monitoring stroke volume or cardiac output in patients with high baseline risk for complications or in patients having high-risk surgery to assess the haemodynamic status and the haemodynamic response to therapeutic interventions. However, we recommend not routinely maximising stroke volume or cardiac output in patients having noncardiac surgery. Instead, we suggest defining stroke volume and cardiac output targets individually for each patient considering the clinical situation and clinical and metabolic signs of tissue perfusion and oxygenation. We recommend not giving fluids simply because a patient is fluid responsive but only if there are clinical or metabolic signs of hypovolaemia or tissue hypoperfusion. We suggest monitoring and optimising the depth of anaesthesia to titrate doses of anaesthetic drugs and reduce their side effects.},

Therefore, three questions from the evaluation of the elective course were used. Online evaluation of the elective and questions addressing attitude were assessed using a five-point Likert scale. The specific outcome-based assessment was determined using the Comparative Self-Assessment Gain. The main participant group (group 1) were students who took the elective. The additional survey on attitudes towards assisted dying included undergraduate medical students who had taken compulsory palliative care courses (group 2) and physicians who had taken an introductory course in intensive care or emergency medicine (group 3). Group 1 (n = 13, response rate rr = 86.7%) was very satisfied with the blended learning format (100%) and the course itself (100%). They were able to deepen their knowledge (81.0%) and train skills (71.2%) through the course. In the additional surveys, there were 37 students in group 2 (rr = 66.1%) and 258 physicians in group 3 (rr = 73.6%). Willingness to assist with or accompany the various options for assisted dying varied according to the type of assistance. Among the participants, it can be summarised that the highest willingness was shown by the students of group 2 followed by the physicians of group 3 and the students of group 1. A course on handling the desire to die of palliative patients can deepen knowledge and train communication skills and thus support self-confidence. Dealing with the background of the desire to die, knowledge about assisted dying, but also one's own attitudes and responsibilities can influence the attitude towards assisted dying.},

  abstract = {Triggers have been developed internationally to identify intensive care patients with palliative care needs. Due to their work, nurses are close to the patient and their perspective should therefore be included. In this study, potential triggers were first identified and then a questionnaire was developed to analyse their acceptance among German intensive care nurses. For the qualitative part of this mixed methods study, focus groups were conducted with intensive care nurses from different disciplines (surgery, neurosurgery, internal medicine), which were selected by convenience. Data were analysed using the "content-structuring content analysis" according to Kuckartz. For the quantitative study part, the thus identified triggers formed the basis for questionnaire items. The questionnaire was tested for comprehensibility in cognitive pretests and for feasibility in a pilot survey. In the qualitative part six focus groups were conducted at four university hospitals. From the data four main categories (prognosis, interprofessional cooperation, relatives, patients) with three to 15 subcategories each could be identified. The nurses described situations requiring palliative care consults that related to the severity of the disease, the therapeutic course, communication within the team and between team and patient/relatives, and typical characteristics of patients and relatives. In addition, a professional conflict between nurses and physicians emerged. The questionnaire, which was developed after six cognitive interviews, consists of 32 items plus one open question. The pilot had a response rate of 76.7% (23/30), whereby 30 triggers were accepted with an agreement of ≥ 50%. Intensive care nurses see various triggers, with interprofessional collaboration and the patient's prognosis playing a major role. The questionnaire can be used for further surveys, e.g. interprofessional triggers could be developed.},

  abstract = {Sustaining Basic Life Support (BLS) training during the COVID-19 pandemic bears substantial challenges. The limited availability of highly qualified instructors and tight economic conditions complicates the delivery of these life-saving trainings. Consequently, innovative and resource-efficient approaches are needed to minimize or eliminate contagion while maintaining high training standards and managing learner anxiety related to infection risk. In a non-inferiority trial 346 first-year medical, dentistry, and physiotherapy students underwent BLS training at AIXTRA-Competence Center for Training and Patient Safety at the University Hospital RWTH Aachen. Our objectives were (1) to examine whether peer feedback BLS training supported by tele-instructors matches the learning performance of standard instructor-guided BLS training for laypersons; and (2) to minimize infection risk during BLS training. Therefore, in a parallel group design, we compared arm (1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) BLS training (Historical control group of 2019) with arm (2) a Tele-Instructor Supported Peer-Feedback (TPF) BLS training (Intervention group of 2020). Both study arms were based on Peyton's 4-step approach. Before and after each training session, objective data for BLS performance (compression depth and rate) were recorded using a resuscitation manikin. We also assessed overall BLS performance via standardized instructor evaluation and student self-reports of confidence via questionnaire. Non-inferiority margins for the outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with SIF. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority. The results confirmed non-inferiority of TPF to SIF for all tested outcome parameters. A follow-up after 2 weeks found no confirmed COVID-19 infections among the participants. Tele-instructor supported peer feedback is a powerful alternative to in-person instructor feedback on BLS skills during a pandemic, where infection risk needs to be minimized while maximizing the quality of BLS skill learning. https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00025199, Trial ID: DRKS00025199.},

The classic example is found in gene transcription where small ligands regulate nuclear receptor binding to coactivator proteins via the dynamic activation function 2 (AF2) interface. Current ligands target the ligand-binding pocket side of the AF2. Few ligands are known, which selectively target the coactivator side of the AF2, or which can be selectively switched from one side of the interface to the other. We use NMR spectroscopy and modeling to identify a natural product, which targets the retinoid X receptor (RXR) at both sides of the AF2. We then use chemical synthesis, cellular screening and X-ray co-crystallography to split this dual activity, leading to a potent and molecularly efficient RXR agonist, and a first-of-kind inhibitor selective for the RXR/coactivator interaction. Our findings justify future exploration of natural products at dynamic protein interfaces.},

  abstract = {Combined EEG-fMRI analysis correlates time courses from single electrodes or independent EEG components with the hemodynamic response. Implementing information from only one electrode, however, may miss relevant information from complex electrophysiological networks. Component based analysis, in turn, depends on a priori knowledge of the signal topography. Complex designs such as studies on multisensory integration of emotions investigate subtle differences in distributed networks based on only a few trials per condition. Thus, they require a sensitive and comprehensive approach which does not rely on a-priori knowledge about the underlying neural processes. In this pilot study, feasibility and sensitivity of source localization-driven analysis for EEG-fMRI was tested using a multisensory integration paradigm. Dynamic audiovisual stimuli consisting of emotional talking faces and pseudowords with emotional prosody were rated in a delayed response task. The trials comprised affectively congruent and incongruent displays. In addition to event-locked EEG and fMRI analyses, induced oscillatory EEG responses at estimated cortical sources and in specific temporo-spectral windows were correlated with the corresponding BOLD responses. EEG analysis showed high data quality with less than 10% trial rejection. In an early time window, alpha oscillations were suppressed in bilateral occipital cortices and fMRI analysis confirmed high data quality with reliable activation in auditory, visual and frontal areas to the presentation of multisensory stimuli. In line with previous studies, we obtained reliable correlation patterns for event locked occipital alpha suppression and BOLD signal time course. Our results suggest a valid methodological approach to investigate complex stimuli using the present source localization driven method for EEG-fMRI. This novel procedure may help to investigate combined EEG-fMRI data from novel complex paradigms with high spatial and temporal resolution.},

  abstract = {Cardiac inwardly rectifying Kir current (IK1) mediates terminal repolarisation and is critical for the stabilization of the diastolic membrane potential. Its predominant molecular basis in mammalian ventricle is heterotetrameric assembly of Kir2.1 and Kir2.2 channel subunits. It has been shown that PKC inhibition of IK1 promotes focal ventricular ectopy. However, the underlying molecular mechanism has not been fully elucidated to date. In the Xenopus oocyte expression system, we observed a pronounced PKC-induced inhibition of Kir2.2 but not Kir2.1 currents. The PKC regulation of Kir2.2 could be reproduced by an activator of conventional PKC isoforms and antagonized by pharmacological inhibition of PKCβ. In isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes (rat, mouse), pharmacological activation of conventional PKC isoforms induced a pronounced inhibition of IK1. The PKC effect in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes was markedly attenuated following co-application of a small molecule inhibitor of PKCβ. Underlining the critical role of PKCβ, the PKC-induced inhibition of IK1 was absent in homozygous PKCβ knockout-mice. After heterologous expression of Kir2.1-Kir2.2 concatemers in Xenopus oocytes, heteromeric Kir2.1/Kir2.2 currents were also inhibited following activation of PKC. We conclude that inhibition of cardiac IK1 by PKC critically depends on the PKCβ isoform and Kir2.2 subunits. This regulation represents a potential novel target for the antiarrhythmic therapy of focal ventricular arrhythmias.},

  abstract = {In order to successfully move from place to place, our brain often combines sensory inputs from various sources by dynamically weighting spatial cues according to their reliability and relevance for a given task. Two of the most important cues in navigation are the spatial arrangement of landmarks in the environment, and the continuous path integration of travelled distances and changes in direction. Several studies have shown that Bayesian integration of cues provides a good explanation for navigation in environments dominated by small numbers of easily identifiable landmarks. However, it remains largely unclear how cues are combined in more complex environments. To investigate how humans process and combine landmarks and path integration in complex environments, we conducted a series of triangle completion experiments in virtual reality, in which we varied the number of landmarks from an open steppe to a dense forest, thus going beyond the spatially simple environments that have been studied in the past. We analysed spatial behaviour at both the population and individual level with linear regression models and developed a computational model, based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), to infer the underlying combination of cues. Overall homing performance was optimal in an environment containing three landmarks arranged around the goal location. With more than three landmarks, individual differences between participants in the use of cues are striking. For some, the addition of landmarks does not worsen their performance, whereas for others it seems to impair their use of landmark information. It appears that navigation success in complex environments depends on the ability to identify the correct clearing around the goal location, suggesting that some participants may not be able to see the forest for the trees.},

Sixty ASA I-II patients were anaesthetized with thiopentone, fentanyl, halothane and nitrous oxide and assigned randomly to four groups. Each patient received an initial dose (ID) of either vecuronium (V) or ORG 9487 (O) followed by maintenance doses (MDn) of either V or O (ID/MD: O/O, V/O, O/V, and V/V). The time course of action was measured mechanomyographically, determining the duration until 25% recovery of the single twitch (DUR25). The onset time of an ID of ORG 9487 was shorter than that of an ID of vecuronium (96 vs 203 sec, P < 0.001). The DUR25 of the ID of ORG 9487 was less than half that of vecuronium (10.7 +/- 2.8 vs 28.8 +/- 6.1 min, P < 0.001). The DUR25 of MD1 and MD2 of ORG 9487 were shorter than those of vecuronium (O/O: 7.3 +/- 2.8 and 8.5 +/- 2.4 min; V/O: 12.7 +/- 3.3 and 11.5 +/- 3.5 min, vs O/V: 16.4 +/- 4.5 and 20.6 +/- 4.7 min; V/V: 18.8 +/- 3.0 and 20.1 +/- 3.8 min, respectively, P < 0.05). AN ID of vecuronium prolonged the DUR25 of MD1 and MD2 of ORG 9487 (P < 0.05). ORG 9487 is a muscle relaxant with a shorter duration of action than vecuronium. Maintenance doses of ORG 9487 are also shorter acting than roughly equipotent maintenance doses of vecuronium, irrespective of which relaxant is given initially.},

Meat from domestic pigs, which represent a major animal reservoir of HEV, plays a key role in HEV transmission.

Here, we used a newly developed method for virus extraction from sausages and a quantitative method for detecting HEV infectivity in artificially contaminated sausages to investigate the HEV inactivation during production of spreadable pork liver sausage and salami-like raw pork sausage. The cell culture-adapted HEV genotype 3c strain 47832c was used to contaminate meat preparations intended for production of sausages, which were manufactured based on recipes commonly used in Germany. According to these recipes, spreadable liver sausages of a certain diameter are to be held in a water bath at 70 °C for 30 min. Therefore, the HEV inoculated liver sausage preparations were filled into conical tubes and heated in a 70 °C water bath. After 21 min, the sausages reached a core temperature of 70 °C and samples were taken after further incubation for up to 18 min. For the raw sausages, the HEV inoculated meat preparation was filled into natural casings and sausages were cured at 18 °C and 80 % relative humidity. Samples were taken for up to 21 days.

We assessed the agronomic suitability and impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia emissions of using liquid mineral concentrates on arable farms. The phosphate requirements on arable farms were largely met by raw pig slurry, given its large regional availability. After the initial nutrient input by means of pig slurry, the nitrogen/phosphate ratio of the remaining nutrient crop requirements determined the additional amount of liquid mineral concentrates that can be used. For sandy soils, liquid mineral concentrates could supply 50% of the nitrogen requirement, whereas for clay soils the concentrates did not meet the required nitrogen/phosphate ratio. The total GHG emissions per kg of plant available nitrogen ranged from -65 to 33 kg CO2 -equivalents. It increased in the order digestates < mineral fertiliser < raw slurries. Liquid mineral concentrates had limited added value for arable farms. For an increased suitability it is necessary that liquid mineral concentrates do not contain phosphate and that the nitrogen availability is increased. In the manure-processing chain, anaerobic digestion had a dominant and beneficial effect on GHG emissions.},

Advances, such as synchronized electro-optical and galvanometric beam steering and a stabilization that locks the sample position to sub-nanometer precision with respect to the stand, ensure nanometer-precise and accurate real-time localization of individually activated fluorophores. In our MINFLUX imaging of cell- and neurobiological samples, ~800 detected photons suffice to attain a localization precision of 2.2 nm, whereas ~2500 photons yield precisions <1 nm (standard deviation). We further demonstrate 3D imaging with localization precision of ~2.4 nm in the focal plane and ~1.9 nm along the optic axis. Localizing with a precision of <20 nm within ~100 µs, we establish this spatio-temporal resolution in single fluorophore tracking and apply it to the diffusion of single labeled lipids in lipid-bilayer model membranes.},

This study aimed to examine the role of error framing in basic life support (BLS) training for future healthcare professionals. In an equivalence trial ( The results regarding CD revealed equivalence with a trend toward superiority of EM over EA (proportional difference 23.3%-points; 95% CI 11.4%-34.2%) and EM over control (proportional difference 23.4%-points; 95% CI 11.5%-34.2%.) and significant equivalence of EA and control (proportional difference 0.1%-points; 95% CI -11.6%-11.7%). Significant equivalence was determined for all study arms with respect to CR and self-confidence. Our study revealed that EM was not detrimental to learners' CPR performance. Given existing research on long-term beneficial effects of EM on patient safety, coupled with the proven equivalence of EM and EA concerning short-term performance, we argue that EM is a promising approach for future medical education purposes.

  abstract = {Freeze-fracture electron microscopy has been a major technique in ultrastructural research for over 40 years. However, the lack of effective means to study the molecular composition of membranes produced a significant decline in its use. Recently, there has been a major revival in freeze-fracture electron microscopy thanks to the development of effective ways to reveal integral membrane proteins by immunogold labeling. One of these methods is known as detergent-solubilized Freeze-fracture Replica Immunolabeling (FRIL). The combination of the FRIL technique with optogenetics allows a correlated analysis of the structural and functional properties of central synapses. Using this approach it is possible to identify and characterize both pre- and postsynaptic neurons by their respective expression of a tagged channelrhodopsin and specific molecular markers. The distinctive appearance of the postsynaptic membrane specialization of glutamatergic synapses further allows, upon labeling of ionotropic glutamate receptors, to quantify and analyze the intrasynaptic distribution of these receptors. Here, we give a step-by-step description of the procedures required to prepare paired replicas and how to immunolabel them. We will also discuss the caveats and limitations of the FRIL technique, in particular those associated with potential sampling biases. The high reproducibility and versatility of the FRIL technique, when combined with optogenetics, offers a very powerful approach for the characterization of different aspects of synaptic transmission at identified neuronal microcircuits in the brain. Here, we provide an example how this approach was used to gain insights into structure-function relationships of excitatory synapses at neurons of the intercalated cell masses of the mouse amygdala. In particular, we have investigated the expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors at identified inputs originated from the thalamic posterior intralaminar and medial geniculate nuclei. These synapses were shown to relay sensory information relevant for fear learning and to undergo plastic changes upon fear conditioning.},

I(to) and its molecular basis Kv4.3 are regulated by adrenergic pathways including protein kinase C. However, the exact regulatory mechanisms have not been analyzed yet. We here analyzed isoenzyme specific regulation of Kv4.3 and I(to) by PKC. Kv4.3 channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and currents were measured with double electrode voltage clamp technique. Patch clamp experiments were performed in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Unspecific PKC stimulation with PMA resulted in a reduction of Kv4.3 current. Similar effects could be observed after activation of conventional PKC isoforms by TMX. Both effects were reversible by pharmacological inhibition of the conventional PKC isoenzymes (Gö6976). In contrast, activation of the novel PKC isoforms (ingenol) did not significantly affect Kv4.3 current. Whereas TMX-induced PKC activation was not attenuated inhibition of PKCβ, inhibition of PKCα with HBDDE prevented inhibitory effects of both PMA and TMX. Accordingly, stimulatory effects of PMA and TMX could be mimicked by the α-isoenzyme selective PKC activator iripallidal. Further evidence for the central role of PKCα was provided with the use of siRNAs. We found that PKCα siRNA but not PKCβ siRNA abolished the TMX induced effect. In isolated rat cardiomyocytes, PMA dependent I(to) reduction could be completely abolished by pharmacologic inhibition of PKCα. In summary we show that PKCα plays a central role in protein kinase C dependent regulation of Kv4.3 current and native I(to). These results add to the current understanding of isoenzyme selective ion channel regulation by protein kinases.},

Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (RET-He) is considered to be an actual indicator reflecting functional iron availability for erythropoiesis. In the present study, interdependence between biochemical analytes reflecting iron status and hemocytometric parameters indicating the degree of hemoglobinization of reticulocytes and red blood cells, respectively, is established. Participants of the study were reference subjects (n=75), subjects with iron deficiency anemia (n=52), subjects with uremia (n=19) and subjects undergoing hemodialysis treatment (n=43). If compared with the reference subjects the results for RBC counts and MCHC are statistically significantly decreased in case of subjects with hemodialysis and uremia, whereas increased results are established with regard to RDW-sd values. Significantly increased results for absolute reticulocyte counts and immature reticulocyte fractions (IRF) are also observed in case of subjects with hemodialysis and uremia. Slightly increased values for the ZPP/heme ratio in combination with elevated reticulocyte count reflect increased activity of erythropoiesis. At a definite MCV value, decreased levels for the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (RET-He) and hemoglobin content of red blood cells (RBC-He) are observed in case of subjects treated with hemodialysis and in subjects with uremia if compared with identical MCV values of the group of reference subjects. For the ratio of RET-He and RBC-He obviously decreased results are demonstrated in case of subjects with iron deficiency anemia (1.02 +/- 0.08, mean +/- SD), hemodialysis (1.05 +/- 0.05) and uremia (1.02 +/- 0.10) if compared with the group of reference subjects (1.11 +/- 0.02). From the combined interpretation of the MCV values within the reference range and decreased values for RET-He and RET-He/RBC-He ratios, respectively, a decreased degree of hemoglobinization is concluded in the case of subjects with hemodialysis or uremia. The conclusion implicating the presumption of reduced functional availability of iron for hemoglobin synthesis is supported by the detection of increased results for sTfR concentrations and ZPP/heme ratios.},

Only a weak correlation is demonstrated between the increase of markers for activation of coagulation and the decrease in PLT counts, immature PLT counts and depleted PLTs during HD treatment.

Blood samples were taken before the start of HD treatment for measurement of PLT count, PLT volume and size parameters. Blood smears were screened by light microscopy for qualitative evaluation of PLT granule containing cytoplasm, as indicated by its staining density. Morphological PLT parameters of surface area and size of dense bodies were assessed by EM. Data were compared with results of a group of 20 chronic HD subjects and a group of 20 healthy reference subjects. With respect to the percentage of PLTs with appropriate staining density (>75%), light microscopic evaluation showed that this value (9%) was within the range of a group of chronic HD subjects, but considerably below the reference range (70%). EM evaluation revealed an average PLT surface area and dense bodies area of respectively 42% and 31%, if the healthy reference subject was set on 100%. PLTs from a chronic HD subject are considerably smaller and substantially less granular than PLTs from a healthy reference subject.

Twenty-five subjects with suspected IDE during pregnancy (Hb ≤110g/L, Ret-He <29.6 pg, zinc protoporphyrin >75 mol/mol hem) participated in the study. After iron supplementation, reticulocyte counts increased from 0.061±0.015×10(12)/L to 0.079±0.026×10(12)/L and Ret-He increased from 23.6±2.8 pg to 28.3±2.6 pg (P=<0.001).

We recommend that Ret-He and Ret-He/RBC-He ratio be integrated into the protocols for anemia screening and for monitoring effects of iron supplementation during pregnancy.

It is demonstrated that PLTs from HD patients are exhausted due to repeated stimulation of HD treatment and recurrent release of PLT degranulation products. During HD, additional aberrations of the haemostatic process occur. Besides deviations of coagulation and fibrinolysis, PLT activation and a reduction in their granule content have been observed during HD treatment. As HD treatment is carried out three times per week, month after month, chronic HD patients may suffer persistently from coagulation defects and PLT disorders on top of the alterations induced by the uraemic state itself. PLT activation occurs together with thrombin and fibrin generation. However, macro fibrin depositions in clot devices are not demonstrated, microaggregates occur not only in the extracorporeal circuit (ECC) but are also present in the blood circulation. As vascular access thrombosis is a frequent complication in patients with HD treatment, it is believed that hypercoagulability could result from vascular changes combined with PLTs and activation of coagulation factors.},

  abstract = {During haemodialysis (HD) treatment, increase of platelet (PLT) activation and induction of procoagulant activity is demonstrated. Although the role of the endothelium and its direct interaction with coagulation and homeostasis is known, it is not elucidated how PLT activation markers and activation of coagulation coincide with markers of endothelial integrity during HD treatment. In the present study uraemia and HD induced changes, with particular emphasis on PLT granules depletion, activation of coagulation and endothelial integrity were investigated. To detect depletion of PLT granules, peripheral blood slide smears were screened by light microscopy for qualitative evaluation of PLT granule containing cytoplasm, as indicated by its granules staining density. Activation of coagulation was investigated by establishement of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) and fibrinogen concentrations. To evaluate endothelial integrity proendothelin (proET-1) plasma concentrations were established. Results of our study demonstrate that proET-1 plasma concentrations were obviously increased in the subjects' group with end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal failure if compared with a group of apparently healthy subjects. The amount of depleted PLT granules was obviously increased in the subjects' group with end-stage CKD if compared with the group with renal failure. Mean plasma concentrations of TAT and fibrinogen revealed results within the reference range. It is demonstrated that uraemia is associated with endothelial damage and aberrations in PLT granules morphology in subjects with HD treatment. We hypothesize that increased proET-1 concentrations reflect ongoing stress on endothelial cells amongst others due to uraemia. Biomarkers like proET-1 and aberrations in PLT granules morphology assist in the early detection of procoagulant activity of the endothelium.},

The recently introduced Sysmex XN2000 analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) offers 3 methods for platelet counting: impedance (PLT-I), optical (PLT-O), and a new fluorescence method (PLT-F). The precision of the PLT-F method in blood samples with platelet counts less than 50 × 10(3)/μL (50 × 10(9)/L) was investigated and compared with the ICSH CD61-ImmunoPLT reference method. For comparison, PLT-I and PLT-O were determined on the Sysmex XN2000 and Sysmex XE2100 analyzer. Blood samples with platelet counts less than 50 × 10(3)/μL (50 × 10(9)/L) (n = 37) were analyzed on the Sysmex XN2000 and XE2100 analyzers. The CD61-ImmunoPLT method was performed on a Beckman Coulter FC-500 flow cytometer (Miami, FL). At a platelet count of 20 × 10(3)/μL (20 × 10(9)/L), reproducibility for PLT-I, PLT-O, and PLT-F on the XN2000 demonstrated coefficients of variation of 9.3%, 8.5%, and 3.0%, respectively. Correlation between PLT-O on the XN2000 and XE2100 yielded an r value of more than 0.977. Linear regression analysis between the PLT-F and CD61-ImmunoPLT methods resulted in a PLT-F of 0.71*CD61 - 0.8 (r = 0.988). Linear regression between PLT-F and PLT-O on the XN2000 resulted in a PLT-F of 1.05*PLT-O - 2 (r = 0.975), and using the transfusion threshold of 20 × 10(9)/L platelets resulted in a PLT-F of 0.90*PLT-O - 0.4 (r = 0.956). The new PLT-F method demonstrated excellent results for reproducibility in samples with platelet counts less than 50 × 10(9)/L. PLT-F could be helpful in making better decisions for platelet transfusions.},

ABM and the control treatment were equally effective in reducing the symptoms of PTSD. The effect sizes of the improvement (from before to after treatment) were 0.66 for ABM and 0.46 for the control treatment, which is comparable to the effect sizes of pill-placebos in pharmacotherapy trials of chronic PTSD.

In this study inflammation markers and hepcidin-25 concentrations were monitored together with short-term alterations in reticulocyte hemoglobinization (RET-He). A total of 25 patients with CAP participated in the study. The assay for serum hepcidin-25 is based on a combination of weak cation exchange chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. At hospital admission serum hepcidin-25 concentrations (14.6 ± 6.9 nMol/L, mean ± SD) were established in the upper level of the reference range (0.5-13.9 nMol/L). Results for C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were obviously increased compared to the reference ranges. From admission until day 14 hepcidin-25, CRP and IL-6 steadily decreased towards the reference ranges. Hb concentrations declined from admission until day 4 from 8.1 ± 1.0 mMol/L to 7.4 ± 0.9 mMol/L. At admission Ret-He results were within the lower region of the reference range (1900-2300aMol) and results demonstrated a decline during admission from 1931 ± 241 aMol until 1845 ± 199 aMol (NS) at day 4. From a minimum Ret-He value at day 4 results increased towards 2129 ± 136 aMol at day14. A transient increase of cytokine-stimulated serum hepcidin-25 in combination with a temporary decrease of Hb and Ret-He is demonstrated in patients with CAP. Our results support the hypothesis that hepcidin-25 induces transient impairment of reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-He).},

Recent studies in healthy participants suggest that attentional control (AC) may facilitate inhibition of automatic attentional processes associated with anxiety. To investigate relationships among AC, trauma-related AB, symptom severity and trait anxiety in patients with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), participants (N = 91) completed self-report measures of AC, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and trait anxiety. AB was measured with a pictorial version of the Dot Probe Test. AC moderated the relationship between PTSS and AB (threat avoidance). Patients high in PTSS and low in AC showed attentional avoidance. No association between PTSS and AB in patients with medium or high levels of AC was found. A similar pattern of results was observed for the relationship between trait anxiety, AC and AB. These results suggest that a low ability to control attention is a risk factor for AB in PTSD. This first clinical study corroborates the accumulating evidence from analog studies that individual differences in top-down attentional control are of considerable importance in the expression of AB in anxious psychopathology.},

However, no single marker or combination of tests is optimal for discrimination between iron-deficiency anemia and thalassemia. This is the reason why many algorithms have been introduced. However, application of conventional algorithms, only resulted in appropriate classification of 30-40% of subjects. In this mini-review the efficacy of innovative hematological parameters for detection of alterations in RBCs has been considered. It refers to parameters concerning hemoglobinization of RBCs and reticulocytes and the percentages microcytic and hypochromic RBCs, for discrimination between subjects with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) or thalassemia as well as a combination of both. A new discriminating tool including the above mentioned parameters was developed, based on two precondition steps and discriminating algorithms. The percentage microcytic RBCs is considered in the first precondition step. MCV, RDW-SD and RBC count are applied in the second precondition step. Subsequently, new algorithms, including conventional as well as innovative hematological parameters, were assessed for subgroups with microcytic erythropoiesis. The new algorithms for IDA discrimination yielded results for sensitivity of 79%, specificity of 97%, positive and negative predictive values of 74% and 98% respectively. The algorithms for β-thalassemia discrimination revealed similar results (74%, 98%, 75% and 99% respectively). We advocate that innovative algorithms, including parameters reflecting hemoglobinization of RBCs and reticulocytes, are integrated in an easily accessible software program linked to the hematology equipment to improve the discrimination between IDA and thalassemia.},

In this study, 2011 samples were evaluated on a Sysmex XN2000 analyser and microscopically reviewed using a CellaVision DM96 digital microscope. A reference group of apparently healthy blood donors (n = 262) demonstrated in only three samples a positive suspect flag, which could not be confirmed microscopically. Positive WBC suspect flags were demonstrated in 3% of the 2011 samples. From the 55 samples with positive WBC suspect flags, an automatic reflex test was performed within the WPC. The WPC reflex test resulted in 10× Blast?, 15× Abnormal lymph? and 15× Atypical lymph? flags, which could be confirmed microscopically in 33% of these cases. A negative flagging was demonstrated in 15 cases. Microscopic evaluation demonstrated no abnormalities in these 15 cases. However, laboratory technicians also reported the presence of abnormal lymphocytes in 158 samples without an Abnormal lymph? flag. In conclusion, the combined use of WDF and WPC resulted in a reduction of approximately 25% of the number blood smears. As a result of the various techniques for light microscopy and haemocytometry, the adequacy of the XN flagging for abnormal and atypical lymphocytes cannot be established with certainty. To improve the quality of the reported results, it is recommended that laboratory technicians incorporate the haemocytometry results and the flagging information in the microscopic slide review.},

In practice, verification is limited to comparison with the previously used equipment and determination of reproducibilities. Particularly in multicenter settings, harmonization of results is necessary. If the same equipment is used in several laboratory departments, calibration and uniformity are important issues. In this study, seven Sysmex XN hematology modules distributed over three laboratories were evaluated with the same set of samples (n=160). Results of each Sysmex XN hematology module were compared with the results of the Sysmex XE-2100 hematology analyzer using linear regression. Although excellent correlation coefficients were obtained, in many cases the criteria for slope and/or intercept were not met. Therefore, the same data were analyzed with Bland-Altman difference plots with three times the specified CV% of the parameter as limits of agreement. At least 90% of the determinations per parameter and per module must comply with those limits of agreement. Almost all parameters on each module fulfilled these criteria, and only RBC and Ht from respectively two and four XN modules had to be recalibrated. Reproducibility of each parameter was determined 10 times in patient samples with low, normal, and high levels. Reproducibility of all parameters was within the specifications of the manufacturer and the biological variability. With this straightforward method, all seven Sysmex XN hematology modules demonstrated uniform results, which were identical to those of the previously used Sysmex XE-2100 hematology analyzer, the performance of which was well known.},

After assessing haematological parameters and zinc protoporphyrin/heme ratio as marker for IDE, subjects were classified into a group with symptoms of IDE (n = 39) or without IDE (n = 106). The subjects with IDE (n = 39) were treated with iron supplementation. After 4 weeks effects of treatment were evaluated. In the group of pregnant women with IDE results of %MicroR and %Hypo-He were increased (p = <.001), compared to the group without haematological symptoms of IDE, whereas RET-He, RBC-He and delta-He were decreased (p = <.001). A significant positive correlation to increased values of %MicroR (r = .75, p = <.001) and %Hypo-He (r = .77, p = <.001) with ZPP was established. However, in the ZPP interval 75-100 μmol/mol heme a slight overlap was demonstrated between subjects with and without symptoms of IDE. After iron supplementation, %Hypo-He decreased (p = .002) while %MicroR remained stable. RET-He, delta-He and RDW-SD increased (p = <.001). The added value of %MicroR and %Hypo-He as a single marker for IDE is poor.

In 11 patients, IL-6, CRP and sPLA(2) levels were assessed in blood samples drawn before (t(0)), at the end (t(180)) and 24 h after the start of HD (t(1440)). All patients were dialysed on Cuprammonium (CU) and Polysulphon (PS) dialysers and seven patients underwent an additional HD session on CU plus a dialysate filter (CUf). IL-6 levels were increased significantly at t(180) compared with t(0) (P<0.02) with both CU and CUf. At t(1440), IL-6 levels had returned to baseline. In contrast, marked fluctuations did not occur during HD with PS. At t(180), IL-6 was significantly greater with CU and CUf devices, than with PS (P<0.02). Following HD with CU and CUf, a significant increase in CRP was observed at t(1440), compared with postdialysis values (P</=0.05). In addition, sPLA(2) values were markedly increased at t(1440), compared with t(180), but only significant in the case of CU (P=0.01). IL-6 levels at t(180) were significantly correlated with CRP (r=0.50, P<0.01) and sPLA(2) (r=0.47, P=0.01) values at t(1440). During HD with PS membranes, neither CRP nor sPLA(2) values were markedly changed. In contrast to PS, both CU and CUf resulted in elevated IL-6 plasma levels at the end of HD, compared with t(0), which correlated with increased CRP and sPLA(2) values 24 h later. Therefore, the type of membrane, rather than the bacterial quality of the dialysate, seems to be responsible for the induction of the acute phase response during clinical bicarbonate HD.},

  abstract = {Monocyte activation and subsequent cytokine generation is presumed to be involved in haemodialysis (HD)-related morbidity. The present study was designed to investigate HD-induced changes in monocytes, with respect to their phenotypic profile and cytokine release, both in peripheral blood (PB) and dialyser eluates (DE). In addition, the effect of the type of dialyser on monocyte activation was assessed. Dialyser elution was performed in 8 patients after 3 h of HD, using cuprammonium (CU) and polysulfon (PS) dialysers in a randomised cross-over design. PB samples and DE were analysed for both the expression of a variety of monocyte cell surface markers (CD62L, CD11b, CD25, HLA-DR, CD64 and CD14) by flow cytometry and IL-1beta levels. Monocytes were identified by dual labelling with antibodies against CD14. In PB, the expression of CD11b increased during HD with both devices, but was more pronounced with CU (CU versus PS: p < 0.05). CD62L decreased during HD, but only significantly for PS (p < 0.02). HLA-DR was downregulated during HD with CU (p = 0.056). The expression of CD64 was higher during HD with CU (p = 0.02). Finally, CD14 increased during HD with both dialysers (p < 0.03). DE yielded a mean cell count of 51 x 10(6) cells. The proportion of monocytes in DE was 3% for CU and 4% for PS. In eluted monocytes, a significant upregulation of CD11b, CD25, and HLA-DR was observed. CD62L was downregulated when compared to PB at t(180) (p < 0.001). In DE, no correlation was found between the type of dialyser and the phenotypic changes. In 10 of 16 DE supernatants, 6 CU and 4 PS, IL-1beta release could be demonstrated, CU yielding significantly more of this cytokine than PS (p = 0.03). According to both their phenotypic profile and cytokine release, monocytes sticking to the dialyser membrane after HD are considerably more activated than circulating monocytes. Activation of eluted monocytes appeared independent of the type of dialyser, suggesting an effect of mechanical stress rather than bioincompatibility. In contrast, phenotypic activation of peripheral blood monocytes and cytokine release in the DE supernatant were mainly dialyser-dependent.},

  abstract = {The MY-3F [Fit & Fun with Football after myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery disease (CAD)] study was the first to investigate whether a structured and health-adapted football training programme can improve fitness and risk factors in patients with CAD and whether it is safe. The primary objective of this study was to improve fitness in maximum oxygen uptake in spiroergometry (VO2peak), blood pressure, weight, and safety. The MY-3F study is a prospective randomized interventional study with 1-year follow-up in patients with MI or CAD. A football group (FG, n = 89) completed a structured 'health' football training (1 h/week, 75 min) led by licensed football coaches. The results were compared with a control group (CG, n = 88). VO2peak in the FG significantly increased from 18.0 to 19.7 mL/min/kg (P < 0.001), and VO2peak in the CG significantly decreased from 19.5 to 18.3 mL/min/kg (P = 0.046). In the FG, running performance per participant per training improved from 1.8 km at admission to 2.4 km at the end of study (P < 0.001). In the FG, blood pressure decreased from 132/81 to 125/76 mmHg (P < 0.001). In the CG, it changed slightly from 137/82 to 136/82 mmHg (ns). In addition, a significantly more antihypertensives were given in CG, but not in FB. In the FG, weight decreased from 92.3 to 90.4 kg (P = 0.003). In the CG, it increased slightly from 90.7 to 91 kg (P = 0.6 ns). Depressive symptoms showed a significant improvement in the FG (P = 0.034), but no changes were observed in the CG. There was no significant change in LDL cholesterol in both groups, but significantly more lipid-lowering therapy was administered in the CG (P = 0.049). In My-3F, the preventive benefit on CVRF (cardiovascular risk factors) and fitness of football training in patients after MI or CAD was clearly demonstrated for the first time. The concept proved to be safe and cost-effective and could open the doors of football clubs to evidence-based cardiological prevention.},

The present study evaluates the predictive value of a prostate specific antigen (PSA) increase to PSA 3.0 ng/ml or greater in a 4-year period in men who present with low PSA values (less than 3.0 ng/ml) at first screen. A total of 42,376 men were randomized to screening vs control in Rotterdam. Of 6,467 men 5,771 had PSA values of less than 3.0 ng/ml, did not undergo biopsy at baseline and were rescreened after 4 years with PSA 3.0 ng/ml or greater as biopsy indication. PSA progression in a 4-year interscreening interval is evaluated by determining the positive predictive values, detection rates and parameters of aggressiveness of round 2 cancers. PSA progression to more than 3.0 ng/ml occurred in 0.9%, 9.3% and 48.6% of men who presented with PSA values less than 1.0, 1 to 1.9 and 2 to 2.9 ng/ml, respectively, in round 1. Their respective positive predictive values amounted to 19.0%, 23.8% and 27.9%. Cancer detection rates increased with increasing PSA values in round 1. The distribution of low, moderate and high risk cancers depends on round 2 but not on round 1 PSA ranges. PSA progression to the (arbitrary) cutoff value of 3.0 ng/ml and the diagnosis of prostate cancer in round 2 screening with a 4-year interval depends strongly on PSA values at the time of the 1st screen. These observations will be helpful to design future screening procedures. With levels less than 2.0 ng/ml PSA progression to levels of 3.0 ng/ml or greater is rare as it was seen only in 4.8% of all men.},

  abstract = {Hyperlipidemia enhances xanthine oxidase (XO) activity. XO is an important source of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since ROS are thought to promote atherosclerosis, we hypothesized that XO is involved in the development of atherosclerosis. ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a Western-type (WD) or control diet. In subgroups, tungsten (700 mg/L) was administered to inhibit XO. XO is a secreted enzyme which is formed in the liver as xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and binds to the vascular endothelium. High expression of XDH was found in the liver and WD increased liver XDH mRNA and XDH protein expression. WD induced the conversion of XDH to the radical-forming XO. Moreover, WD increased the hepatic expression of CD40, demonstrating activation of hepatic cells. Aortic tissue of ApoE(-/-) mice fed a WD for 6 months exhibited marked atherosclerosis, attenuated endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, increased vascular oxidative stress, and mRNA expression of the chemokine KC. Tungsten treatment had no effect on plasma lipids but lowered the plasma XO activity. In animals fed a control diet, tungsten had no effect on radical formation, endothelial function, or atherosclerosis development. In mice fed a WD, however tungsten attenuated the vascular superoxide anion formation, prevented endothelial dysfunction, and attenuated KC mRNA expression. Most importantly, tungsten treatment largely prevented the development of atherosclerosis in the aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice on WD. Therefore, tungsten, potentially via the inhibition of XO, prevents the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice on WD.},

In such circumstances, video-assisted guidance by the dispatcher has been demonstrated to be advantageous for the recognition of cardiac arrest and the improvement of CPR quality. The present study investigates the effectiveness of a brief training program for control center dispatchers in the recognition of common errors during simulated resuscitation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and registered at the German Clinical Trial Register on 27th of February 2024 (Registration number: DRKS00032661) prior to inclusion of the first participant. Within a two-armed group study design, paramedics and emergency physicians were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 44) or a control group (n = 44). The experimental group was initially exposed to a targeted brief training aimed at enhancing the recognition of excessively deep chest compression depth. All participants evaluated 42 distinct video sequences showing seven typical errors during CPR. The shown CPRs were simulated on a training manikin and the videos were evaluated by the participants under laboratory conditions. The primary endpoint was the accurate evaluation of the presented videos with too deep compression depth in a laboratory setting. A total of 3696 video sequences were evaluated. The experimental group demonstrated a significantly higher recognition rate for too deep chest compressions compared to the control group (87.9% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001). With regard to the remaining errors, no significant differences were observed between the study groups. Overall, 2861 of the 3696 videos (77.7%) were correctly classified. The proportion of correctly classified videos was significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group (79.8% vs. 75.6%, p = 0.003), indicating a statistically significant effect of the intervention. The identification of chest compressions with too deep compression depth in a video of simulated CPR was found to increase significantly in evaluators who had undergone a brief training course. The trial was registered in the German Clinical Trial Register "BfArM - Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien (DRKS)" under the registration number DRKS00032661.},

The aim of this study is to analyze long-term outcomes following mitral valve replacement in children in a tertiary referral center. A total of 41 consecutive patients underwent mitral valve replacement between February 2001 and February 2021. The study data was prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, long-term survival, and long-term freedom from reoperation. Median age at operation was 23 months (IQR 5-93), median weight was 11.3 kg (IQR 4.8-19.4 kg). One (2.4%) patient died within the first 30 postoperative days. In-hospital mortality was 4.9%. Four (9.8%) patients required re-exploration for bleeding, and 2 (4.9%) patients needed extracorporeal life support. Median follow-up was 11 years (IQR 11 months - 16 years). Long-term freedom from re-operation after 1, 5, 10 and 15 years was 97.1%, 93.7%, 61.8% and 42.5%, respectively.

The prospective questionnaire study included physicians participating in intensive care and emergency medicine courses and nurses who were training or working in intensive and emergency care. Self-reported spiritual competencies were assessed using the Spiritual Care Competence Questionnaire (SCCQ), which captures the following areas: perceptual competence, team-spirit, documentation competence, self-awareness and proactive opening, knowledge about other religions, competence in conversation techniques and proactive empowerment-competence. We included 465 physicians (50% female, years in profession: mean = 4.0, standard deviation [SD] = 3.5) and 86 nurses (80% female, years in profession: mean = 12.7, SD = 10.7). The average SCC was 2.3 (SD 0.4) out of a maximum of 4 points, with higher spiritual competences among spiritual and religious respondents. There were differences in specific competencies between the professions and genders. Women indicated a higher level of competence in the area of perception and conversation skills, physicians in documentation skills.

There are gaps in the knowledge of the participating members of the DGP regarding the legal and professional status of assisted suicide. Further educational work is needed in this regard. The participants can more easily imagine assisted suicide for people in palliative disease trajectories. As in surveys of members of other medical societies, the attitudes of more experienced staff are reflected.

There was a significant demographic transition, with the proportion of male patients rising from 10% to 15% (P = 0.003). Although apical TTS remained the most common form, the diagnosis of midventricular TTS increased from 18% to 28% (P = 0.018). The prevalence of physical triggers increased from 39% to 58% over the years (P < 0.001). There was a significant increase in 60-day mortality over the years (P < 0.001). However, a landmark analysis excluding patients who died within the first 60 days showed no differences in 1-year mortality (P = 0.150). This study of temporal trends in TTS highlights a transition in patients demographic with a growing prevalence among men, increasing recognition of midventricular TTS type, and increased short-term mortality and rates of cardiogenic shock in recent years. This transition aligns with the rising prevalence of physical triggers, as expression of increased recognition of TTS in association with acute comorbidities.},

  abstract = {Chronic exposure to glucocorticoids (GCs) can lead to psychiatric complications through epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAm). We sought to determine whether epigenetic changes in a peripheral tissue can serve as a surrogate for those in a relatively inaccessible tissue such as the brain. DNA extracted from the hippocampus and blood of mice treated with GCs or vehicle solution was assayed using a genome-wide DNAm platform (Methyl-Seq) to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) induced by GC treatment. We observed that ∼70% of the DMRs in both tissues lost methylation following GC treatment. Of the 3,095 DMRs that mapped to the same genes in both tissues, 1,853 DMRs underwent DNAm changes in the same direction. Interestingly, only 209 DMRs (<7%) overlapped in genomic coordinates between the 2 tissues, suggesting tissue-specific differences in GC-targeted loci. Pathway analysis showed that the DMR-associated genes were members of pathways involved in metabolism, immune function, and neurodevelopment. Also, changes in cell type composition of blood and brain were examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Separation of the cortex into neuronal and non-neuronal fractions and the leukocytes into T-cells, B-cells, and neutrophils showed that GC-induced methylation changes primarily occurred in neurons and T-cells, with the blood tissue also undergoing a shift in the proportion of constituent cell types while the proportion of neurons and glia in the brain remained stable. From the current pilot study, we found that despite tissue-specific epigenetic changes and cellular heterogeneity, blood can serve as a surrogate for GC-induced changes in the brain.},

Induction of senescence in HSCs may be a promising strategy to slow down, stop, or even reverse fibrogenesis. Senescence is a complex and heterogeneous process linked to fibrosis and cancer, but the exact mechanism and relevant markers can be cell-type dependent. Therefore, many markers of senescence have been proposed, and many methods to detect senescence have been developed. In this chapter, we review relevant methods and biomarkers to detect cellular senescence in hepatic stellate cells.},

The importance of H-NS oligomerization is indicated by the fact that with an extended hns promoter construct (400 bp), which allows protein oligomerization, DNA binding and transcriptional repression are highly and almost equally efficient with native H-NS and H-NSctd::lambdaCI and much less effective with the monomeric H-NSctd. With a shorter (110 bp) construct, which does not sustain extensive protein oligomerization, transcriptional repression is less effective, but native H-NS, H-NSctd::lambdaCI, and monomeric H-NSctd have comparable activity on this construct. The specific H-NS-DNA interaction was investigated by NMR spectroscopy using monomeric H-NSctd and short DNA duplexes encompassing the H-NS target sequence of hns (TCCTTACATT) with the best fit (8 of 10 residues) to the H-NS-binding motif. H-NSctd binds specifically and with high affinity to the chosen duplexes via an overall electropositive surface involving four residues (Thr(109), Arg(113), Thr(114), and Ala(116)) belonging to the same protein loop and Glu(101). The DNA target is recognized by virtue of its sequence and of a TpA step that confers a structural irregularity to the B-DNA duplex.},

To ensure that high-priority services are available equitably within and across the European countries, a shared set of prioritization criteria would be desirable. A decision process following the accountability for reasonableness framework was undertaken, including a multidisciplinary EuroGentest/PPPC-ESHG workshop to develop shared prioritization criteria. Resources are currently too limited to fund all the beneficial genetic testing services available in the next decade. Ethically and economically reflected prioritization criteria are needed. Prioritization should be based on considerations of medical benefit, health need and costs. Medical benefit includes evidence of benefit in terms of clinical benefit, benefit of information for important life decisions, benefit for other people apart from the person tested and the patient-specific likelihood of being affected by the condition tested for. It may be subject to a finite time window. Health need includes the severity of the condition tested for and its progression at the time of testing. Further discussion and better evidence is needed before clearly defined recommendations can be made or a prioritization algorithm proposed. To our knowledge, this is the first time a clinical society has initiated a decision process about health-care prioritization on a European level, following the principles of accountability for reasonableness. We provide points to consider to stimulate this debate across the EU and to serve as a reference for improving patient management.},

All participants participated in a physical activity promotion programme in Dutch rehabilitation care. HR-QoL was assessed using the RAND-12 Health Status Inventory questionnaire at baseline (T0: 3-6 weeks before discharge) and at 14 (T1), 33 (T2) and 52 (T3) weeks after discharge from rehabilitation. A data-driven approach using Latent Class Growth Mixture modelling was used to determine HR-QoL trajectories. Multiple binomial multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine person-, disease- and lifestyle-related factors associated with trajectory membership. Three HR-QoL trajectories were identified: moderate (N = 635), high (N = 429) and recovery (N = 36). Trajectory membership was associated with person-related factors (age and body mass index), disease-related factors (perceived fatigue, perceived pain and acceptance of the disease) and one lifestyle-related factor (alcohol consumption) before discharge from rehabilitation. Most of the people who participated in a physical activity promotion programme obtained a relatively stable but moderate HR-QoL. The identified HR-QoL trajectories among our heterogeneous cohort are disease-overarching. Our findings suggest that people in rehabilitation may benefit from person-centred advice on management of fatigue and pain (e.g. activity pacing) and the acceptance of the disability.},

  abstract = {Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is commonly performed for shoulder osteoarthritis (OA). Uncemented metal-backed (MB) glenoid components were introduced in an attempt to avoid glenoid loosening. New Zealand and Australian Joint Registry studies have shown significantly higher revision rates when uncemented MB glenoids are used. We used the New Zealand Joint Registry (NZJR) to compare all-cause revision rates and functional scores for TSA and investigated the trends of glenoid fixation used in New Zealand. The NZJR was accessed for all primary TSA undertaken for OA from January 2000 to December 2017. Patient demographics were collated. All-cause revision rates were reported as rate per 100 component-years. Analysis was repeated excluding the uncemented SMR L2 glenoid (LimaCorporate), as it was a potential confounder. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Oxford Shoulder Scores at both 6 months and 5 years were analyzed. A total of 2613 TSAs were performed for OA during the study period, representing 85.0% of all TSAs in New Zealand. Overall, 62.1% of the patients were female. In addition, 69.6% of glenoids were cemented and 30.4% uncemented. The most common uncemented MB glenoid was SMR 86.6% (LimaCorporate), and cemented was Global (DePuy) 49.8%. The revision rate for TSA with uncemented glenoids was significantly higher at 2.03 compared with cemented at 0.41 per 100 component-years (P < .001). Hazard ratio 5.0 for revision of uncemented glenoids. No significant difference was found in Oxford Scores at 6 months (39.7 vs. 40.3, P = .13) or 5 years (42.1 vs. 42.8, P = .22). The most common mode of failure was glenoid loosening in cemented glenoids (44.4%), and component failure in uncemented (34.8%). Revision for rotator cuff, deep infection, and instability were comparable between groups. When excluding SMR L2, uncemented MB glenoid all-cause revision rates remained significantly higher than cemented (1.42 vs. 0.41 per 100 component-years, P < .001). SMR L1 uncemented MB glenoids had a higher revision rate than the non-SMR uncemented glenoids (1.61 vs. 0.18 per 100 component-years, P = .009). Uncemented glenoid use peaked in New Zealand in 2011 at 46.7% of TSAs but declined to 20.1% in 2017. In the NZJR, primary TSAs undertaken for OA have a significantly higher all-cause revision rate when the glenoid component is uncemented. Uncemented glenoids have a 5.0 times higher revision rate. Excluding SMR L2 glenoids from the analysis, the significantly higher revision rate remained for uncemented glenoids. These data reaffirm that uncemented MB glenoids are associated with higher revision rates.},

Descriptive anatomic study. Ten knees from 8 cadavers were dissected and the PCL was identified. The ligament was peeled away from its insertion and the sides of the insertion site were measured and recorded. The 4 corners of the insertion site were identified and marked. Observations were made of the morphology of the insertion site and the presence of any reproducible anatomic landmarks. A note was made of landmarks that could be easily identified on all of the specimens by direct vision and by palpation with a probe. The ligament consisted of 2 regions, 1 anterolateral, and 1 posteromedial, with a gradual change in the laxity of the ligament as the knee was passed through flexion and extension. The insertion site was situated in a depression between the plateaus of the tibia and extended below the articular surface. The average length +/- standard deviation of the 4 sides was 128 +/- 21.2 mm (medial side), 107 +/- 26.5 mm (superior side), 160 +/- 30.0 mm (lateral side), and 169 +/- 34.5 mm (inferior side). The shape and sides of the insertion site were visually similar among the 10 specimens. The superolateral and superomedial corners were both represented by depressions and a reproducible ridge represented the inferior border. These structures could be visualized as well as palpated on all specimens. Based on the findings of this study, we describe the anatomic characteristics of the tibial footprint of the PCL. Anatomic reference points that represent the corners of the tibial insertion of the PCL were identified by direct vision or palpation consistently on all specimens included in the study. These reference points could potentially aid in the placement of an anterolateral and posteromedial tibial tunnel for a 2 tibial tunnel PCL reconstruction. Reproducible anatomic reference points exist at the tibial insertion of the PCL that can be identified by direct vision and palpation. These reference points may potentially aid in the placement of separate tibial tunnels for a 2-bundle PCL reconstruction.},

The management of these rare and complex injuries can be challenging from initial presentation through definitive management. Timely diagnosis of these injuries is critical to prevent devastating complications, yet the diagnosis is often delayed. Delays in surgery and poor fracture reduction are associated with a high risk of complications such as avascular necrosis. Additionally, these injuries have the potential to be irreducible. This may occur secondary to osteochondral humeral defects, soft tissue interposition, or entrapment. The long head of the biceps tendon incarceration is one potential block to reduction. Definitive surgical treatment options include open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and shoulder arthroplasty. While reoperation rates are higher in patients undergoing ORIF, arthroplasty longevity is a concern among young, active patients with high functional demands. Fibular strut allograft is a useful adjunct when reconstructing complex proximal humerus fractures. We present a case of a 28-year-old male who sustained a significantly comminuted four-part left proximal humerus fracture with an irreducible posterior humeral head dislocation requiring urgent ORIF following a motor vehicle accident.},

Our physiological studies require repeated measurements of vascular structure to determine differences in vessel biomechanical properties between animal models of pulmonary disease. Automation provides many advantages including significantly improved speed and minimized operator interaction and biasing.

Mean persistence was defined in months from treatment initiation to cessation. Four thousand six hundred eighty-eight of 5796 total PALLAS participants were included. Across all cycles, mean daily ET adherence values measured by study diary were > 98.0% and did not differ between treatment arms. Mean persistence to ET was similar between arms (19.2 months for palbociclib + ET vs. 19.6 months for ET alone). However, patient-reported maximal ET adherence was higher across time for palbociclib + ET compared to ET alone (p ≤ 0.0001, modified MMAS-4; p = 0.05, McHorney). In the PALLAS trial, addition of palbociclib did not decrease adherence to adjuvant ET. Though numbers declined over time, daily adherence for palbociclib and ET remained relatively high at each cycle.

This study aimed to apply behavior change theory to understand and support researchers' adoption of a research partnership approach and the Integrated Knowledge Translation (IKT) Guiding Principles for conducting and disseminating spinal cord injury (SCI) research in partnership. Using an IKT approach, SCI researchers across Canada and the USA completed a survey (n = 22) and were interviewed (n = 13) to discuss barriers and facilitators to deciding to partner and follow the IKT Guiding Principles. The Behaviour Change Wheel, Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), and Mode of Delivery Ontology were used to develop the survey, interview questions, and guided analyses of interview data. COM-B and TDF factors were examined using descriptive statistics and abductive analyses of barriers and facilitators of decisions to partner and/or use the IKT Guiding Principles. TDF domains from the interview transcripts were then used to identify intervention, content, and implementation options. 142 factors (79 barriers, 63 facilitators) related to deciding to partner, and 292 factors (187 barriers, 105 facilitators) related to deciding to follow the IKT Guiding Principles were identified. Barriers to partnering or use the IKT Guiding Principles were primarily related to capability and opportunity and relevant intervention options were recommended. Interventions must support researchers in understanding how to partner and use the IKT Guiding Principles while navigating a research system, which is not always supportive of the necessary time and costs required for meaningful research partnerships.},

  abstract = {Integrated knowledge translation (IKT) is a partnered approach to research that aims to ensure research findings are applied in practice and policy. IKT can be used during diffusion and dissemination of research findings. However, there is a lack of understanding how an IKT approach can support the diffusion and dissemination of research findings. In this study, we documented and described the processes and outcomes of an IKT approach to diffusing and disseminating the findings of consensus recommendations for conducting spinal cord injury research. Communication of the IKT Guiding Principles in two phases: a diffusion phase during the first 102 days from the manuscript's publication, followed by a 1147 day active dissemination phase. A record of all inputs was kept and all activities were tracked by monitoring partnership communication, a partnership tracking survey, a project curriculum vitae, and team emails. Awareness outcomes were tracked through Google Analytics and a citation-forward search. Awareness includes the website accesses, the number of downloads, and the number of citations in the 29 month period following publication. In the diffusion period, the recommendations were viewed 60 times from 4 different countries, and 4 new downloads. In the dissemination period, the recommendations were viewed 1109 times from 39 different countries, 386 new downloads, and 54 citations. Overall, during dissemination there was a 17.5% increase in new visitors to the website a month and a 95.5% increase in downloads compared to diffusion. This project provides an overview of an IKT approach to diffusion and dissemination. Overall, IKT may be helpful for increasing awareness of research findings faster; however, more research is needed to understand best practices and the the impact of an IKT approach on the diffusion and dissemination versus a non-partnered approach.},

Our NMR analyses indicate virtually identical structures but reveal remarkable differences in local dynamics, with striking correspondence between experimental data (i.e., (15)N relaxation and H/D exchange rates) and data from Molecular Dynamics simulations. While overall the cores of both proteins are very rigid on the pico- to nanosecond timescale and are largely protected from H/D exchange, the two point mutations stabilize helices alpha1, alpha4, and alpha5 and locally destabilize the H-bond network of the beta-sheet (beta7-beta9). In particular, it emerges that helix alpha5, undergoing some fast destabilizing motions (on the pico- to nanosecond timescale) in wild-type lipase, is substantially rigidified by the mutation of Phe180 for a proline at its N terminus. This observation could be explained by the release of some penalizing strain, as proline does not require any "N-capping" hydrogen bond acceptor in the i+3 position. The combined experimental and simulated data thus indicate that reduced molecular flexibility of the F180P/S205G mutant lipase underlies its increased stability, and thus reveals a correlation between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic thermodynamic properties. This could contribute to the observed altered enzyme activity, as may be inferred from recent studies linking enzyme kinetics to their local molecular dynamics.},

We invited 2155 recipients of 1153 funded projects to answer a questionnaire probing project characteristics and perceptions of partnered health research. We described and compared perceived effects of involving knowledge users in the project, team cohesion, capability, opportunity and motivation for working in partnership between two categories of respondents: project role [nominated principal investigators (NPIs), other researchers and knowledge users] and gender. We analysed data from 589 respondents (42% NPIs, 40% other researchers and 18% knowledge users; 56% women). Among the perceived effects variables, the proportion of ratings of significant influence of involving knowledge users in the project ranged between 12% and 63%. Cohesion, capability, opportunity and motivation variables ranged between 58% and 97% agreement. There were no significant differences between respondent groups for most variables. NPIs and women rated the overall influence of involving knowledge users as significant more than other respondent groups (p < 0.001). NPIs also reported higher agreement with feeling sufficiently included in team activities, pressure to engage and partnerships enabling personal goals (all p < 0.001). Most respondents held positive perceptions of working in partnership, although ratings of perceived effects indicated limited effects of involving knowledge users in specific research components and on project outcomes. Continued analysis of project outcomes may identify specific contexts and partnership characteristics associated with greater impact.},

We sought to establish a high-throughput approach for echocardiography-guided induction of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (IR) in mice. After visualization of the left coronary artery with high-resolution ultrasound imaging and echocardiographic definition of the level of coronary occlusion, the left anterior descending artery was temporarily occluded with 2 micromanipulator-controlled needles. Functional and molecular changes were assessed and compared with commonly performed surgical techniques. Echocardiography-guided induction of myocardial IR enabled standardized induction of myocardial IR injury with subsequent left ventricular remodeling. Incorporation of various quality control measures throughout the procedure ensured a high success rate and the absence of relevant postinterventional mortality in experienced hands. Compared with surgical approaches, echocardiography-guided induction of myocardial IR showed a quicker recovery time and induced a less pronounced inflammatory response characterized by decreased local and systemic neutrophil counts. Notably, infarct size and subsequent post-myocardial infarction cardiac dysfunction were comparable between methods. The novel procedure was successfully implemented at different academic institutions with imaging expertise and demonstrated high interinstitutional reproducibility. Echocardiography-guided induction of myocardial IR enables high-throughput induction of myocardial IR injury with precise echocardiographic definition of the occlusion level and immediate evaluation of cardiac function during ischemia. The method provides a more clinically relevant assessment of IR sequelae and offers notable animal welfare advantages by eliminating the need for ventilation and thoracotomy, thereby mitigating potential surgery-related confounders.},

Periventricular leukomalacia occurred in 73 children, in 82% after a history of subacute or chronic hypoxia-ischemia, in 71% after preterm birth. Predominant lesions of basal ganglia and thalamus occurred in 21 children, in 95% preceded by acute profound asphyxia, in 85% after term birth. Multicystic encephalopathy occurred in 10 infants, in 70% preceded by mild signs of hypoxia-ischemia, followed by an unexpectedly severe encephalopathy, in 60% after term birth. Statistical analysis showed that the patterns of injury were primarily related to the type of hypoxia-ischemia. We conclude that the type of hypoxia-ischemia, rather than the postconceptional age at occurrence determines the pattern of brain injury.},

We reviewed early MR scans of 18 neonates with suspected hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. Myelination could be evaluated with confidence using conventional MR imaging in all but 2 infants; however, the presence of myelin was very difficult to assess on FLAIR images. Overall, 53 lesions or groups of lesions were identified. The FLAIR technique was more sensitive in 11 of the lesions; especially (pre)cystic lesions could be identified much better and more cysts were found. Conventional MR imaging failed to identify 2 of the lesions and was more sensitive in 14 of the lesions; especially punctate hemorrhages and lesions in basal ganglia or thalami could be better determined. The FLAIR technique missed 3 of these lesions. In the remaining 28 lesions conventional MR and FLAIR images were equally diagnostic. The FLAIR technique and conventional MR imaging are complementary in detecting early sequelae of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonates. The FLAIR technique is not suitable for assessing myelination of the neonatal brain; therefore, FLAIR cannot replace conventional MR imaging.},

Our purpose was to investigate the possibility of diagnosing PVL in the acute stage by using MR imaging. We evaluated early MR features of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonates with periventricular densities (flares) on cranial sonograms to determine the added value of MR imaging over sonography alone for early diagnosis of brain damage. In a prospective study, infants who showed flares and/or cysts on sonograms underwent MR imaging during the (sub)acute stage. Fifty infants were classified according to the highest sonographic grade up to the day of MR imaging: 23 infants had sonographic grade 1 (flares < 1 week), 15 had sonographic grade 2 (flares > or = 1 week), four had sonographic grade 3 (small localized cysts), and eight had sonographic grade 4 (extensive periventricular cysts); none had sonographic grade 5 (multicystic leukomalacia) on the day of MR imaging. Overall, the additional information provided by MR imaging (over sonography alone) consisted of the depiction of hemorrhagic lesions in 64% of the infants. Extent and severity of the hemorrhages varied from isolated punctate lesions to extensive hemorrhages throughout the white matter; the latter were followed by cystic degeneration at autopsy in two infants. In nine of the 12 infants with cystic PVL, MR images showed more numerous or more extensive cysts. In addition, in two infants, MR images showed cysts not present on sonograms. In 32% of the infants, MR imaging provided no additional information; in these children, all but one had flares on sonograms whereas MR images showed no abnormalities or a zone of mild periventricular signal change. MR imaging can depict the precise site and extent of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury at an earlier stage and allows a wider differentiation of lesions as compared with sonography alone. Hemorrhagic PVL is considered to be rare, but was present in 64% of our study population.},

A sequential cohort of infants with periventricular densities on neonatal ultrasound was studied with neonatal MRI. Images of 46 infants with a mean gestational age of 31 weeks were obtained at a mean age of 20 days after birth and at 1 1/2 years. To establish agreement between the neonatal and follow-up MRI (general, motor, and visual scores), the weighted Cohen's kappa test was used. To establish the predictive power of neonatal MRI with respect to the neurologic indices at the age of 1 1/2 years, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. There was a moderately good to good agreement between the general, motor, and visual neonatal and follow-up MRI scores: weighted kappa = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.44 - 0.74), 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72 - 0.93), and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 - 0.84), respectively. Neonatal MRI scores provided a good prediction of the three neurological outcome measures (developmental delay, cerebral palsy, and cerebral visual impairment): sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were high, with little difference between the three MRI scores. The 32 patients with (nearly) normal neonatal MRI scores were neurologically (nearly) normal at 1 1/2 years on all three outcome measures, whereas 8 patients with seriously abnormal neonatal MRI scores were neurologically abnormal at 1 1/2 years on all three outcome measures. Neonatal MRI is able to predict the precise localization and size of perinatal leukomalacia on follow-up MRI and provides a good prediction of neurological outcome at 1 1/2 years.},

T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were assessed for changes in signal intensity of white matter relative to gray matter. Multiple sites in the brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres were assessed separately. The findings were correlated with the ages of the infants. As judged from relative signal intensities, myelin was present at the post-conceptional age of 30-34 weeks in the following structures: tegmentum pontis (in particular medial lemniscus), superior and inferior colliculi, decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles, crura cerebri, ventrolateral thalamus, lateral globus pallidus, dorsolateral putamen, dentate nucleus, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, vermis cerebelli, cortex bordering the central sulcus and hippocampus. Little progress in myelination was noticed up to the post-conceptional age of 46 weeks. Between 34 and 46 weeks, myelin appeared in the lateral part of the posterior limb of the internal capsule and in the central part of the corona radiata and became more prominently visible in the cortex bordering the central sulcus.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease, one of the most common causes of death in western populations, is characterized by changes in RNA splicing and expression. Circular RNAs (circRNA) originate from back-splicing events, which link a downstream 5' splice site to an upstream 3' splice site. Several back-splicing junctions (BSJ) have been described in heart biopsies from human, rat and mouse hearts (Werfel et al., 2016; Jakobi et al., 2016 ). Here, we use human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to identify circRNA and host gene dynamics in cardiac development and disease. In parallel, we explore candidate interactions of selected homologs in mouse and rat via RIP-seq experiments. Deep RNA sequencing of cardiomyocyte development and β-adrenergic stimulation uncovered 4518 circRNAs. The set of circular RNA host genes is enriched for chromatin modifiers and GTPase activity regulators. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR data showed that circular RNA expression is highly dynamic in the hiPSC-CM model with 320 circRNAs showing significant expression changes. Intriguingly, 82 circRNAs are independently regulated to their host genes. We validated the same circRNA dynamics for circRNAs from ATXN10, CHD7, DNAJC6 and SLC8A1 in biopsy material from human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and control patients. Finally, we could show that rodent homologs of circMYOD, circSLC8A1, circATXN7 and circPHF21A interact with either the ribosome or Argonaute2 protein complexes. CircRNAs are dynamically expressed in a hiPSC-CM model of cardiac development and stress response. Some circRNAs show similar, host-gene independent expression dynamics in patient samples and may interact with the ribosome and RISC complex. In summary, the hiPSC-CM model uncovered a new signature of potentially disease relevant circRNAs which may serve as novel therapeutic targets.},

Through their constant development, even natural components like hyaluronic acid (HY) have been added to improve both their handling and also their regenerative properties. However, little knowledge exists regarding the consequences of the addition of HY to their biocompatibility and the inflammatory tissue reactions. Thus, the present study was conducted, aiming to analyze the influence of two different amounts of high molecular weight HY (HMWHY), combined with a BBS, on in vitro biocompatibility and in vivo tissue reaction. Established in vitro procedures, using L929 cells, were used for cytocompatibility analyses under the test conditions of DIN EN:ISO 10993-5. For the in vivo part of the study, calvarial defects were created in 20 Wistar rats and subsequently filled with BBS, and BBS combined with two different HMWHY amounts, i.e., BBS + HY(L) and BBS + HY(H). As controls, empty defects were used. Established histological, immunohistochemical, and histomorphometrical methods were applied to analyze the tissue reactions to the three different materials, including the induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages and multinucleated giant cells (BMGCs). The in vitro results showed that none of the materials or compositions caused biological damage to the L929 cells and can be considered to be non-toxic. The in vivo results showed that only the addition of high doses of HY to a biphasic bone substitute significantly decreases the occurrence of pro-inflammatory macrophages (* },

We have developed a mobile health app (Cardiomeds) dedicated to patients with heart failure (HF). This app includes an interactive medication list; daily self-monitoring of symptoms, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate; and educational information on HF delivered through various formats. This study aimed to perform a mixed methods usability study of Cardiomeds. Smartphone users with HF were recruited from the HF outpatient clinic at the University Hospital of Geneva. The usability test was conducted in 2 stages, with modifications made to the app after the first stage to address major usability issues. Each stage required 10 participants to perform 14 tasks, such as entering vital signs, entering a new medication and time of intake, or finding information about HF. Each task was timed, sessions were recorded, and all data were anonymized. After completing the tasks, patients completed the System Usability Scale 10-item questionnaire and answered 5 open questions about their perceptions of Cardiomeds. Twenty patients with HF, 75% (15/20) of whom were men, with a mean age of 55 years, were included in this study. The average time to complete all 14 tasks was 18 (SD 5.7) minutes. Manual medication entry was the most time-consuming task, taking an average of 154.40 (SD 68.08) seconds in the first stage, 103.10 (SD 42.76) seconds in the second stage, and 128 (SD 63) seconds overall. The mean overall success rate was 77% (SD 0.23%) for the first stage and 94% (SD 0.07%) for the second stage. A total of 30% (3/10) of participants in the first stage completed all tasks without any help compared with 50% (5/10) of participants during the second stage. The average System Usability Scale score was 80% (SD 17%), showing a slight increase from 79% (SD 16%) in the first stage to 80% (SD 28%) in the second stage, which qualifies the app as "good" in terms of usability. Between the 2 stages, part of the app interface was redesigned to address the key issues identified in the first stage. Despite these improvements, problems related to guidance were frequent and comprised 36% (8/22) of the problems in the first stage and 40% (6/15) in the second stage. In response to open questions, 85% (17/20) of the participants responded that they would like to use the app when it became available. The usability test indicated that Cardiomeds is a suitable and user-friendly app for patients with HF. The app will be further tested in a randomized clinical trial (2022-00731) after acute HF hospitalization to assess its impact on patients' knowledge about HF, self-care, and quality of life.},

  abstract = {Acute pain after cardiac surgery via median sternotomy is commonly managed with multimodal analgesia, but optimal regional techniques remain uncertain. Superficial parasternal intercostal plane (SPIP) blocks have shown promise for postoperative pain control, with the use of catheters extending these benefits up to three days. This study evaluated the efficacy of single-injection SPIP blocks with liposomal bupivacaine in reducing opioid consumption following cardiac surgery. In this prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial, 100 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery via median sternotomy were randomized to receive bilateral SPIP blocks with either a mixture of bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine or saline placebo prior to incision. The primary outcome was total opioid consumption in oral morphine milligram equivalents (MME) over the first 72 postoperative hours. Secondary outcomes included pain scores, time to extubation, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay and opioid use at 90 days. Total opioid consumption in the first 72 hours was not significantly different between groups (SPIP intervention: 165 (IQR 103-284) MME vs saline placebo: 205 (IQR 145-282) MME, p=0.30). Pain scores, extubation time, ICU and hospital length of stay, and opioid use at 90 days were also similar between groups. No serious adverse events were reported. Preincision bilateral SPIP blocks with a mixture of bupivacaine and liposomal bupivacaine did not significantly reduce opioid consumption or improve postoperative analgesic outcomes compared with saline placebo in cardiac surgical patients. These findings suggest that single-injection SPIP blocks with liposomal bupivacaine may not be as effective as repeated injections or catheters in cardiac surgical patients. Further studies should explore modifications to block techniques such as multilevel injections, the timing of the block relative to surgery, alternative local anesthetics, and strategies specifically targeting chest tube-related pain.

Crystal structures have suggested that this process involves conformational changes in the transmembrane β-barrel of BamA that allow for lateral opening, as well as large overall rearrangements of its periplasmic POTRA domains. Here, we identify local dynamics of the BamA POTRA 5 domain by solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. The protein region undergoing conformational exchange is highly conserved and contains residues critical for interaction with BamD and correct β-barrel assembly in vivo. We show that mutations known to affect the latter processes influence the conformational equilibrium, suggesting that the plasticity of POTRA 5 is related to its interaction with BamD and possibly to substrate binding. Taken together, a view emerges in which local protein plasticity may be critically involved in the different stages of outer membrane protein folding and insertion.},

Comparison of these assignments to solid-state NMR (ssNMR) data obtained on two BamA constructs including the transmembrane domain and one or two soluble POTRA domains suggested that the fold of POTRA domain 5 critically depends on the interface with POTRA 4. Using specific labeling schemes we furthermore obtained ssNMR resonance assignments for residues in the extracellular loop 6 that is known to be crucial for BamA-mediated substrate folding and insertion. Taken together, our data provide novel insights into the conformational stability of membrane-embedded, non-crystalline BamA.},

  abstract = {The self is characterized by an intrinsic temporal component consisting in continuity across time. On the neural level, this temporal continuity manifests in the brain's intrinsic neural timescales (INT) that can be measured by the autocorrelation window (ACW). Recent EEG studies reveal a relationship between resting state ACW and self-consciousness. However, it remains unclear whether ACW exhibits different degrees of task-related changes during self-specific compared to non-self-specific activities. To this end, participants in our study initially recorded an eight-minute autobiographical narrative. Following a resting-state session, participants were presented with their own narrative and the narrative of a stranger while undergoing concurrent EEG recording. Behaviorally, subjects evaluated both of the narratives and indicated their perceptions of positivity or negativity on a moment-to-moment basis by positioning a cursor relative to the center of the computer screen. Our results indicate: (a) greater spatial extension and velocity in the behavioral cursor movement during the self narrative assessment compared to the non-self narrative assessment; and (b) longer neural ACWs in response to the self- compared to the non-self narrative and rest. These findings demonstrate the importance of longer temporal windows in neural activity measured by ACW for self-specificity. More broadly, the results highlight the relevance of temporal continuity for the self on the neural level. Such temporal continuity may, correspondingly, also manifest on the psychological level as a "common currency" between brain and self.},

Non-survivors had higher D-dimer levels (3025 ± 2105 versus 1680 ± 1128 μg/l, p=0.05). None of the 16 patients with D-dimer levels<500 μg/l died. In multivariate analysis D-dimer levels were not associated with clinical outcome. D-dimer levels have poor accuracy for predicting clinical outcome at day 30 (AUC 0.62, 95% CI 0.51-0.73) or 30 day mortality (AUC 0.71 (95% CI 0.51-0.91)). Addition of D-dimer levels to CURB-65 did not increase accuracy. No differences were observed in serial D-dimer levels between patients with clinical success or failure at day 30. D-dimer levels are elevated in patients with CAP. Significantly higher D-dimer levels are found in patients with clinical failure and with severe CAP. D-dimer levels as single biomarker or as addition to the CURB-65 have no added value for predicting clinical outcome or mortality. D-dimer levels<500 μg/l may identify candidates at low risk for complications.},

To facilitate provision of PC for people living with HF, the Swiss Society of Cardiology (SSC) and the Swiss Society for Palliative Care (palliative.ch) have created joint working-group. Dyads representing cardiology and PC from Swiss HF centres have been identified. Through online voting, workshops and Delphi process priority topics for incorporation of PC into standard care for people with HF have been identified. 18 experts, from 8 Swiss HF-centres identified main topics relevant for implementation of PC in usual HF care: timely recognition of unaddressed health-related needs of affected people and their relatives (using validated assessment tools ID-PALL or NAT-PD:CH at least as the triggers evolve), identifying key palliative interventions for care of people living with HF, identifying strategies to facilitate cooperation between specialist PC and cardiology, defining research agenda to investigate efficacy of PC interventions, quality of care criteria, and outcomes of PC provision in Switzerland. Improvement of QoL of people with HF and their relatives could be greater if PC would be integrated in usual care timely. Frequent needs assessment, using validated tools helps to recognize people having unaddressed needs, and helps to replace the outdated, based on risk of dying, involvement of PC.

Their shielding effect on the radiation of sources used in ocular brachytherapy was investigated by dosimetric measurement in an eye phantom as well as numerical simulations. Different wolfram implantation techniques, such as extraocular fixation of a wolfram-silicone implant (n = 1), vitrectomy with silicone oil and intravitreal injection of a wolfram-silicone oil suspension (n = 2), and concurrent attachment of a wolfram implant onto the sclera (n = 2), were tested to investigate the long-term effects of wolfram. A vitrectomy with silicone oil without wolfram implantation was carried out in 2 rabbits (n = 2), constituting the control group. The eyes were enucleated after 3 months for histologic analysis. Wolfram-silicone mixtures have been dosimetrically proven to be very effective radiation absorbers for use in ocular brachytherapy. Severe complications, such as endophthalmitis, secondary glaucoma, cornea decompensation, and vessel occlusion, were not documented in the tested rabbit eyes after the application of wolfram. Histologic examination of the bulbi after enucleation showed epiretinal gliosis without further pathologic findings in all eyes after vitrectomy. The results of this study show that wolfram and wolfram-silicone implants constitute a promising candidate as potential radiation shielding substrates.},

An interesting feature of this response is an adaptation phase that follows its activation, when promoter levels revert to a base line level, even if salt stress is maintained. It is unclear if adaption is controlled by a switch in promoter activity or by changes in transcript levels. Here we show that the RRTF1 promoter is sufficient for the control of both activation and adaptation to salt stress. As constitutive expression of RRTF1 turned out to be detrimental to the plant, we propose that promoter-regulated adaptation evolved as a protection mechanism to balance the beneficial effects of short-term gene activation and the detrimental effects of long-term gene expression.},

  abstract = {Parallel imaging is one of the key MRI technologies that allow reduction of image acquisition time. However, the parallel imaging reconstruction commonly leads to a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) drop evaluated using a so-called geometrical factor (g-factor). The g-factor is minimized by increasing the number of array elements and their spatial diversity. At the same time, increasing the element count requires a decrease in their size. This may lead to insufficient coil loading, an increase in the relative noise contribution from the RF coil itself, and hence SNR reduction. Previously, instead of increasing the channel number, we introduced the concept of electronically switchable time-varying sensitivities, which was shown to improve parallel imaging performance. In this approach, each reconfigurable receive element supports two spatially distinct sensitivity profiles. In this work, we developed and evaluated a novel eight-element human head receive-only reconfigurable coaxial dipole array for human head imaging at 9.4 T. In contrast to the previously reported reconfigurable dipole array, the new design does not include direct current (DC) control wires connected directly to the dipoles. The coaxial cable itself is used to deliver DC voltage to the PIN diodes located at the ends of the antennas. Thus, the novel reconfigurable coaxial dipole design opens a way to scale the dynamic parallel imaging up to a realistic number of channels, that is, 32 and above. The novel array was optimized and tested experimentally, including in vivo studies. It was found that dynamic sensitivity switching provided an 8% lower mean and 33% lower maximum g-factor (for R},

First, the geometry of a single coaxial element was optimized to minimize peak SAR and sensitivity to the load variation. Next, a multi-tissue voxel model was used to numerically simulate a TxRx array coil that consisted of eight coaxial dipoles with the optimal configuration. Finally, we compared the developed array to other human head dipole arrays. Results of numerical simulations were verified on a bench and in the scanner including in vivo measurements on a healthy volunteer. The developed eight-element coaxial dipole TxRx array coil showed up to 1.1times higher SAR-efficiency than a similar in geometry folded-end and fractionated dipole array while maintaining whole brain coverage and low sensitivity of the resonance frequency to variation in the head size. As a proof of concept, we developed and constructed a prototype of a 9.4T (400 MHz) human head array consisting of eight TxRx coaxial dipoles. The developed array improved SAR-efficiency and provided for a more compact and robust alternative to the folded-end dipole design.

Attentional focus was modified via the classification task, which compared two domains of social perception (emotion and gender), using the exactly same stimulus set. Supramodal memory representations were addressed via congruency of the target categories for the classification of auditory and visual social stimuli (voices and faces). Functional magnetic resonance imaging identified attention-specific and supramodal networks. Emotion classification networks included bilateral anterior insula, pre-supplementary motor area, and right inferior frontal gyrus. They were pure attention-driven and independent from stimulus modality or congruency of the target concepts. No neural contribution of supramodal memory representations could be revealed for emotion classification. In contrast, gender classification relied on supramodal memory representations in rostral anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. In summary, different domains of social perception involve different top-down processes which take place in clearly distinguishable neural networks.},

The N-glycans on glycoproteins are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to different mannose-type N-glycans or, when the protein passes through the Golgi apparatus, to different complex glycan forms. Here we describe the capturing of N-glycopeptides from a trypsin digest of total protein extracts of Arabidopsis plants and release of these captured peptides following Peptide N-glycosidase (PNGase) treatment for analysis of N-glycan site-occupancy. The mixture of peptides released as a consequence of the PNGase treatment was analyzed by two dimensional nano-LC-MS. As the PNGase treatment of glycopeptides results in the deamidation of the asparagine (N) in the NxS/T site of the released peptide, this asparagine (N) to aspartic acid (D) conversion is used as a glycosylation 'signature'. The efficiency of PNGase F and PNGase A in peptide release is discussed. The identification of proteins with a single glycopeptide was limited by the used search algorithm but could be improved using a reference database including deamidated peptide sequences. Additional stringency settings were used for filtering results to minimize false discovery. This resulted in identification of 330 glycopeptides on 173 glycoproteins from Arabidopsis, of which 28 putative glycoproteins, that were previously not annotated as secreted protein in The Arabidopsis Information Resource database (TAIR). Furthermore, the identified glycosylation site occupancy helped to determine the correct topology for membrane proteins. A quantitative comparison of peptide signal was made between wild type and complex-glycan-less (cgl) mutant Arabidopsis from three replicate leaf samples using a label-free MS peak comparison. As an example, the identified membrane protein SKU5 (AT4G12420) showed differential glycopeptide intensity ratios between WT and cgl indicating heterogeneous glycan modification on single protein. Proteins that enter the secretory pathway are mostly modified by N-glycans. The function of N-glycosylation has been well studied in mammals. However, in plants the function of N-glycosylation is still unclear, because glycosylation mutants in plants often do not have a clear phenotype. Here we analyzed which proteins are modified by N-glycans in plants by developing a glycopeptide enrichment method for plant proteins. Subsequently, label free comparative proteomics was employed using protein fractions from wild type and from a mutant which is blocked in modification of the N-glycan into complex glycans. The results provide new information on N-glycosylation sites on numerous secreted proteins. Results allow for specific mapping of multiple glycosylation site occupancy on proteins, which provides information on which glycosylation sites are protected or non-used from downstream processing and thus presumably are buried into the protein structure. Glycoproteomics can therefore contribute to protein structure analysis. Indeed, mapping the glycosylation sites on membrane proteins gives information on the topology of protein folds over the membrane. We thus were able to correct the topology prediction of three membrane proteins. Besides, these studies also identified limitations in the software that is used to identify single modified peptide per protein.

Alternative cost-efficient and effective training methods are highly needed. The present study evaluated whether a video-feedback supported peer-guided Basic Life Support training approach achieves similar practical performance as a standard instructor-guided training in laypersons. In a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial, 288 first-year medical students were randomized to two study arms with different Basic Life Support training methods: 1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) or 2) a Peer Video Feedback (PVF). Outcome parameters were objective data for Basic Life Support performance (compression depth and rate) from a resuscitation manikin with recording software as well as overall Basic Life Support performance and subjective confidence. Non-inferiority margins (Δ) for these outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with Standard Instructor Feedback. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority. Results confirmed non-inferiority of Peer Video Feedback to Standard Instructor Feedback for compression depth (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 2.9%; 95% CI: -8.2% to 14.1%; Δ = -19%), overall Basic Life Support performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 6.7%; 95% CI: 0.0% to 14.3%; Δ = -27%) and subjective confidence for CPR performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.01; 95% CI: -0.18-0.17; Δ = -0.5) and emergency situations (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.02; 95% CI: -0.21-0.18; Δ = -0.5). Results for compression rate were inconclusive. Peer Video Feedback achieves comparable results as standard instructor-based training methods. It is an easy-to-apply and cost-efficient alternative to standard Basic Life Support training methods. To improve performance with respect to compression rate, additional implementation of a metronome is recommended.},

  abstract = {This paper develops the methodological concept of river co-learning arenas (RCAs) and explores their potential to strengthen innovative grassroots river initiatives, enliven river commons, regenerate river ecologies, and foster greater socio-ecological justice. The integrity of river systems has been threatened in profound ways over the last century. Pollution, damming, canalisation, and water grabbing are some examples of pressures threatening the entwined lifeworlds of human and non-human communities that depend on riverine systems. Finding ways to reverse the trends of environmental degradation demands complex spatial-temporal, political, and institutional articulations across different levels of governance (from local to global) and among a plurality of actors who operate from diverse spheres of knowledge and systems of practice, and who have distinct capacities to affect decision-making. In this context, grassroots river initiatives worldwide use new multi-actor and multi-level dialogue arenas to develop proposals for river regeneration and promote social-ecological justice in opposition to dominant technocratic-hydraulic development strategies. This paper conceptualises these spaces of dialogue and action as RCAs and critically reflects on ways of organising and supporting RCAs while facilitating their cross-fertilisation in transdisciplinary practice. By integrating studies, debates, and theories from diverse disciplines, we generate multi-faceted insights and present cornerstones for the engagement with and/or enaction of RCAs. This encompasses five main themes central to RCAs: (1) River knowledge encounters and truth regimes, (2) transgressive co-learning, (3) confrontation and collaboration dynamics, (4) ongoing reflexivity, (5) transcultural knowledge assemblages and translocal bridging of rooted knowledge.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional domain swapping is a common phenomenon in pancreatic-like ribonucleases. In the aggregated state, these proteins acquire new biological functions, including selective cytotoxicity against tumour cells. RNase A is able to dislocate both N- and C-termini, but usually this process requires denaturing conditions. In contrast, bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase), which is a homo-dimeric protein sharing 80% of sequence identity with RNase A, occurs natively as a mixture of swapped and unswapped isoforms. The presence of two disulfides bridging the subunits, indeed, ensures a dimeric structure also to the unswapped molecule. In vitro, the two BS-RNase isoforms interconvert under physiological conditions. Since the tendency to swap is often related to the instability of the monomeric proteins, in these paper we have analysed in detail the stability in solution of the monomeric derivative of BS-RNase (mBS) by a combination of NMR studies and Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The refinement of NMR structure and relaxation data indicate a close similarity with RNase A, without any evidence of aggregation or partial opening. The high compactness of mBS structure is confirmed also by H/D exchange, urea denaturation, and TEMPOL mapping of the protein surface. The present extensive structural and dynamic investigation of (monomeric) mBS did not show any experimental evidence that could explain the known differences in swapping between BS-RNase and RNase A. Hence, we conclude that the swapping in BS-RNase must be influenced by the distinct features of the dimers, suggesting a prominent role for the interchain disulfide bridges.},

We report an analysis of 3D-DS in bovine seminal ribonuclease, a homodimeric protein whose subunits are linked by two disulfide bridges, based on NMR and biochemical studies. The presence of the covalent bonds between the subunits stabilizes the unswapped dimer, and allows distinct evaluation of the structural and dynamic effects of the swapping with respect to the dimerization process. In comparison with the monomeric subunit, which, in solution has a compact structure without any propensity for local unfolding, both swapped and unswapped dimers show increased flexibility. NMR analysis, together with urea denaturation and hydrogen–deuterium exchange data, indicates that the two dimers have increased conformational fluctuations. Furthermore, we found that the rate-limiting step of both the swapping and unswapping pathways is the detachment of the N-terminal helices from the monomers. These results suggest a new general mechanism in which a dimeric intermediate could facilitate 3D-DS in globular proteins.},

Such peptides have been found both in the gliadin and glutenin proteins in gluten. The only cure for CD is a lifelong gluten-free diet. It is unknown, however, if all wheat varieties are equally harmful for patients. We investigated whether wheat varieties exist with a natural low number of T-cell-stimulatory epitopes. Gluten proteins present in public databases were analyzed for the presence of T-cell-stimulatory sequences. In addition, wheat accessions from diploid (AA, SS/BB, and DD genomes), tetraploid (AABB), and hexaploid (AABBDD) Triticum species were tested for the presence of T-cell-stimulatory epitopes in gliadins and glutenins by both T-cell and monoclonal antibody-based assays. The database analysis readily identified gluten proteins that lack 1 or more of the known T-cell-stimulatory sequences. Moreover, both the T-cell- and antibody-based assays showed that a large variation exists in the amount of T-cell-stimulatory peptides present in the wheat accessions. Sufficient genetic variation is present to endeavor the selection of wheat accessions that contain low amounts of T-cell-stimulatory sequences. Such materials may be used to select and breed wheat varieties suitable for consumption by CD patients, contributing to a well-balanced diet and an increase in their quality of life. Such varieties also may be useful for disease prevention in individuals at risk.},

Conventionally, ICG clearance (ClICG) is measured by a series of blood samples with subsequent laboratory analysis. More recently bedside techniques have become available to measure ICG concentrations in vivo and in addition to ClICG, the plasma disappearance rate of ICG (PDRICG) is increasingly being used. The aim of this study was to assess and to compare the normal time courses of ClICG and PDRICG in liver transplant recipients. ClICG and PDRICG were measured perioperatively and at various times up to 24 h after liver transplantation. The bedside transpulmonary indicator dilution technique with an arterial fiberoptic-thermistor catheter was used to assess the ICG concentration time curve together with total circulating blood volume (Vd circ). Similar patterns of the time courses of ClICG and PDRICG with a fast recovery of ICG elimination in the early reperfusion period were observed. Compared to healthy subjects, ClICG was supranormal and PDRICG was slightly subnormal. In this study, Vd circ was increased at baseline and remained increased during surgery. PDRICG and ClICG are well suited to monitor onset and maintenance of graft function in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The PDRICG values measured tend to be relatively lower than ClICG because of an increased blood volume in these patients. By knowing these differences it is justified to monitor liver function in a very simple manner with PDRICG.},

  abstract = {Cardiac output measurements are often helpful in the management of critically ill patients and high risk-patients. In this study an alternative technique for measurement of cardiac output by the transpulmonary indicator dilution technique (TPID) was evaluated in comparison to conventional thermodilution using a pulmonary artery catheter. With TPID, a thermistor-tipped catheter (the smallest available is 1.3 F) is placed in the aorta via a femoral artery introducer. Thus, TPID can also be used in very small children in whom placement of a pulmonary artery catheter may be difficult or even impossible. In principle, TPID is less invasive since the possible complications of the pulmonary catheters are avoided. We investigated the accuracy and reproducibility of transpulmonary thermodilution in patients over a broad range in age and body surface. Following approval by the ethics committee and written consent, the data were obtained from 21 patients without a circulatory shunt undergoing diagnostic heart catheterization. The patients were between 0.5 and 25.2 years old, their body surface between 0.35 and 1.89 m2. Measurements were performed in duplicate with bolus injections of ice-cold normal saline (0.15 ml/kg), randomly spread over the respiratory cycle. In total 48 thermodilution curves were measured simultaneously in the pulmonary artery and in the aorta. Thermodilution curves were monoexponentially extrapolated for elimination of recirculation and cardiac output was calculated with a standard Stewart Hamilton procedure. The amplitude of the typical arterial thermodilution curve shows a smaller and more delayed course than the pulmonary artery thermodilution curve. There was a very good correlation between the values found by pulmonary and TPID cardiac output measurements (R = 0.968). There was a slightly smaller cardiac output value measured by the TPID (Bias = -4.7 +/- 1.5% sem) The reproducibility of duplicate measurements with the two methods were nearly the same, the standard deviation of the difference was 10.9% for the pulmonary thermodilution method and 11.7% for TPID. DISCUSSION. TPID gives an alternative technique for measurement of cardiac output. We showed over a broad range in age and body surface a very good correlation with thermodilution measurements in the pulmonary artery. The slightly smaller values for TPID are explained by early recirculation, for clinical purposes the difference is negligible. However, the reproducibility of a method is clinically very important. Both methods showed in duplicate measurements basically the same reproducibility. The disadvantage of TPID in being more sensitive to baseline alteration is counterbalanced by less respiratory variability in comparison to the conventional thermodilution technique. However, by increasing the amount of injected indicator (i.e., 0.2 ml/kg approximately equal to 15 ml in an adult) it is possible to reduce the effect of baseline alteration. By using fiberoptic catheters it is even possible to use TPID as double-indicator dilution technique to measure intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV) and extravascular lung water (EVLW). We conclude that in many patients TPID might be an attractive, less invasive and reliable alternative to conventional cardiac output measurement by pulmonary artery catheter.},

The best clinical measure of preload is the end-diastolic volume of the heart, which can be assessed by ventriculography, echocardiography or by indicator dilution techniques. Afterload is basically the wall tension during the ejection phase. For clinical purposes afterload can be reasonably monitored by arterial blood pressure. The most difficult parameter to assess under clinical conditions is contractility, since exact measurement of contractility requires instantaneous measurements of left-ventricular pressure-volume loops and an artificial afterload or preload challenge. However, most recent theoretical analysis of ventricular-arterial coupling by various models revealed that the ejection fraction seems to be an appropriate parameter to evaluate, whether the prevailing contractility matches preload and afterload conditions. An ejection fraction of approximately 60% under almost any clinical circumstances is associated with an optimal performance of the heart in terms of myocardial oxygen utilisation.},

In this work we have measured dχ(fat)/dT of human breast fat tissue, using a double-reference method to ensure invariance to temperature-induced changes in the proton electron screening constant. Ex vivo measurements were taken on a 14.1 T five mm narrow bore NMR spectrometer. Breast fat tissue samples were collected from six subjects, directly postmortem. The susceptibility was measured over a temperature range from 24°C to 65°C. A linear behavior of the susceptibility over temperature was observed for all samples. The resulting dχ(fat)/dT of human breast fat ranged between 0.0039 and 0.0076 ppm/°C.

Computer reconstructions of the external shape of the jaw muscles of 30 adult males with a normal skull were made with the use of serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The orientation of the jaw muscles was defined by a regression line through the centroids of the serial cross-sections. Sagittal and frontal projections of the moment arms of the muscles were measured with respect to the centre of the ipsilateral condyle. Craniofacial morphology was analysed three-dimensionally using lateral head films and coronal MRI scans. The cephalometric data were analysed statistically using regression and factor analyses. Six cephalometric factors with Eigen values higher than 1 were correlated with jaw muscle orientation and moment arm data, using a multiple regression analysis. The anterior face height factor was significantly correlated with the orientation of the jaw opening muscles in the sagittal plane but was not significantly correlated with the orientation of the mandibular elevators. The sagittal moment arms of the mandibular elevators showed significant correlations with the factors describing the gonial angle and the posterior face height. It was concluded that the variation of spatial orientation of the human jaw closing muscles is predominantly associated with the variation of mandibular morphology (expressed by the gonial angle) and the posterior face height.

  abstract = {Tet proteins oxidize 5-methylcytosine (mC) to generate 5-hydroxymethyl (hmC), 5-formyl (fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (caC). The exact function of these oxidative cytosine bases remains elusive. We applied quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomics to identify readers for mC and hmC in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), neuronal progenitor cells (NPC), and adult mouse brain tissue. Readers for these modifications are only partially overlapping, and some readers, such as Rfx proteins, display strong specificity. Interactions are dynamic during differentiation, as for example evidenced by the mESC-specific binding of Klf4 to mC and the NPC-specific binding of Uhrf2 to hmC, suggesting specific biological roles for mC and hmC. Oxidized derivatives of mC recruit distinct transcription regulators as well as a large number of DNA repair proteins in mouse ES cells, implicating the DNA damage response as a major player in active DNA demethylation.},

  abstract = {Offshore produced water (PW) is one of the largest and most chemically complex effluents of waste directly and intentionally discharged into the marine environment. Although it is well known that PW can be severely toxic to marine organisms, the mechanisms of toxicity remain poorly understood, contributed by the lack of comprehensive chemical characterization of the PW. In this study, we applied elements of effects-directed analysis with the aim to identify organic chemical drivers of toxicity in PW towards fish early life stages. A solvent extract of a PW was fractioned based on compound functionality and chemically characterized by a concert of techniques including high-resolution gas and liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The effect of PW and fractions on survival, development, and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos was tested. It is evident that embryotoxicity of PW organics cannot be attributed to one compound class. In this study, the fractions primarily containing production chemicals were of low toxicity, whereas both fractions containing petroleum hydrocarbons, and fractions containing oxidation products of these, contributed to toxicity.},

The lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) is a keystone prey species in the North Sea and coastal systems. Their eggs adhere to the seabed substrate making them particularly vulnerable to oil exposure during embryonic development. We evaluated the sensitivity of sandeel embryos to crude oil in a laboratory by exposing them to dispersed oil at concentrations of 0, 15, 50, and 150 µg/L oil between 2 and 16 days post-fertilization. We assessed water and tissue concentrations of THC and tPAH, cyp1a expression, lipid distribution in the eyes, head and trunk, and morphological and functional deformities. Oil droplets accumulated on the eggshell in all oil treatment groups, to which the embryo responded by a dose-dependent rise in cyp1a expression. The oil exposure led to only minor sublethal deformities in the upper jaw and otic vesicle. The findings suggest that lesser sandeel embryos are resilient to crude oil exposure. The lowest observed effect level documented in this study was 36 µg THC/L and 3 µg tPAH/L. The inclusion of these species-specific data in risk assessment models will enhance the precision of risk evaluations for the North Atlantic ecosystems.},

This study examines the downstream transcriptomic responses of Atlantic halibut larvae exposed to crude oil during organogenesis. Findings show concentration-dependent transcriptional abnormalities. Pathway analysis at 10 days post-hatch (dph), 11 days after cessation of oil exposure, indicates downregulation of inflammatory and reparative pathways. By 18 dph, tissue-specific analyses reveal activation of these pathways, especially in head tissues, alongside upregulation of neuronal signaling pathways. This highlights the complex relationship between oil exposure and transcriptional responses, emphasizing recovery mechanisms represented by regulation of inflammatory, repair and wound healing pathways following oil exposure. The activation of repair pathways in surviving larvae suggests compensatory processes to address oil-induced damage. These novel insights enhance understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oil toxicity and the lasting effects on marine organisms.},

A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was used with a crossover design. Group 1 received six sessions EMDR first and then six sessions COMET; group 2 vice versa. Assessments were made at baseline (T0), end of first treatment (T1), and end of second treatment (T2). Main outcome was self-esteem. We included 47 patients and performed Linear Mixed Models. COMET showed more improvements in self-esteem than EMDR: effect-sizes 1.25 versus 0.46 post-treatment. Unexpectedly, when EMDR was given first, subsequent effects of COMET were significantly reduced in comparison to COMET as the first intervention. For EMDR, sequence made no difference. Reductions in anxiety and depression were mediated by better self-esteem. COMET was associated with significantly greater improvements in self-esteem than EMDR in patients with anxiety disorders. EMDR treatment reduced the effectiveness of subsequent COMET. Improved self-esteem mediated reductions in anxiety and depression symptoms.},

The relationships between the environmental factors and CDIs were analysed in a hybrid within- and between-hospital random-effect model.

All inpatients in 129 general hospital trusts of the NHS in the years 2011-2019, covering 120,629 cases of CDI. Annual number of CDIs per hospital trust. Single rooms were associated with fewer CDIs at the within-hospital level, but not at the between-hospital level. Similarly, more nursing staff was associated with fewer CDIs at the within-hospital level, but not at the between-hospital level. This effect was not observed for physician staffing. A different picture emerged for the protective effect of cultural resources, with a weakly significant effect of between-hospital differences, but no within-hospital effect. Financial resources were not associated with CDIs either between hospitals or within them over time. The present study identified hospital resources with a beneficial influence on CDI rates. Healthcare organizations can use this knowledge for active CDI prevention.},

Even magnesium (Mg) has been shown to constitute a favorable biomaterial for the development of stabilizing structures. However, it has been described that it is necessary to prevent premature degradation to ensure both the functionality and the biocompatibility of such Mg implants. Different coating strategies have already been developed, but most of them did not provide the desired functionality. The present study analyses a new approach based on ion implantation (II) with PVD coating for the passivation of a newly developed Mg membrane for GBR/GTR procedures. To demonstrate comprehensive biocompatibility and successful passivation of the Mg membranes, untreated Mg (MG) and coated Mg (MG-Co) were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Thereby a collagen membrane with an already shown biocompatibility was used as control material. All investigations were performed according to EN ISO 10993 regulations. The in vitro results showed that both the untreated and PVD-coated membranes were not cytocompatible. However, both membrane types fulfilled the requirements for in vivo biocompatibility. Interestingly, the PVD coating did not have an influence on the gas cavity formation compared to the uncoated membrane, but it induced lower numbers of anti-inflammatory macrophages in comparison to the pure Mg membrane and the collagen membrane. In contrast, the pure Mg membrane provoked an immune response that was fully comparable to the collagen membrane. Altogether, this study shows that pure magnesium membranes represent a promising alternative compared to the nonresorbable volume-stable materials for GBR/GTR therapy.},

Therefore, the objective of our investigation was to assess whether the Sarculator reveals a difference in prognosis and whether such differentiation aligns with actual clinical data. Thirty-one patients with primary or secondary soft tissue angiosarcoma, treated at our Sarcoma Center from 2001 to 2023, were included in the study. Actual survival rates were compared with nomogram-derived data for predicted 5-year survival (Sarculator), as well as 4-, 8- and 12-year sarcoma-specific death probabilities (MSKCC). Harrell's c-index was utilized to assess predictive validity. In total, 31 patients were analyzed. The actual overall 5-year survival was 22.57% with a predicted 5-year survival rate of 25.97%, and the concordance index was 0.726 for the entire cohort. The concordance index results from MSKCC for angiosarcoma patients were below 0.7 indicating limited predictive accuracy in this cohort, particularly when compared to Sarculator. Nomogram-based predictive models are valuable tools in clinical practice for rapidly assessing prognosis. They can streamline the decision-making process for adjuvant treatments and improve patient counselling especially in the treatment of rare and complicated tumor entities such as angiosarcomas.},

Patients enrolled in the International Takotsubo (InterTAK) Registry from January 2011 to February 2020 with available data on peak cTn levels were included in the analysis. Peak cTn levels during the index hospitalization were used to define clinically relevant myocardial injury. The threshold at which clinically relevant myocardial injury drives mortality at 1 year was identified using restricted cubic spline analysis. Out of 2'938 patients, 222 (7.6%) patients died during 1-year follow-up. A more than 28.8-fold increase of cTn above the upper reference limit was identified as threshold for clinically relevant myocardial injury. The presence of clinically relevant myocardial injury was significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality at 5 years (adjusted HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.18-2.12, p =.002). Clinically relevant myocardial injury was related to an increased 5-year mortality risk in patients with apical TTS (adjusted HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.21-2.03, p =.001), in presence of physical stressors (adjusted HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.22-2.11, p =.001), and in absence of emotional stressors (adjusted HR 1.49, 95% CI, 1.17-1.89, p =.001). This study for the first time determined a troponin threshold for the identification of TTS patients at excess risk of mortality.

To date, no large-scale study has investigated whether this is applicable to shoulder arthroplasty. We used the New Zealand Joint Registry to assess whether the use of surgical helmet systems was associated with lower all-cause revision or revision for deep infection in primary shoulder arthroplasties. We analyzed 16,000 shoulder arthroplasties (hemiarthroplasties, anatomical, and reverse geometry prostheses) recorded on the New Zealand Joint Registry from its inception in 2000 to the present day. We assessed patient factors including age, BMI, sex, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, as well as whether or not the operation took place in a laminar flow operating theatre. A total of 2,728 operations (17%) took place using surgical helmet systems. Patient cohorts were broadly similar in terms of indication for surgery (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fractures) and medical comorbidities (age and sex). There were 842 revisions (5% of cases) with just 98 for deep infection (0.6% of all cases or 11.6% of the revisions). There were no differences in all-cause revisions or revision for deep infection between the surgical helmet systems and conventional gowns (p = 0.893 and p = 0.911, respectively). We found no evidence that wearing a surgical helmet system reduces the incidence of periprosthetic joint infection in any kind of primary shoulder arthroplasty. We acknowledge the limitations of this registry study and accept that there may be other benefits in terms of personal protection, comfort, or visibility. However, given their financial and ecological footprint, they should be used judiciously in shoulder surgery.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether surgical helmet systems (SHSs) reduce rates of PJI after elbow arthroplasty in a population-based registry study over a consecutive 23-year period. We hypothesized that SHS would reduce the incidence of PJI compared with conventional surgical gowns following elbow arthroplasty surgery. This is a retrospective review of prospectively collected data using information obtained from the New Zealand National Joint Registry. Patients were categorized using SHSs or conventional gowns. The primary outcome was revision for PJI. The secondary outcome was all-cause revision. These were compared between the groups. A total of 720 elbow arthroplasties were recorded over a consecutive 23-year period (2000-2023), including 670 total elbow arthroplasties and 50 hemiarthroplasties. Among these, 634 (88%) procedures were performed with conventional gowns. There were 59 revisions in total (7.2% of total operations), and 17 of these were for PJI (2.1% of total operations). The revision rate for all causes was 21.1% in the SHS group and 5.5% in conventional gown group. The revision rate for PJI was 5.6% and 1.9% in the SHS group and conventional gown group, respectively. The revision risk was significantly higher in the SHSs group compared with the conventional gown group for both all-cause revision (hazard ratio [HR] 3.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.04-6.09; P < .001) and revisions for PJI (HR 3.26, 95% CI 1.15-9.26; P = .019). The use of SHSs compared with conventional surgical gowns was not protective against PJI in elbow arthroplasties in this study.

The chromatography, using the same volatile ion-pair reagent heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA), takes only 10 min. Relative standard deviation of retention times was never above 2.26% (n=36). The method was fully validated based on the US FDA Bioanalytical Method Validation Guidance for Industry. As such, a quantitative ESI-LC-MS(/MS) (TOF mass spectrometry) method was optimized for the absolute quantification of glycopyrrolate in human plasma in a concentration range from 0.101 to 101 ng/mL using a quadratic calibration function (R(2)=0.9995), y=-2.21 x 10(-4) (+/-3.93 x 10(-5))xx(2)+5.85 x 10(-2) (+/-5.27 x 10(-3))xx+4.08 x 10(-3) (+/-4.82 x 10(-4)). For the three QC concentrations (QC(1) 0.252, QC(2) 2.52, and QC(3) 25.2ng/mL) and the LLOQ (0.101 ng/mL), total precision was under 20% (18.0% (n=6) at the LLOQ) and maximum accuracy was 112% (88.9% for the LLOQ, n=6). Absolute matrix effect (maximum 133%+/-9.59, n=3), absolute recovery (better than 41.8%+/-2.22, n=3), relative (inter-subject) matrix effect (maximum 10.9%+/-1.45, n=4) and process efficiency (better than 45.2%+/-5.74, n=3) too were assessed at the 3 QC concentrations.},

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in the modeling of protein-protein complexes by docking, additional information is often required to identify the best solutions. For this purpose, NMR data deliver valuable restraints that can be used in the sampling and/or the scoring stage, like in the data-driven docking approach HADDOCK that can make use of NMR chemical shift perturbation (CSP) data to define the binding site on each protein and drive the docking. We show here that a quantitative use of chemical shifts (CS) in the scoring stage can help to resolve ambiguities. A quantitative CS-RMSD score based on (1) H(α) ,(13) C(α) , and (15) N chemical shifts ranks the best solutions always at the top, as demonstrated on a small benchmark of four complexes. It is implemented in a new docking protocol, CS-HADDOCK, which combines CSP data as ambiguous interaction restraints in the sampling stage with the CS-RMSD score in the final scoring stage. This combination of qualitative and quantitative use of chemical shifts increases the reliability of data-driven docking for the structure determination of complexes from limited NMR data.},

Expansion of the initial spermatogonial stem cell pool through cell culturing is a necessary step to obtain enough cells for effective repopulation of the testis after transplantation. Since in vitro propagation can lead to (epi-)genetic mutations and possibly malignant transformation of the starting cell population, we set out to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation status in uncultured and cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ sorted cells and compare them with germ cell tumor samples of the seminoma subtype. Seminomas displayed a severely global hypomethylated profile, including loss of genomic imprinting, which we did not detect in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells. Differential methylation analysis revealed altered regulation of gamete formation and meiotic processes in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells but not in seminomas. The pivotal POU5F1 marker was hypomethylated in seminomas but not in uncultured or cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells, which is reflected in the POU5F1 mRNA expression levels. Lastly, seminomas displayed a number of characteristic copy number variations that were not detectable in primary testicular ITGA6+ cells, either before or after culture. Together, the data show a distinct DNA methylation patterns in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells that does not resemble the pattern found in seminomas, but also highlight the need for more sensitive methods to fully exclude the presence of malignant cells after culture and to further study the epigenetic events that take place during in vitro culture.},

Secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of ABP-700 and its primary metabolite (cyclopropyl-methoxycarbonyl acid), to assess the clinical effects of ABP-700, and to investigate the dose-response and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships. Sixty subjects were divided into 10 cohorts and received an increasing, single bolus of either ABP-700 or placebo. Safety was assessed by clinical laboratory evaluations, infusion-site reactions, continuous monitoring of vital signs, physical examination, adverse event monitoring, and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing. Clinical effects were assessed with modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation and Bispectral Index monitoring. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Stopping criteria were met at 1.00 mg/kg dose. No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events were dose-dependent and comprised involuntary muscle movement, tachycardia, and ventilatory effects. Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation evoked a physiologic cortisol response in all subjects, no different from placebo. Pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional. A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model described the data well. A rapid onset of anesthesia/sedation after bolus administration and also a rapid recovery were observed. A quantitative concentration-effect relationship was described for the modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation and Bispectral Index. This first-in-human study of ABP-700 shows that ABP-700 was safe and well tolerated after single-bolus injections up to 1.00 mg/kg.

Supported by molecular modeling calculations, the AFM and NMR experiments provide a detailed knowledge about the composition of collagen hydrolysates and collagen ointments.

Finally, the direction of future research necessary to bridge these tools towards clinical integration is discussed. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a pivotal treatment option for select patients with severe aortic stenosis, and its indication for use continues to broaden. Noninvasive imaging techniques such as CTA and MRA have become routine for patient selection, preprocedural planning, and predicting the risk of complications. As the current methods for pre-TAVR image analysis are labor-intensive and have significant inter-operator variability, experts are looking towards artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution. AI has the potential to significantly enhance the planning, execution, and post-procedural follow up of TAVR. While AI tools are promising, the irreplaceable value of nuanced clinical judgment by skilled physician teams must not be overlooked. With continued research, collaboration, and careful implementation, AI can become an integral part in imaging for TAVR, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.},

Group C and group PX served as control groups and included sham-pinealectomized and pinealectomized animals that were treated with 10% ethanol solution (0,1ml/daily, subcutaneous). Animals from third group (group PXM) underwent pinealectomy and seven days after surgery started receiving melatonin dissolved in 10% ethanol solution (3mg/kg/daily, subcutaneous). All animals were treated for 4 weeks. Volume density of the thymus cortex showed statistically significant (p<0,05) decrease while the volume density of the thymus medulla was increased in the pinealectomized compared to the sham-pinealectomized female rats. Numerical density of macrophages as well as the distribution of blood vessels showed no gender differences. The numerical density of lymphocytes was statistically significantly decreased in female in comparison to the male pinealectomized rats. Melatonin treatment was proved to cause reverse effects in the sense that the results from the melatonin treated group corresponded to the results obtained from the control group of animals. The results of this study suggest that the pinealectomy causes gender-related changes in the rat thymus. Short-term melatonin treatment showed reverse effect, equally in both sexes.},

  abstract = {One of the greatest examples of integrated signal transduction is revealed by examination of effects mediated by AKT kinase in myocardial biology. Positioned at the intersection of multiple afferent and efferent signals, AKT exemplifies a molecular sensing node that coordinates dynamic responses of the cell in literally every aspect of biological responses. The balanced and nuanced nature of homeostatic signaling is particularly essential within the myocardial context, where regulation of survival, energy production, contractility, and response to pathological stress all flow through the nexus of AKT activation or repression. Equally important, the loss of regulated AKT activity is primarily the cause or consequence of pathological conditions leading to remodeling of the heart and eventual decompensation. This review presents an overview compendium of the complex world of myocardial AKT biology gleaned from more than a decade of research. Summarization of the widespread influence that AKT exerts upon myocardial responses leaves no doubt that the participation of AKT in molecular signaling will need to be reckoned with as a seemingly omnipresent regulator of myocardial molecular biological responses.},

We present the case of a preterm neonate with a right atrial mass of uncertain etiology. Multimodal imaging, including echocardiography and cardiac MRI, suggested the presence of a thrombus-consistent with thrombi being the most common type of intracavitary cardiac mass. As a result, primary anticoagulation therapy was initiated. However, after 16 days without significant change in the mass and given the high risk of embolization and the possibility of a benign tumor, surgical excision was performed. Histopathological analysis of the excised tissue could not definitively distinguish between an organized thrombus and a regressed benign neoplasm, although no malignant cells were identified. This case highlights the diagnostic uncertainty surrounding neonatal intracardiac masses and the limitations of imaging and pathology in achieving definitive diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach and long-term follow-up are essential, particularly when the true nature of the mass remains unclear.},

DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most commonly studied epigenetic feature. In this study we conducted an epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis on height-related traits in a Sub-Saharan African population, in order to detect DNAm biomarkers across four height-related traits. DNAm profiles were acquired in whole blood samples of 704 Ghanaians, sourced from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants study, using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear models were fitted to detect differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) associated with height, leg-to-height ratio (LHR), leg length, and sitting height. No epigenome-wide significant DMPs were recorded. However we did observe among our top DMPs five informative probes associated with the height-related traits: cg26905768 (leg length), cg13268132 (leg length), cg19776793 (height), cg23072383 (LHR), and cg24625894 (sitting height).

The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of SS-RFs and assess CVD risk, knowledge, perceptions and behaviours in premenopausal Canadian women. An online survey was distributed across Canada to premenopausal biological females (19-49 years of age). The survey gathered demographics, medical history, engagement in health-promoting behaviours, and knowledge and perceptions of CVD risk. CVD risk was calculated using medical risk and SS-RFs were tabulated from medical history. A total of 2559 participants (33 ± 8 years) completed the survey. The majority of our sample (82%) was classified as low medical risk. Of those classified as low risk, 35% had at least 1 SS-RF. Of high-risk individuals, 70% underestimated their risk, 21% of whom perceived themselves as low risk. Engagement in health behaviours was suboptimal. Knowledge of traditional CVD risk factors and prevention was relatively high; however, less than one-half were aware of SS-RFs such as early menopause (39.4%). Considering both traditional and SS-RFs, 47% of premenopausal Canadian women may be at risk for developing CVD. Of those deemed low medical risk for developing CVD, more than one-third reported having at least 1 SS-RF. Canadian women have poor knowledge of the risks associated with SS-RFs, lack sufficient awareness of the need for prevention of CVD, and are not engaging in sufficient health-promoting behaviours to mitigate future CVD risk.},

From Citrus limon, four monoterpene synthase-encoding cDNAs for a beta-pinene synthase named Cl(-)betaPINS, a gamma-terpinene synthase named ClgammaTS, and two limonene synthases named Cl(+)LIMS1 and Cl(+)LIMS2 were recently isolated [J. Lücker et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 269 (2002) 3160]. The aim of our work in this study was to identify domains within these monoterpene synthase enzymes determining the product specificity. Domain swapping experiments between Cl(-)betaPINS and ClgammaTS and between Cl(+)LIMS2 and ClgammaTS were conducted. We found that within the C-terminal domain of these monoterpene synthases, a region comprising 200 amino acids, of which 41 are different between Cl(-)betaPINS and ClgammaTS, determines the specificity for the formation of beta-pinene or gamma-terpinene, respectively, while another region localized further downstream is required for a chimeric enzyme to yield products in the same ratio as in the wild-type ClgammaTS. For Cl(+)LIMS2, the two domains together appear to be sufficient for its enzyme specificity, but many chimeras were inactive probably due to the low homology with ClgammaTS. Molecular modeling was used to further pinpoint the amino acids responsible for the differences in product specificity of ClgammaTS and Cl(-)betaPINS.},

However, in some instances, a subsequent inflammatory reaction can occur that causes the adhesion of orbital tissue to the titanium mesh. The adhesion of the orbital soft tissue to the mesh causes diplopia, lid rigidity and extraocular movements restriction. This study was performed to determine if the placement of a collagen membrane over a titanium mesh can prevent the adhesion of orbital soft tissue for an improved clinical outcome. Clinical considerations: A case study was performed investigating 106 patients undergoing a periorbital restoration. Seventy-two patients received a titanium mesh without a barrier membrane, 12 patients received a barrier membrane composed of autologous auricular cartilage to provide a barrier function and 22 patients received a pericardium collagen membrane and titanium mesh. Titanium has been shown to generate an intense inflammatory reaction in host tissues, which can cause fibrosis to adjacent structures. Fibrosis is an essential factor in the repair of fracture sites, however this can lead to adverse effects in the orbital socket. Fibrosis can cause cicatrization and lower eyelid retraction when induced along the lower orbital rim. An improved outcome can be achieved by using a barrier between the titanium mesh and the soft tissue, such as autogenous auricular cartilage, however, only patients treated with a resorbable collagen membrane to act as a soft tissue barricade during site regeneration, prevented the fibrosis reaction and related problems from occurring.},

Shorter time to administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with improved outcomes, but early recognition of sepsis remains a major challenge. In a two-center cohort study with prospective sample collection from 1400 adult patients in emergency departments suspected of sepsis, we sought to determine the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of a machine-learning algorithm based on clinical data and a set of uncommonly measured biomarkers. Specifically, we demonstrate that a machine-learning model developed using this dataset outputs a score with not only diagnostic capability but also prognostic power with respect to hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day mortality, and 3-day inpatient re-admission both in our entire testing cohort and various subpopulations. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for diagnosis of sepsis was 0.83. Predicted risk scores for patients with septic shock were higher compared with patients with sepsis but without shock (p < 0.0001). Scores for patients with infection and organ dysfunction were higher compared with those without either condition (p < 0.0001). Stratification based on predicted scores of the patients into low, medium, and high-risk groups showed significant differences in LOS (p < 0.0001), 30-day mortality (p < 0.0001), and 30-day inpatient readmission (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, a machine-learning algorithm based on electronic medical record (EMR) data and three nonroutinely measured biomarkers demonstrated good diagnostic and prognostic capability at the time of initial blood culture.},

Reduced expression of this gene and of its encoded protein, dysbindin-1, have been reported in the brains of schizophrenia cases. It has not been established, however, if the protein reductions encompass all dysbindin-1 isoforms or if they are associated with decreased DTNBP1 gene expression. Using a matched pairs design in which each of 28 Caucasian schizophrenia cases was matched in age and sex to a normal Caucasian control, Western blotting of whole-tissue lysates of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) revealed significant reductions in dysbindin-1C (but not in dysbindin-1A or -1B) in schizophrenia (P = 0.022). These reductions occurred without any significant change in levels of the encoding transcript in the same tissue samples and in the absence of the only DTNBP1 risk haplotype for schizophrenia reported in the USA. Indeed, no significant correlations were found between case-control differences in any dysbindin-1 isoform and the case-control differences in its encoding mRNA. Consequently, the mean 60% decrease in dysbindin-1C observed in 71% of our case-control pairs appears to reflect abnormalities in mRNA translation and/or processes promoting dysbindin-1C degradation (e.g. oxidative stress, phosphorylation and/or ubiquitination). Given the predominantly post-synaptic localization of dysbindin-1C and known post-synaptic effects of dysbindin-1 reductions in the rodent equivalent of the DLPFC, the present findings suggest that decreased dysbindin-1C in the DLPFC may contribute to the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia by promoting NMDA receptor hypofunction in fast-spiking interneurons.},

Also the radiological response was related to the clinical response. Six weeks after WBRT follow-up MR was performed in 27 of 49 patients. Of the remaining 22 patients without follow-up MR, 9 had died or deteriorated due to neurologic decline. In four patients (15%) tumor increase was demonstrated by computer-assisted analysis; in the other 23 patients tumor remained stable (15%) or decreased (70%). In 11 of the 27 patients, a second follow-up MR was obtained 26 wk after WBRT demonstrating tumor increase in seven patients (64%). Complete discordance between both assessment methods was noticed in only 4 of 38 MR scans (27 scans 6 wk after WBRT and 11 scans 26 wk after WBRT) with small quantitative changes in tumor volume. In 26 of 38 (68%) observations 6 and 26 wk after WBRT, there was a positive correlation between change in tumor volume and change in the Neurologic Status. Visual estimation analysis seems an appropriate method of routine therapy monitoring in individual patients with brain metastases. The computer-assisted analysis should be considered if precise response monitoring becomes critical.},

We determined the effects of age on generalized fractional anisotropy in selected fiber tracts as well as in a whole brain voxel-based analysis. For comparison, we studied the effects of age on regional gray and white matter volumes. We found a significant reduction in anterior corpus callosum fiber tract integrity with age (P < 0.001), as well as significant GFA reduction throughout the subcortical white matter (P < 0.05, false discovery rate [FDR] corrected). GFA decline was accompanied by significant gray matter atrophy in frontal and temporal association cortex (P < 0.05, FDR corrected).

Blood samples collected at the start of the study and after twelve weeks were analyzed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In addition to the microbiological quality of the dialysate, the appearance of a "clinical event" was assessed. At baseline, mean IL-6 levels were within the reference range whereas mean CRP levels were slightly elevated. Mean values did not change after 12 weeks of HD with either modality. After subdividing the patients in quartiles with increasing change in plasma CRP, 23.0% of the patients showed a change of more than 8.0 mg/L. In a multiple regression analysis, CRP levels appeared to be independent of the degree of dialysate contamination, the material and the flux characteristics of the devices. In fact, the variable "clinical events" was the only significant predictor of the plasma CRP levels (P < 0.001). Based on these results, both PS and CTA super-flux dialyzers appear safe for clinical use.

The median duration between LVAD-implantation and first specialist palliative care contact was 17 months (IQR 6.3-50.3 months). Median duration between consultation and death was seven days (IQR 3-28 days). 65% of consults took place in an intensive/intermediate care unit with half of the patients having a Do-Not-Resuscitate order. Care planning significantly increased during involvement (advance directives before: n = 15, after: n = 19, p < 0.001; DNR before: n = 20, after: n = 28, p < 0.001). Symptom burden as assessed at first specialist palliative care contact was higher compared to the consultation requests (request: median 3 symptoms (IQR 3-6); first contact: median 9 (IQR 6-10); p < 0.001) with a focus on weakness, anxiety, overburdening of next-of-kin and dyspnea. More than 70% of patients died during index hospitalization, one third of these in a palliative care unit. This largest European multicenter investigation of LVAD-patients receiving specialist palliative care shows a late integration and high physical and psychosocial symptom burden. This study highlights the urgent need for earlier integration to identify and address poorly controlled symptoms. Further studies and educational efforts are needed to close the gap between guideline-recommendations and the current status quo.},

  abstract = {Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an exceptional physical situation and may lead to significant psychological, spiritual, and social distress in patients and their next of kin. Furthermore, clinicians might experience distress related to a CPR event. Specialist palliative care (sPC) integration could address these aspects but is not part of routine care. This study aimed to explore perspectives on sPC integration during and after CPR. A needs assessment for sPC, possible triggers indicating need, and implementation strategies were addressed. A multiprofessional qualitative semistructured focus group study was conducted in a German urban academic teaching hospital. Participants were clinicians (nursing staff, residents, and consultants) working in the emergency department and ICUs (internal medicine and surgical). The focus groups were recorded and subsequently transcribed. Data material was analyzed using the content-structuring content analysis according to Kuckartz. Seven focus groups with 18 participants in total were conducted online from July to November 2022. Six main categories (two to five subcategories) were identified: understanding (of palliative care and death), general CPR conditions (e.g., team, debriefing, and strains), prognosis (e.g., preexisting situation, use of extracorporeal support), next of kin (e.g., communication, presence during CPR), treatment plan (patient will and decision-making), and implementation of sPC (e.g., timing, trigger factors). Perceptions about the need for sPC to support during and after CPR depend on roles, areas of practice, and individual understanding of sPC. Although some participants perceive CPR itself as a trigger for sPC, others define, for example, pre-CPR-existing multimorbidity or complex family dynamics as possible triggers. Suggestions for implementation are multifaceted, especially communication by sPC is emphasized. Specific challenges of extracorporeal CPR need to be explored further. Overall, the focus groups show that the topic is considered relevant, and studies on outcomes are warranted.},

  abstract = {Practical skills training is an essential part of medical education. An important example is the training of Basic Life Support (BLS) skills, which are key to improve patient outcomes in life-threatening situations. However, despite practical training, BLS performance is often sub-optimal even among healthcare professionals and medical students. Finding more effective training methods is therefore of high importance. A promising method to enhance learning outcomes is reflective practice. The goal of the present study was to evaluate whether a short reflective practice intervention following standard BLS training (Peyton's 4-step approach) improves BLS training outcomes, reflected in higher BLS performance and higher self-confidence to perform BLS. 287 first-year medical students were randomly assigned to one of two BLS training conditions: 1) standard BLS training (ST), 2) ST followed by a 15-minute reflective practice exercise. Outcome parameters included objective BLS performance data assessed by a resuscitation manikin, and students' self-reported confidence in their BLS skills. Outcomes were assessed directly after the training (T0) and re-assessed one week later (T1). A two-way mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effect of the intervention on BLS performance and self-reported confidence. Significance was determined by two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The intervention group performed significantly more effective compressions at T1 and began significantly faster with performing their first chest compression at T0 and T1, in comparison to the control group. No significant differences between study groups regarding their self-reported confidence to perform BLS were observed. This research shows that standard BLS training accompanied with a simple, cost-effective reflective practice exercise can improve learners' BLS skill acquisition and retention. This shows that reflective practice has the potential to enhance practical skills training in medicine; yet, more empirical studies are needed to examine its broader applicability.},

The "ICU Support" team meeting concept aims to support intensive care unit (ICU) teams by promoting interprofessional communication, peer support, and patient safety by providing a structure for daily team meetings. This protocol describes a study to explore the effectiveness of "ICU Support" for patient- and staff-centered outcomes. ICU Support will be implemented at nine university hospitals located in Germany, following a two-arm randomized parallel group design with an intervention and a control condition and three data collection periods. In the intervention arm, leading ICU personnel (physicians and nurses) will be trained in ICU Support and implement the ICU Support elements into the daily work routine of their units upon completion of data collection period T0 (baseline). In the control arm, ICU Support will not be implemented until the completion of the data collection period T1 (1 month after study start). Until then, the regular daily schedule of the ICU teams will be maintained. The final data collection period (T2) will take place 4 months after the start of the study. Primary outcomes include the number of intensive care complications per patient during their ICU stay during T1 and the sick-related absence of ICU staff during T1. Secondary outcomes include, among others, the average severity of intensive care complications per patient and employee self-reported data regarding their teamwork and patient safety behaviors. The need for healthy and well-trained ICU staff is omnipresent; thus, structured and evidence-based interventions aimed at supporting ICU teams and facilitating patient safety are required. This multicenter study aims to explore the effectiveness of ICU Support for patient- and staff-centered outcomes. The insights derived from this study have the potential to significantly improve ICU patient safety, staff communication, and connectedness and decrease sickness-related expenses and social costs associated with high work demands among ICU staff.

However, there has been considerable skepticism as to whether H-PDI would be quantifiable, because it depends on the destruction of microbubbles and has more complex signal processing than gray scale imaging. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the concentration of microbubbles and the resulting H-PDI signals even under conditions where bubble destruction is most likely. Furthermore, we evaluated whether microbubbles of Levovist freely pass the microcirculation, which is a prerequisite for the assessment of myocardial blood flow. A strong positive correlation was found between the H-PDI signals and the amount of microbubbles up to the onset of acoustic shadowing (r = 0. 968, P<0.001). Time-intensity curves for H-PDI of air-filled microbubbles were compared with time-concentration curves of indocyanine green (ICG) in both a flow phantom and a working heart setup. The mean transit times (MTTs) through the myocardium of both agents were compared after a bolus injection into the left coronary artery. A close correlation was observed between 1/MTT and flow in both setups (r>0.98, P<0.0001). However, at high flow rates, the MTTs of the microbubbles were slightly, albeit not significantly, faster than those of indocyanine green. We conclude that microbubbles fulfill the prerequisites of free flowing tracers through the myocardium. Furthermore, H-PDI technology allows a reliable assessment of time-concentration curves of air-filled microbubbles up to the onset of acoustic shadowing.},

CSF contains hundreds of proteins, with concentrations reflecting ongoing (patho)physiological processes. This provides the opportunity to study many biological processes at the same time in patients. We studied whether Alzheimer's disease biological subtypes can be detected in CSF proteomics using the dual clustering technique non-negative matrix factorization. In two independent cohorts (EMIF-AD MBD and ADNI) we found that 705 (77% of 911 tested) proteins differed between Alzheimer's disease (defined as having abnormal amyloid, n = 425) and controls (defined as having normal CSF amyloid and tau and normal cognition, n = 127). Using these proteins for data-driven clustering, we identified three robust pathophysiological Alzheimer's disease subtypes within each cohort showing (i) hyperplasticity and increased BACE1 levels; (ii) innate immune activation; and (iii) blood-brain barrier dysfunction with low BACE1 levels. In both cohorts, the majority of individuals were labelled as having subtype 1 (80, 36% in EMIF-AD MBD; 117, 59% in ADNI), 71 (32%) in EMIF-AD MBD and 41 (21%) in ADNI were labelled as subtype 2, and 72 (32%) in EMIF-AD MBD and 39 (20%) individuals in ADNI were labelled as subtype 3. Genetic analyses showed that all subtypes had an excess of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (all P > 0.01). Additional pathological comparisons that were available for a subset in ADNI suggested that subtypes showed similar severity of Alzheimer's disease pathology, and did not differ in the frequencies of co-pathologies, providing further support that found subtypes truly reflect Alzheimer's disease heterogeneity. Compared to controls, all non-demented Alzheimer's disease individuals had increased risk of showing clinical progression (all P < 0.01). Compared to subtype 1, subtype 2 showed faster clinical progression after correcting for age, sex, level of education and tau levels (hazard ratio = 2.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 5.1; P = 0.01), and subtype 3 at trend level (hazard ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.0, 4.4; P = 0.06). Together, these results demonstrate the value of CSF proteomics in studying the biological heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease patients, and suggest that subtypes may require tailored therapy.},

In this prospective observational study we analyzed the association between knowledge and adherence in the chronic nonmalignant pain population. We included 96 patients treated with a new pharmacological prescription. During the initial visit (T0), demographic variables, pain intensity, knowledge of the prescription (name, dose, and frequency), self-reported adherence to the prescription, and general knowledge of pharmacological pain therapy (according to the Pain Knowledge Questionnaire, Dutch Language Version (PKQ-DLV) were recorded. During two follow-up visits (T1, T2), apart from demographics, these parameters were measured again. Adherence rates were 42%, 42%, and 46% at T0, T1 and T2, respectively. 53%, 59%, and 48% of patients had knowledge of their current prescription, and mean scores on the PKQ-DLV were 56, 55, and 52 percent of the maximum scores, respectively, at T0, T1 and T2. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis resulted in a significant contribution of knowledge of the prescription and of age to the prediction of adherence. Knowledge of the analgesic prescription is associated with adherence and significantly contributes to the prediction of adherence to analgesic therapy. An interventional study is needed to determine whether increasing knowledge will improve medication adherence and therapy outcome in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain.},

Assessment of the presence and severity of a neuropathic pain component (NePC) is key in diagnosing chronic pain patients. Low back pain (LBP) and neck and shoulder pain (NSP) are highly prevalent and clinically important medical and societal problems in which a NePC is frequently present. The more severe the NePC, the worse the course of the pain, its prognosis and the results of treatment. Reliable and standardised diagnosis of the NePC remains difficult to achieve. Standardized and validated screening tools may help to reliably identify the NePC in individual chronic pain patients. The aim of this study is to validate the Dutch language versions of the PainDETECT Questionnaire (PDQ-Dlv) and the 'Douleur Neuropathique 4 Questions' (DN4-Dlv) for use in primary and specialist medical care settings to screen for a NePC in patients with chronic pain due to (1) LBP, (2) NSP or (3) known peripheral nerve damage (PND). The study design is cross-sectional to assess the validity of the PDQ-Dlv and the DN4-Dlv with 2 weeks follow-up for test-retest reliability and 3 months follow-up for monitoring and prognosis. 438 patients with chronic pain due to (1) LBP, (2) NSP or (3) PND. will be included in this study. Based on the IASP definition of neuropathic pain, two physicians will independently assess whether the patient has a NEPC or not. This result will be compared with the outcome of the PDQ-Dlv & DN4-Dlv, the grading system for neuropathic pain, bed side examination and quantitative sensory testing. This study will further collect data regarding prevalence of NePC, general health status, mental health status, functioning, pain attribution and quality of life. The rationale for this study is to provide detailed information on the clinimetric quality of the PDQ-Dlv and DN4-Dlv in Dutch speaking countries. Our innovative multi-factorial approach should help achieve more reliable diagnosis and quantification of a NePC in patients with chronic pain. The Netherlands National Trial Register (NTR3030).},

Total costs per patient did not significantly differ between the groups (+€568, 95% CI -€254 to €1391, p=0.175). Regarding the costs per item, a difference of €309 per patient (95% CI €29 to €588, p=0.030) was found in favour of the MD model regarding length of stay. Personnel costs per patient for the provider who is primarily responsible for medical care on the ward were lower on the wards in the PA/MD model (-€11, 95% CI -€16 to -€6, p<0.01).

DNA methylation in whole blood captures genetic and environmental influences and is assessed in transethnic meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of serum urate (discovery, n = 12,474, replication, n = 5522). The 100 replicated, epigenome-wide significant (p < 1.1E-7) CpGs explain 11.6% of the serum urate variance. At SLC2A9, the serum urate locus with the largest effect in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), five CpGs are associated with SLC2A9 gene expression. Four CpGs at SLC2A9 have significant causal effects on serum urate levels and/or gout, and two of these partly mediate the effects of urate-associated GWAS variants. In other genes, including SLC7A11 and PHGDH, 17 urate-associated CpGs are associated with conditions defining metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these CpGs may represent a blood DNA methylation signature of cardiometabolic risk factors. This study demonstrates that EWAS can provide new insights into GWAS loci and the correlation of serum urate with other complex traits.},

It can occur in a balanced or unbalanced form and as a sole abnormality is associated with an intermediate prognosis. Additionally, this translocation is observed in the context of hyperdiploid B-ALL, in which case it is associated with a poor prognosis. However, due to different translocation partner genes at chromosomes 1 and 19, distinct subtypes of hyperdiploid B-ALL with t(1;19)/der(19)t(1;19) are recognized based on the presence or absence of the TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene, but the cytogenetic and etiologic differences between the two remain understudied. We report a case of an adult with a history of relapsed precursor B-ALL whose conventional cytogenetics showed an abnormal female karyotype with both hyperdiploidy and a t(1;19)(q23;p13). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on previously G-banded metaphases using the LSI TCF3/PBX1 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe confirmed the presence of the TCF3-PBX1 gene fusion. This particular pattern with a TCF3-PBX1 fusion within the context of a hyperdiploid karyotype is seen in B-ALL and is usually associated with a poor outcome. This case is one of only a few cases with both hyperdiploidy and a confirmed TCF3-PBX1 fusion, demonstrating the importance of using FISH for proper molecular classification of these cases in order to distinguish them from those with hyperdiploidy but no TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene. Such molecular studies may provide insight into the precise differences between TCF3-PBX1 positive and negative hyperdiploid B-ALL bearing the t(1;19)(q23;p13).},

We analyzed the effect of DAPT on 5-year all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and cardiovascular readmission or mortality in a cohort of 1-year survivor STEMI patients. A total of 3107 patients with the diagnosis of STEMI were included: 93% of them were discharged on DAPT, a therapy that persisted in 275 high-risk patients at 5 years. Cardiovascular mortality in patients on single antiplatelet therapy vs DAPT at 5 years was 1.4% vs 3.6% (P <.01), respectively, whereas noncardiovascular mortality was 3.3% vs 5.8% (P=.049) at 5 years. Cardiovascular readmission or mortality in patients with single antiplatelet therapy vs DAPT was 11.4% vs 46.5% (P <.001). Extended DAPT was independently associated with worse 5-year all-cause mortality (HR, 2.16; 95%CI, 1.40-3.33), cardiovascular mortality (HR, 2.83; 95%CI, 1.37-5.84), and cardiovascular readmission or mortality (HR, 5.20; 95%CI, 3.96-6.82). These findings were confirmed in propensity score matching and inverse probability weighting analyses. Our results suggest the hypothesis that, in 1-year STEMI survivors, extending DAPT up to 5 years in high-risk patients does not improve their long-term prognosis.},

Although numerous critical regulatory kinases and phosphatases have been identified in the myocardium, the intracellular mechanism for temporal regulation of signaling duration and intensity remains obscure. In the nonmyocyte context, control of folding, activity, and stability of proteins is mediated by the prolyl isomerase Pin1, but the role of Pin1 in the heart is unknown. To establish the role of Pin1 in the heart. Here, we show that either genetic deletion or cardiac overexpression of Pin1 blunts hypertrophic responses induced by transaortic constriction and consequent cardiac failure in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that Pin1 directly binds to Akt, mitogen activated protein kinase (MEK), and Raf-1 in cultured cardiomyocytes after hypertrophic stimulation. Furthermore, loss of Pin1 leads to diminished hypertrophic signaling of Akt and MEK, whereas overexpression of Pin1 increases Raf-1 phosphorylation on the autoinhibitory site Ser259, leading to reduced MEK activation. Collectively, these data support a role for Pin1 as a central modulator of the intensity and duration of 2 major hypertrophic signaling pathways, thereby providing a novel target for regulation and control of cardiac hypertrophy.},

Redo antireflux surgery in GERD and hiatal hernia is known for higher morbidity and mortality. This study aims to evaluate conventional versus robot-assisted laparoscopic redo antireflux surgery, with the objective to detect possible advantages for the robot-assisted approach. A single institute cohort of 75 patients who underwent either conventional laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic redo surgery for recurrent GERD or severe dysphagia between 2008 and 2013 were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, medical history, procedural data, hospital stay, complications and outcome were prospectively gathered. The main indications for redo surgery were dysphagia, pyrosis or a combination of both in combination with a proven anatomic abnormality. The mean time to redo surgery was 1.9 and 2.0 years after primary surgery for the conventional and robot-assisted groups, respectively. The number of conversions was lower in the robot-assisted group compared to conventional laparoscopy (1/45 vs. 5/30, p = 0.035) despite a higher proportion of patients with previous surgery by laparotomy (9/45 vs. 1/30, p = 0.038). Median hospital stay was reduced by 1 day (3 vs. 4, p = 0.042). There were no differences in mortality, complications or outcome. Robotic support, when available, can be regarded beneficial in redo surgery for GERD and hiatal hernia. Results of this observational study suggest technical feasibility for minimal-invasive robot-assisted redo surgery after open primary antireflux surgery, a reduced number of conversions and shorter hospital stay.},

  abstract = {The presence of a hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease often presents with severe, disabling symptoms and is known to result into a poor quality-of-life for many patients. Nevertheless, it’s often seen by patients and physicians alike as an ailment to be treated by antacids, not as serious disease warranting surgery.  
  While most hiatal hernia are straightforward, in some rare cases the pancreas herniates along with the other organs into the thoracic cavity. Little is known about how to proceed surgically. Furthermore, some patients are hindered in their daily life by symptoms of delayed gastric emptying. Antireflux surgery is known to enhance gastric emptying speeds in most cases. Some patients, however, see their gastric emptying worsened. The mechanism behind this phenomenon remains mostly unclear.  
  When a hiatal hernia recurs or symptoms persist following primary antireflux surgery, a whole battery of diagnostic tests are done to find the mechanism of failure and therefore also the optimal mode of treatment. We hypothesize that computed tomography (CT) scanning of the gastroesphageal junction offers sufficient information to classify the underlying mechanism of failure.
  Current treatment of hiatal hernia is largely standardized in the Netherlands. Most centers perform partial laparoscopic fundoplications. Some centers, however, see benefits in using robotic assistance.  
  And finally, the question remains on how best to treat those patients with severe symptoms and poor quality-of-life following (multiple) previous failed antireflux surgeries and are currently left without any treatment options.  
  The aims of this thesis are to find out why the number of referrals for surgery remain lacking in the Netherlands, to describe our experience with intrathoracic herniation of the pancreas, to find the incidence of delayed gastric emptying in patients with large and small hiatal hernia, to describe the effects of surgery on gastric motility, to look at the value of CT-scanning in patients with recurrent disease, to look at the benefits of robotic assistance in primary and redo antireflux surgery, and to describe the development of a novel robot assisted transthoracic minimal-invasive approach for redo-antireflux surgery.},

  abstract = {Up to 30% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) develop from sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). Within the serrated neoplasia pathway, at least two principally distinct oncogenetic routes exist generating microsatellite-stable and microsatellite-instable CRCs, respectively. Aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) is found early in the serrated pathway and might play a role in both oncogenetic routes. We studied a cohort of 23 SSLs with a small focus (<10 mm) of dysplasia or cancer, 10 of which were MLH1 deficient and 13 MLH1 proficient. By comparing, for each SSL, the methylation status of (1) the region of dysplasia or cancer (SSL-D), (2) the nondysplastic SSL (SSL), and (3) adjacent normal mucosa, differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) were assessed both genome-wide as well as in a tumor-suppressor gene-focused approach. By comparing DNAm of MLH1-deficient SSL-Ds with their corresponding SSLs, we identified five DMRs, including those annotating for PRDM2 and, not unexpectedly, MLH1. PRDM2 gene promotor methylation was associated with MLH1 expression status, as it was largely hypermethylated in MLH1-deficient SSL-Ds and hypomethylated in MLH1-proficient SSL-Ds. Significantly increased DNAm levels of PRDM2 and MLH1, in particular at 'critical' MLH1 probe sites, were to some extent already visible in SSLs as compared to normal mucosa (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, p < 0.0001, respectively). No DMRs, nor DMPs, were identified for SSLs destined to evolve into MLH1-proficient SSL-Ds. Our data indicate that, within both arms of the serrated CRC pathway, the majority of the epigenetic alterations are introduced early during SSL formation. Promoter hypermethylation of PRDM2 and MLH1 on the other hand specifically initiates in SSLs destined to transform into MLH1-deficient CRCs suggesting that the fate of SSLs may not necessarily result from a stochastic process but possibly is already imprinted and predisposed.},

  abstract = {Chemical stimuli, generally constituted by small volatile organic molecules, are extremely important for the survival of different insect species. In the course of evolution, insects have developed very sophisticated biochemical systems for the binding and the delivery of specific semiochemicals to their cognate membrane-bound receptors. Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are a class of small soluble proteins present at high concentration in insect chemosensory organs; they are supposed to be involved in carrying the chemical messages from the environment to the chemosensory receptors. In this paper, we report on the solution structure of CSPsg4, a chemosensory protein from the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria, which is expressed in the antennae and other chemosensory organs. The 3D NMR structure revealed an overall fold consisting of six alpha-helices, spanning residues 13-18, 20-31, 40-54, 62-78, 80-90, and 97-103, connected by loops which in some cases show dihedral angles typical of beta-turns. As in the only other chemosensory protein whose structure has been solved so far, namely, CSP from the moth Mamestra brassicae, four helices are arranged to form a V-shaped motif; another helix runs across the two V's, and the last one is packed against the external face. Analysis of the tertiary structure evidenced multiple hydrophobic cavities which could be involved in ligand binding. In fact, incubation of the protein with a natural ligand, namely, oleamide, produced substantial changes to the NMR spectra, suggesting extensive conformational transitions upon ligand binding.},

Substrate selectivity analysis confirmed Psf1 as being endo-acting and indicated that the enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of α(1 → 3)-glycosidic fucoidan linkages. Psf1 had temperature optimum of 10-30 °C but retained activity at 1 °C. Structural modeling indicated similarity to the crystal structure of P5A_FcnA (Psychromonas sp.

These interactions are non-competitive and can occur simultaneously through distinct interaction surfaces. Interestingly, the XPA binding by ERCC1 and the catalytic function of XPF are dependent on a structurally homologous region of the two proteins. Although these regions are strictly conserved in each protein family, amino acid composition and surface characteristics are distinct. We discuss the possibility that after XPF gene duplication, the redundant ERCC1 central domain acquired novel functions, thereby increasing the fidelity of eukaryotic DNA repair.},

Statistically significant factors for conversion were found to be LLR of the postero-superior (P-S) segments (SI, SIVa; SVII; SVIII) (12.7% converted versus 2.5% non-converted groups, P = 0.01) and a major compared with a minor hepatectomy (15.2% vs. 4.6%, P = 0.02 respectively).

According to Dindo's classification, complications were recorded as grade I (n = 20); grade II (6); grade III (11) and grade IV(1) events (total morbidity rate of 14%). Univariate analysis identified a major hepatectomy and resection involving P-S segments as prognostic factors for conversion whereas multivariate analysis identified the latter as an independent risk factor [P = 0.003, odds ratio (OR) = 5.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-18.8].

Autosomal-dominant OPMD is caused by a short (GCG)(8-13) expansions within the first exon of the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 gene (PABPN1), leading to an expanded polyalanine tract in the mutated protein. Expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble aggregates in the nuclei of skeletal muscle fibres. In order to gain insight into the different physiological processes affected in OPMD muscles, we have used a transgenic mouse model of OPMD (A17.1) and performed transcriptomic studies combined with a detailed phenotypic characterization of this model at three time points. The transcriptomic analysis revealed a massive gene deregulation in the A17.1 mice, among which we identified a significant deregulation of pathways associated with muscle atrophy. Using a mathematical model for progression, we have identified that one-third of the progressive genes were also associated with muscle atrophy. Functional and histological analysis of the skeletal muscle of this mouse model confirmed a severe and progressive muscular atrophy associated with a reduction in muscle strength. Moreover, muscle atrophy in the A17.1 mice was restricted to fast glycolytic fibres, containing a large number of intranuclear inclusions (INIs). The soleus muscle and, in particular, oxidative fibres were spared, even though they contained INIs albeit to a lesser degree. These results demonstrate a fibre-type specificity of muscle atrophy in this OPMD model. This study improves our understanding of the biological pathways modified in OPMD to identify potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.},

Laparoscopy was performed in a total of 126 patients with a median time interval of 7 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 3-13 weeks). Of 64 patients who successfully underwent both THL and laparoscopy, concordant findings were found in 53 women and discordant results in 11 women, 6 of which were caused by tubal spasm. Sensitivity of THL in detecting abnormalities was 100% and specificity was 22.2%, with a likelihood ratio of 1.29. THL in an outpatient setting can detect anatomical abnormalities comparable to the more invasive reference standard diagnostic laparoscopy.

We conclude that: first, the presence of cortical-subcortical lesions in part accounts for the occurrence of seizures in MS patients; second, due to the substantial overlap of MR imaging scores between cases and controls the ultimate use of these MR imaging findings in the management of individual patients or in the organizations of trials should depend on the expected benefit of the treatment. If the benefit is only moderate or not known a cautious approach with exclusion of cases showing a substantial cortical-subcortical lesion load on MR imaging seems appropriate in trials with drugs, like 4-aminopyridine, that lower the epileptic threshold.},

These power-calculations might not be applicable to the active relapsing-remitting patient who is preferably included in trials. In order to reevaluate the power-calculations for MRI in the monitoring of treatment in strictly relapsing-remitting MS and to compare the power of different trial designs we studied 12 relapsing-remitting MS patients prospectively for a median period of 12 months using monthly clinical assessments and gadolinium-enhanced MRI. A median number of two clinical relapses/patient occurred of which a median of one was treated with steroids. A median of 1.59 new lesions/scan/patient was detected (range 0-8). The total number of new active lesions correlated significantly with study period relapses (SRCC = 0.72, P = 0.023). Computer simulations using the bootstrap technique yielded mostly lower power values for a parallel groups design than in previous studies except for short follow-periods in larger samples. In this-sample the open cross-over design was found to be between 20 and 40% more powerful. Results of power-calculations are clearly sample dependent implying that for treatment trial monitoring using MRI in relapsing-remitting MS conservative sample size estimates are to be used. In an active patient group open cross-over trial designs could be a very powerful alternative to parallel groups design.},

The questionnaire is scored as a mean of the 9 items on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning. Composite and individual item scores were compared between groups using the analysis of variance. In total, 916 questionnaires were completed from patients with acute MK (n = 84), nonacute MK (n = 30), MK with a corneal transplant (n = 21), from controls seen in a satellite comprehensive ophthalmology clinic (n = 528), and controls seen at a subspecialty ophthalmology clinic (n = 253). The mean NEI VFQ-9 composite scores per group were 66.6 (SD = 26.8), 78.1 (SD = 17.1), 58.6 (SD =21.6), 88.0 (SD = 10.2), and 83.5 (SD = 13.0), respectively (P < 0.0001). Both patients with acute MK and patients with MK requiring transplant reported significantly worse function than nonacute MK, comprehensive, and specialty patients. Patients with nonacute MK reported significantly worse function than comprehensive control patients (all Tukey-adjusted P < 0.05). Patients who had or eventually require corneal transplant for management of their MK report worse visual function than patients with nonacute MK.

Peamaclein is a recently identified 7 kDa peach allergen that has been associated with severe allergic reactions in sensitive subjects. This protein represents the first component of a new allergen family, which has no 3D structure available yet. Here, we report the first experimental data on the 3D-structure of Peamaclein. Almost 75% of the backbone resonances, including two helical stretches in the N-terminal region, and four out of six cysteine pairs have been assigned by 2D-NMR using a natural protein sample. Simulated gastrointestinal digestion experiments have highlighted that Peamaclein is even more resistant to digestion than the peach major allergen Pru p 3. Only the heat-denatured protein becomes sensitive to intestinal proteases. Similar to Pru p 3, Peamaclein keeps its native 3D-structure up to 90°C, but it becomes unfolded at temperatures of 100-120°C. Heat denaturation affects the immunological properties of both peach allergens, which lose at least partially their IgE-binding epitopes. In conclusion, the data collected in this study provide a first set of information on the molecular properties of Peamaclein. Future studies could lead to the possible use of the denatured form of this protein as a vaccine, and of the inclusion of cooked peach in the diet of subjects allergic to Peamaclein.},

Unique mono-cysteinyl-FAD oxidases with positively-charged active sites, suited to oxidise OGs, were discovered in Phytophthora sojae. The P. sojae OG oxidase genes, prevalent in this genus, were co-transcribed with pectin-degradation counterparts during early infection of soybean. Single OG oxidase knockouts significantly decreased P. sojae biomass in planta, potentially linking OG oxidases to virulence. We propose that oxidation by AA7 enzymes impairs the elicitor activity of OGs, potentially contributing to stealth Oomycota infection. Oxidation of OGs unravels a previously unknown microbial mechanism that contributes to evade plant immune-response against pathogens. Our findings highlight a unique oxidase architecture and hitherto unexplored targets for bioprotection from major plant pathogens.},

Qualitative methods were used to understand the experience of UAB from a patient perspective, in a purposive sample of male (n=29) and female (n=15) patients aged 27-88 yr (mean: 64 yr), diagnosed with a primary diagnosis of detrusor underactivity, with or without coexisting urological conditions. Semistructured interviews were conducted in Bristol, UK. Male and female patients reported a variety of lower urinary tract symptoms and associated impact on quality of life. Storage symptoms of nocturia, increased daytime frequency, and urgency, and the voiding symptoms of slow stream, hesitancy, and straining were reported by over half of the patients. A sensation of incomplete emptying and postmicturition dribble were also frequently described. Most had a post void residual >30ml (n=34, 77%, median: 199ml) with many reporting urinary tract infections, a history of self-catheterisation, and some experiencing occasional acute retention episodes. These symptoms and signs can have a broad impact on quality of life including having to plan their daily activities around the location of toilets, disruption to sleep, social life, and associated effect on family and friends. Knowledge of the lived experience of UAB obtained in the current study will be used for the development of a new patient reported outcome measure and help inform the current working definition of UAB.

Thus, tumors growing on mice that lack the pattern recognition receptor TLR4 or the purinergic receptor P2RX7 fail to respond to chemotherapy with anthracyclins or oxaliplatin in conditions in which the same neoplasms growing on immunocompetent mice would do so. Similarly, the therapeutic efficacy (measured as progression-free survival) of adjuvant chemotherapy with anthracyclins is reduced in breast cancer patients bearing loss-of-function alleles of TLR4 or P2RX7. TLR4 loss-of-function alleles also have a negative impact on the therapeutic outcome of oxaliplatin in colorectal cancer patients. Here, we report that loss-of-function TLR4 and P2RX7 alleles do not affect overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, irrespective of the administration and type of chemotherapy. The intrinsic characteristics of NSCLC (which near-to-always is chemoresistant and associated with poor prognosis) and/or the type of therapy that is employed to treat this malignancy (which near-to-always is based on cisplatin) may explain why two genes that affect the immune response to dying cells fail to influence the clinical progression of NSCLC patients.},

  abstract = {Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common tumor of the hand. This malignancy requires unique treatment considerations; the surgeon and patient must balance retention of maximal functional capacity of the hand and minimization of the risk of recurrence and metastasis. Digital-sparing and digital-sacrificing therapies should be considered. Chance for cure, recurrence and metastasis risk, cosmetic concerns, and functional concerns should be addressed on a case-by-case basis. We report a case of a fifty-three-year-old man with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of his non-dominant hand. Ulceration and rapid growth of a long-standing lesion of the dorsal hand prompted evaluation and treatment. Over the course of a year, three separate surgeries including digital amputations and metacarpal resections were required to manage this recurrent and invasive malignancy. Seven years post-operatively, our patient retained a full, painless range of motion arc of the left thumb and ability to grip utilizing a functional brace. Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the hand is not always straightforward. High rates of local recurrence require negative margins and diligent postoperative surveillance. Digital sparing therapy should be considered to minimize functional impairment and maximize cosmesis. However, aggressive treatment and amputation must be considered for advanced disease and if pursued, should focus on maximization of functional capacity as one of the treatment goals.},

  abstract = {γ-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor agonists are known to cause involuntary muscle movements. The mechanism of these movements is not known, and its relationship to depth of anesthesia monitoring is unclear. We have explored the effect of involuntary muscle movement on the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for the GABAA receptor agonist ABP-700 and its effects on the Bispectral Index (BIS) as well as the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scores. Observations from 350 individuals (220 men, 130 women) were analyzed, comprising 6,312 ABP-700 concentrations, 5,658 ABP-700 metabolite (CPM-acid) concentrations, 25,745 filtered BIS values, and 6,249 MOAA/S scores, and a recirculatory model developed. Various subject covariates and pretreatment with an opioid or a benzodiazepine were explored as covariates. Relationships between BIS and MOAA/S models and involuntary muscle movements were examined. The final model shows that the pharmacokinetics of ABP-700 are characterized by small compartmental volumes and rapid clearance. The BIS model incorporates an effect-site for BIS suppression and a secondary excitatory/disinhibitory effect-site associated with a risk of involuntary muscle movements. The secondary effect-site has a threshold that decreases with age. The MOAA/S model did not show excitatory effects. The GABAA receptor agonist ABP-700 shows the expected suppressive effects for BIS and MOAA/S, but also disinhibitory effects for BIS associated with involuntary muscle movements and reduced by pretreatment. Our model provides information about involuntary muscle movements that may be useful to improve depth of anesthesia monitoring for GABAA receptor agonists.},

A systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted for all studies published between January 2015 and March 2025 reporting RTS or return to preinjury level (RTPL) following surgical treatment for anterior shoulder instability. Exclusion criteria included non-English studies, studies reporting less than a 2-year follow-up, and studies reporting any shoulder instability other than anterior, including atraumatic instability. The risk of bias was assessed, and data were extracted. Heterogeneity in procedure-specific RTS outcomes was qualitatively assessed through subgroup analyses of study, patient, and surgical characteristics. A total of 123 studies encompassing 10,992 athletes were included. Across 9,581 patients, RTS rates ranged from 50% to 100%, and RTPL ranged from 19.4% to 100%. RTS was most consistent following open iliac crest (100%) and open Bankart repair (91.6%-100%), while wider ranges were observed after arthroscopic Bankart (50%-100%) and open Latarjet (50%-100%). RTPL exhibited rates of 100% after open iliac crest and 19.4% to 97.1% after open Latarjet. Female athletes had higher and more consistent RTS (91.4%-100%) and RTPL (74.1%-76.9%) compared to males (RTS, 73.9%-100%; RTPL, 39.4%-97.1%). Ranges of RTS and RTPL narrowed in studies with a prospective design (RTS, 87%-98%; RTPL, 38%-97%), revision procedures (RTS, 77.9%-100%; RTPL, 42.9%-95.4%), and among elite athletes (RTS, 81.8%-100%). Patients with >20% glenoid bone loss exhibited narrower RTPL (78.3%-95.4%) than those with <20% (70%-100%). Sport type, athlete level, and bone defect tracking status further influenced RTS variability. Anterior shoulder stabilization procedures lead to high, though varied, reported RTS and return to preinjury rates across all studied cohorts. Ranges of RTS rates are influenced by procedure type, clinical follow-up duration, athletic level, and revision surgery status. Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV evidence.},

Before constructing a classification rule, we attempted to pre-process the data and to select features of the spectra that were likely due to true biological signals (i.e., peptides/proteins). As a result, we selected a set of 92 features. To construct the classification rule, we considered eight methods for selecting a subset of the features, combined with seven classification methods. The performance of the resulting 56 combinations was evaluated by using a cross-validation procedure with 1000 re-sampled data sets. The best result, as indicated by the lowest overall misclassification rate, was obtained by using the whole set of 92 features as the input for a support-vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. This method was therefore used to construct the classification rule. For the training data set, the total error rate for the classification rule, as estimated by using leave-one-out cross-validation, was equal to 0.16, with the sensitivity and specificity equal to 0.87 and 0.82, respectively.},

  abstract = {The process of monoisotopic mass determination, i.e., nomination of the correct peak of an isotopically resolved group of peptide peaks as a monoisotopic peak, requires prior information about the isotopic distribution of the peptide. This points immediately to the difficulty of monoisotopic mass determination, whereas a single mass spectrum does not contain information about the atomic composition of a peptide and therefore the isotopic distribution of the peptide remains unknown. To solve this problem a technique is required, which is able to estimate the isotopic distribution given the information of a single mass spectrum. Senko et al. calculated the average isotopic distribution for any mass peptide via the multinomial expansion (Yergey 1983), using a scaled version of the average amino acid Averagine (Senko et al. 1995). Another method, introduced by Breen et al., approximates the result of the multinomial expansion by a Poisson model (Breen et al. 2000). Although both methods perform well, they have their specific limitations. In this manuscript, we propose an alternative method for the prediction of the isotopic distribution based on a model for consecutive ratios of peaks from the isotopic distribution, similar in spirit to the approach introduced by Gay et al. (1999). The presented method is computationally simple and accurate in predicting the expected isotopic distribution. Further, we extend our method to estimate the isotopic distribution of sulphur-containing peptides. This is important because the naturally occurring isotopes of sulphur have an impact on the isotopic distribution of a peptide.},

The resulting data were reconstructed using an iterative algorithm with corrections for system imperfections such as trajectory deviations and B Water excitation and the model-based iterative reconstruction improved image quality. The BOLD-related signal changes increased with longer TE and longer TR. We observed an increase in thermal noise performance at lower TE and higher TR. However, signal stability deteriorates at higher TE and TR. Therefore, optimized protocols used shorter TE and moderately long TR to maximize the sensitivity and speed. Reproducible activations were detected along the gray-matter gyri in the submillimeter protocols with a median signal change of approximately 4% across subjects. Three-dimensional stack-of-spirals enables passband balanced SSFP functional imaging at a much higher spatial and temporal scale, compared with conventional spoiled gradient-echo train sequences.},

The mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase is a central signaling hub that controls mRNA translation in cardiomyocytes; however, a direct link between mTOR signaling and RNA-binding proteins in the heart has not been established. Integrative transcriptome and translatome analysis revealed mTOR dependent translational upregulation of the RNA binding protein Ybx1 during early pathological remodeling independent of mRNA levels. Ybx1 is necessary for pathological cardiomyocyte growth by regulating protein synthesis. To identify the molecular mechanisms how Ybx1 regulates cellular growth and protein synthesis, we identified mRNAs bound to Ybx1. We discovered that eucaryotic elongation factor 2 (Eef2) mRNA is bound to Ybx1, and its translation is upregulated during cardiac hypertrophy dependent on Ybx1 expression. Eef2 itself is sufficient to drive pathological growth by increasing global protein translation. Finally, Ybx1 depletion in vivo preserved heart function during pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Thus, activation of mTORC1 links pathological signaling cascades to altered gene expression regulation by activation of Ybx1 which in turn promotes translation through increased expression of Eef2.},

Adulteration, substitution, dilution, and incorrect labeling of seafood products are fraudulent practices that violate consumer safety. In this context, developing sensitive, robust, and high-throughput molecular tools for food and feed authentication is becoming crucial for regulatory purposes. Analytical approaches such as proteomics mass spectrometry have shown promise in detecting incorrectly labeled products. For the application of these tools, genome information is crucial, but currently, for many marine species of commercial importance, such information is unavailable. However, when combining proteomic analysis with spectral library matching, commercially important fish species were successfully identified, differentiated, and quantified in pure muscle samples and mixtures, even when genome information was scarce. This study further tested the previously developed spectral library matching approach to differentiate between 29 fish species from the North Sea and examined samples including individual fish, laboratory-prepared mixtures and commercial products. For authenticating libraries generated from 29 fish species, fresh muscle samples from the fish samples were matched against the reference spectral libraries. Species of the fresh fish samples were correctly authenticated using the spectral library approach. The same result was obtained when evaluating the laboratory-prepared mixtures. Furthermore, processed commercial products containing mixtures of two or three fish species were matched against these reference spectral libraries to test the accuracy and robustness of this method for authentication of fish species. The results indicated that the method is suitable for the authentication of fish species from highly processed samples such as fish cakes and burgers. The study shows that current and future challenges in food and feed authentication can efficiently be tackled by reference spectral libraries method when prospecting new resources in the Arctic.},

The Hamiltonians for the D and J interactions have the same functional form; thus, the experimentally measured apparent spin-spin coupling constant corresponds to a sum of J and D. In biomolecular NMR studies, it is commonly presumed that the dipolar contributions to Js are effectively canceled due to random molecular tumbling. However, in strong magnetic fields, such as those employed for NMR analysis, the tumbling of NA fragments is anisotropic because the inherent magnetic susceptibility of NAs causes an interaction with the external magnetic field. This motional anisotropy is responsible for non-zero D contributions to Js. Here, we calculated the field-induced D contributions to 33 structurally relevant scalar coupling constants as a function of magnetic field strength, temperature and NA fragment size. We identified two classes of Js, namely (1)JCH and (3)JHH couplings, whose quantitative interpretation is notably biased by NA motional anisotropy. For these couplings, the magnetic field-induced dipolar contributions were found to exceed the typical experimental error in J-coupling determinations by a factor of two or more and to produce considerable over- or under-estimations of the J coupling-related torsion angles, especially at magnetic field strengths >12 T and for NA fragments longer than 12 bp. We show that if the non-zero D contributions to J are not properly accounted for, they might cause structural artifacts/bias in NA studies that use solution NMR spectroscopy.},

We describe a 7-year-old patient with possible SMA scheduled for a Grice-arthrodesis. Because of previous prolonged postoperative drowsiness and poor oral intake, we decided to use an epidural technique with sevoflurane sedation and spontaneous ventilation to avoid the use of muscle relaxants and systemic opioids and consequently admission to the intensive care unit. After 3 days, the epidural analgesia was stopped and the patient regained her preoperative motor function within 5 h.

First high throughput sequencing (HTS) studies on OA-MZL showed inconsistent results and the distribution of mutations in reactive lymphoid lesions of this anatomic region has not yet been sufficiently addressed. We characterized OAL and lymphoid lesions of the OA by targeted HTS. The study included 34 OA-MZL, 11 chronic conjunctivitis, five mature small cell B-cell lymphomas spreading to the OA, five diseases with increase of IgG4+ plasma cells, three Burkitt lymphomas (BL), three diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), three mantle cell lymphomas, three idiopathic orbital inflammations/orbital pseudo tumors (PT), and three OA lymphoid hyperplasia. All cases were negative for Chlamydia. The mutational number was highest in BL and lowest in PT. The most commonly (and exclusively) mutated gene in OA-MZL was TNFAIP3 (10 of 34 cases). Altogether, 20 out of 34 patients harbored mutually exclusive mutations of either TNFAIP3, BCL10, MYD88, ATM, BRAF, or NFKBIE, or nonexclusive mutations of IRF8, TNFRSF14, KLHL6, and TBL1XR1, all encoding for NK-κB pathway compounds or regulators. Thirteen patients (38%) had, to a great part, mutually exclusive mutations of chromatin modifier-encoding genes: KMT2D, CREBBP, BCL7A, DNMT3A, EP300, or HIST1H1E. Only four patients harbored co-occurring mutations of genes encoding for NK-κB compounds and chromatin modifiers. Finally, PTEN, KMT2D, PRDM1, and HIST1H2BK mutations were observable in reactive lymphoid lesions too, while such instances were devoid of NF-κB compound mutations and/or mutations of acetyltransferase-encoding genes. In conclusion, 80% of OA-MZL display mutations of either NK-κB compounds or chromatin modifiers. Lymphoid lesions of the OA bearing NF-κB compound mutations and/or mutations of acetyltransferase-encoding genes highly likely represent lymphomas.},

The effects of 1 year of treatment with oral or transdermal administration of estrogen (plus cyproterone) and transdermal or IM application of testosterone on serum lipid levels and blood pressure (BP) were assessed in transgender persons. In this prospective, observational substudy of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence, measurements were performed before and after 12 months of HT in 242 transwomen and 188 transmen from 2010 to 2017. Mean values are reported. In transmen, HT increased diastolic BP (2.5%; 95% CI, 0.6 to 4.4) and levels of total cholesterol (TC; 4.1%; 95% CI, 1.5 to 6.6), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C; 13.0%; 95% CI, 9.2 to 16.8), and triglycerides (36.9%; 95% CI, 29.8 to 44.1); high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels decreased (HDL-C; 10.8%; 95% CI, -14.0 to -7.6). In transwomen, HT slightly decreased BP (systolic BP, -2.6%, 95% CI, -4.2 to -1.0; diastolic BP, -2.2%, 95% CI, -4.0 to -0.4) and decreased levels of TC (-9.7%; 95% CI, -11.3 to -8.1), LDL-C (-6.0%; 95% CI, -8.6 to 3.6), HDL-C (-9.3%; 95% CI, -11.4 to -7.3), and triglycerides (-10.2%; 95% CI, -14.5 to -5.9). Unfavorable changes in lipid profile were observed in transmen; a favorable effect was noted in transwomen. HT effects on BP were negligible. Long-term studies are warranted to assess whether and to what extent HT in trans individuals results in a differential effect on cardiovascular disease outcomes.},

Four dimensions define a model of intimately related value-pillars: personal value, allocative value, technical value, and societal value. VBHC is mostly applied in common diseases, and there are fundamental challenges in applying VBHC strategies to low volume, high complex healthcare situations, such as rare diseases, including inherited metabolic disorders. This article summarizes current practices at various academical domains (i.e., research, healthcare, education, and training) that (aim to) increase values at various value-pillars for persons with liver glycogen storage diseases or fatty acid oxidation disorders and their families. Future perspectives may include facilitating virtual networks to function as integrated practice units, improving measurement of outcomes, and creating information technology platforms to overcome the ethical, legal, societal, and technical challenges of data sharing for healthcare and research purposes.},

This is a monocentre, retrospective, observational mixed method study of patients with hepatic GSD or IKH treated at the Beatrix Children's Hospital Groningen, who had been referred to SeysCentra, a specialist centre for the treatment of eating problems. Additionally, a systematic literature review has been performed to identify instruments to quantify patient-reported outcome measures of psychosocial problems in hepatic GSD patients. Sixteen patients from 12 families were included with ages ranging between 3 and 24 years. Five out of sixteen patients were diagnosed with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder and six patients showed characteristics of this disorder. Fourteen patients experienced sleeping problems, and 11 out of 12 parent couples experienced stress about the illness of their child. We subsequently identified 26 instruments to quantify patient-reported outcome measures for GSD patients. This study demonstrates that GSD patients can develop Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder influencing quality of life at multiple domains. The identification of instruments to assess psychosocial wellbeing is an important step towards a standard set of patient-reported outcome measures.},

About 50% of the consumed 13-L-hydroperoxylinoleic acid was converted into oxodienoic acids regardless of the initial ratio of the two substrates. A linear inhibition by both linoleic acid and 13-L-hydroperoxylinoleic acid was observed in the concentration range studied, which is on the upper side limited by the concentrations at which micelle- or acid-soap formation starts. A kinetic scheme is proposed based on one active site in lipoxygenase-1 which alternately binds the two substrates.

Zoledronic acid (0.5 mg kg Long-term treatment with zoledronic acid reduced the number of jaw bone marrow cells, without affecting the number of long bone marrow cells. Zoledronic acid treatment did not affect the number of osteoclasts in vivo. Yet, the bisphosphonate increased bone volume and mineral density of both long bone and jaw. Interestingly, 6 months of treatment suppressed bone formation in the long bones without affecting the jaw. Unexpectedly, we showed that bisphosphonates can cause molar root resorption, mediated by active osteoclasts. Our findings provide more insight into bone-site-specific effects of bisphosphonates and into the aetiology of osteonecrosis of the jaw.

We investigated the effects of homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin B(6) on markers of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis and cerebral microangiopathy. Using 158 healthy siblings (mean age 46.0 +/- 7.6 years) of patients with premature atherosclerotic disease, we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial using 5 mg of folic acid plus 250 mg of vitamin B(6) daily (n = 78) or placebo medication (n = 80). Participants were followed for 2 years with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (carotid stenosis; carotid and/or vertebral elongation) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (white matter abnormalities; cerebral atrophy). Seventeen (10.8%) subjects refused MRA/MRI owing to claustrophobia and were excluded. From the remaining 141 participants, 68 received vitamin and 73 received placebo medication [42 (61.8%) and 48 (65.8%) had postmethionine hyperhomocysteinaemia, respectively]. Twenty-four participants (15.2%; 10 in the treatment and 14 in the placebo group) did not complete both years of the trial. Vitamin treatment was associated with an increase in plasma folate (13-fold vs. placebo; P < 0.001) and vitamin B(6) (8.8-fold; P < 0.001). Fasting and postmethionine total homocysteine concentrations decreased 38.7% (95% CI, 27.4-50.0) and 29.1% (95% CI, 19.2-39.0) vs. placebo (all P < 0.001). During follow up six individuals in the vitamin-treated and 11 in the placebo-treated group deteriorated in their outcome measurements. Vitamin treatment, as compared with placebo, was associated with nonsignificantly improved outcomes on both MRA and MRI outcome measurements (odds ratio 0.48; 95% CI 0.17-1.41; P = 0.18 and 0.48; CI 0.14-1.60; P = 0.23, respectively). These results could indicate a possible favourable effect of homocysteine-lowering treatment on cerebrovascular atherosclerosis and cerebral microangiopathy among healthy siblings of patients with premature atherosclerotic disease, but larger trials are required to establish this with certainty.},

The objective of this study is to evaluate different types of non-absorbable sutures used for closure of the defects regarding the incidence of SBO due to IH/adhesions, adhesion formation in general, or reopening of the defects. A single-center retrospective study was performed. Patients who underwent LRYGBP were divided in 3 groups: group A closure of the defects with monofilament Polypropylene suture (Prolene®), group B with braided polyester suture (Ethibond®), group C with barbed knotless Polybutester suture (V-Loc®). Descriptive statistics were performed regarding SBO due to IH/adhesions, adhesion formation, and reopening of closed defects. From 5145 patients, 224 patients underwent exploratory laparoscopy for suspicion of SBO. Mean time interval was 28.4 months. IH or intermittent IH was found in 1.94% in group A, 1.78% in group B, and 1.40% in group C. Obstruction due to adhesions was found in 0.70%, 0.36%, and 0.42% per group, respectively. Adhesions in general were observed in 1.47% in group A, 1.43% in group B, and 1.06% in group C. The incidence of reopening was higher in group A (2.24%) in comparison with group B (1.13%, P = 0.041) and group C (1.05%, P = 0.001). After descriptive analysis, these results can withhold no difference among the 3 non-absorbable sutures regarding incidence of SBO due to IH or SBO due to adhesions, yet tendency for higher reopening rates after closure with monofilament Polypropylene suture is observed.},

Also, the anteroposterior dimension of the brainstem was measured at the level of the pons in the authors' 6 patients and in 20 age-matched healthy control subjects. Furthermore, the MRIs were evaluated for associated congenital brain anomalies. The facial nerves were absent in all six patients despite residual function in some facial muscles. The authors confirmed brainstem hypoplasia but did not find tegmental calcifications. The anteroposterior dimension of the brainstem ranged between 17 and 25 mm vs 20 to 27 mm for controls. In three patients there were congenital abnormalities in the posterior fossa. The absent facial nerves on MRI and the unusual distribution of the facial weakness, which is characteristic of Möbius syndrome, suggests that other cranial nerves, possibly the trigeminal, hypoglossal, or glossopharyngeal nerve, aberrantly innervate some lower facial muscles. Radiologic findings support the notion that Möbius syndrome is part of a more complex congenital anomaly of the fossa posterior.},

  abstract = {Physician staffed Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (P-HEMS) care in the Netherlands has transitioned from predominantly trauma management to handling a variety of medical conditions. Relevant outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS research have not been previously defined. National consensus was sought to identify relevant long term patient outcome parameters, process outcome parameters and performance outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS care. This was a mixed methods Delphi consensus study. A list of potentially relevant outcome parameters was identified using a systematic literature review. These parameters were subsequently surveyed in a Delphi consensus study. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services physicians and relevant stakeholders were invited to participate in this Delphi survey, where they were allowed to suggest additional outcome parameters. Descriptive analysis was performed on all data sets. Forty-nine potential outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS care were surveyed. Of 71 invited participants, 53 (75%), 40 (56%), and 20 (28%) participated in the first, second, and third round of the Delphi study, respectively. Consensus was reached on 25 (51%) of 49 outcome parameters as being important. These consisted of seven long term patient related outcome parameters, four short term patient related outcome parameters, five process outcome parameters and nine performance outcome parameters. In conclusion, this study identified 25 outcome parameters relevant for Dutch physician staffed HEMS care. These parameters should be considered when designing future studies and should be routinely collected for each dispatch if possible.},

  abstract = {Focal areas of signal intensity (FASI) in the posterior fossa are common in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). These can be difficult to distinguish from tumour processes when they are atypical. This study aimed to describe the initial radiological features of atypical posterior fossa FASI, depending on the clinical and radiological evolution of the lesion. We conducted a multicentre retrospective study of NF1 children with atypical FASI in the posterior fossa. The lesions were classified according to their evolution over time: 'non-neoplastic FASI' if they regressed, or 'possible neoplastic FASI' if they remained stable or progressed. Forty-two lesions from 31 patients were analyzed. The mean follow-up period between the first and last MRI scans was 7.1 years. Twenty-one atypical FASI were classified as 'non-neoplastic FASI' and 21 as 'possible neoplastic FASI'. Younger age at diagnosis, pontine location, and blurred contours were more indicative of 'non-neoplastic FASI' on the initial MRI, whereas symptomatic, cystic or exophytic lesions, the presence of enhancement after gadolinium injection, sharp contours, and clear mass effect were more indicative of a 'possible neoplastic FASI'. Unexpectedly, abnormal initial spectroscopy and small mass effect could be found in 'non-neoplastic FASI', as could the presence of hypointensity on T1-weighted images. This study is important in specifying which posterior fossa hyperintensities on T2-weighted MRIs require specific clinical and radiological follow-up.},

  abstract = {Arctic amplification of climate change is causing sea ice to retreat at unprecedented rates, potentially opening up large vulnerable Arctic areas for oil and gas exploration and new shipping routes. This rapid warming marginalizes sympagic species habitats making them more sensitive to other anthropogenic pressures. Here, we assess potential impacts of hypothetic oil spills from the northernmost licensed oil field Wisting and additional neighbouring spill sites in areas currently not open to oil exploitation on the key ice-associated Arctic fish species polar cod (Boreogadus saida). We do this by developing and running combined data-driven models for the ocean, oil spill dispersal and fate, and the early life stages of polar cod. Sea ice and the Polar Front act as natural barriers limiting the exchange of polar cod eggs and larvae and oil spill between Atlantic and Polar Water. However, both barriers vary seasonally so that the sea ice retreats and the Polar Front weakens towards summer causing significant increases in oil exposure to early life stages of polar cod under varying oil spill scenarios investigated here. Previous literature emphasizes that fall feeding conditions must be sufficient for juvenile polar cod to allocate lipids and survive their first winter. Here, we show that less than half the exposed individuals experience these suitable feeding conditions in the fall. The seasonal exposure intensity suggests a need for petroleum regulations with temporal and spatial limitations varying through the year. However, even with these seasonal dynamic regulations in place, climate change induced by the use of fossil fuel will likely reduce these natural barriers through continued sea ice retreat and a weakening of the Polar Front thereby reducing their barrier effects. Risk assessments of anthropogenic impacts on key Arctic ecosystem components in the vicinity of the ice edge zone and the Polar Front will therefore have to be updated to account for these major changes.},

SARS-CoV-2 enzymes, namely main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro), play a pivotal role in the viral life cycle, making them a putative drug target. Here, we described for the first time the potential inhibitory activity of chicory extract against both proteases. Besides, we have identified that the four most abundant sesquiterpene lactones in chicory inhibited these proteases, showing an effective binding in the active sites of Mpro and PLpro.

These small molecules have shown several health benefits for various diseases, including brain disorders. However, it is unknown whether these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and which could be the effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. We show that six sesquiterpene lactones evaluated in an in vitro model of the BBB have different capacities to be transported through the barrier. Costunolide presented more than 20 % of transport while lactucin, 11β-13-dihydrolactucin, 11β-13-dihydrolactucopicrin, and parthenolide presented between 10 % and 20 %, whilst almost no transport was detected for lactucopicrin. Furthermore, costunolide and parthenolide reduced P-gp ABC transporter expression alongside an increase in caveolin-1, the main protein of caveolae. Remarkably, these two compounds improved barrier tightness by increasing the expression of both tight and adherens junctions. These findings open a new avenue to explore costunolide and parthenolide as promising compounds for brain therapies.},

Ensuring this requires on-site testing devices that are compatible with complex matrices such as primary production samples. Among all, faeces are considered the most challenging matrix type that makes it difficult to identify pathogens because of complexity in sample preparation for molecular testing. We have developed a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based veterinary point-of-care (POC) device (VETPOD) and adapted it to detect Salmonella enterica in primary production samples. Three different sampling methods (semi-wet chicken faeces, boot socks collection and dust samples from poultry shed) were iteratively tested to assess their nature of complexity and possibility for adapting them as suitable sampling methods for on-site testing. During the study, the sample preparation method that included a two-step centrifugation combined with washing of the enriched Salmonella cells was found crucial in eliminating amplification inhibitors originating from the faecal matrices. A total of 90 samples were tested that included 60 samples for sensitivity study and 30 samples for relative level of detection (RLOD, a level of detection in comparison to ISO 6579:1 reference method). Overall, the VETPOD had a sensitivity of 90%, 84.62% and 81.82% for boot sock, faecal and dust samples, respectively. The RLOD was 2.23 CFU/25 g which was found to be 1.33 times higher than the ISO 6579:1. Performing with an excellent agreement with ISO 6579:1, the VETPOD proved as a promising alternative to detect Salmonella spp. in primary production and animal husbandry samples.},

  abstract = {Increased total tau (t-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a key characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is considered to result from neurodegeneration. T-tau levels, however, can be increased in very early disease stages, when neurodegeneration is limited, and can be normal in advanced disease stages. This suggests that t-tau levels may be driven by other mechanisms as well. Because tau pathophysiology is emerging as treatment target for AD, we aimed to clarify molecular processes associated with CSF t-tau levels. We performed a proteomic, genomic, and imaging study in 1380 individuals with AD, in the preclinical, prodromal, and mild dementia stage, and 380 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and EMIF-AD Multimodality Biomarker Discovery study. We found that, relative to controls, AD individuals with increased t-tau had increased CSF concentrations of over 400 proteins enriched for neuronal plasticity processes. In contrast, AD individuals with normal t-tau had decreased levels of these plasticity proteins and showed increased concentrations of proteins indicative of blood-brain barrier and blood-CSF barrier dysfunction, relative to controls. The distinct proteomic profiles were already present in the preclinical AD stage and persisted in prodromal and dementia stages implying that they reflect disease traits rather than disease states. Dysregulated plasticity proteins were associated with SUZ12 and REST signaling, suggesting aberrant gene repression. GWAS analyses contrasting AD individuals with and without increased t-tau highlighted several genes involved in the regulation of gene expression. Targeted analyses of SNP rs9877502 in GMNC, associated with t-tau levels previously, correlated in individuals with AD with CSF concentrations of 591 plasticity associated proteins. The number of APOE-e4 alleles, however, was not associated with the concentration of plasticity related proteins. CSF t-tau levels in AD are associated with altered levels of proteins involved in neuronal plasticity and blood-brain and blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. Future trials may need to stratify on CSF t-tau status, as AD individuals with increased t-tau and normal t-tau are likely to respond differently to treatment, given their opposite CSF proteomic profiles.},

Patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia completed the QoR-15NL (preoperatively (t1) and twice postoperatively (t2 and t3)) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for general recovery at t2. A psychometric evaluation was performed to assess the QoR-15NL's validity, reliability, responsiveness, reproducibility and feasibility. Two hundred and eleven patients agreed to participate (recruitment rate 94%), and 165 patients were included (completion rate 78%). The QoR-15NL score correlated with the VAS for general recovery (rs = 0.59). Construct validity was further demonstrated by confirmation of expected negative associations between the QoR-15NL and duration of surgery (rs = -0.25), duration of Post Anesthesia Care Unit stay (rs = -0.31), and duration of hospital stay (rs = -0.27). The QoR-15NL score decreased significantly according to the extent of surgery. Cronbach's alpha was 0.87, split-half reliability was 0.8, and the test-retest intra-class coefficient was 0.93.

Here we report that S100A1 protein (0.1microM) interacts with the RyR2 in resting permeabilized cardiomyocytes at free Ca2+-levels comparable to diastolic Ca2+-concentrations ( approximately 150nM). Alterations of RyR2 function due to S100A1 binding was assessed via analysis of Ca2+-spark characteristics. Ca2+-spark frequency, amplitude and duration were all reduced upon perfusion with 0.1microM S100A1 protein by 38%, 14% and 18%, respectively. Most likely, these effects were conveyed through the S100A1 C-terminus (S100A1-ct; amino acids 75-94) as the corresponding S100A1-ct peptide (0.1microM) inhibited S100A1 protein binding to the RyR2 and similarly attenuated frequency, amplitude and duration of Ca2+-sparks by 52%, 8% and 26%, respectively. Accordingly, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-content was slightly increased but the stoichiometry of other accessory RyR2 modulators (sorcin/FKBP12.6) remained unaltered by S100A1. Hence, we propose S100A1 as a novel inhibitory modulator of RyR2 function at diastolic Ca2+-concentrations in rabbit ventricular cardiomyocytes.},

To assure a precise coordination of both temporally and spatially transduction of intracellular Ca(2+) oscillations to downstream signaling networks and target operations, Ca(2+) cycling regulation in muscle tissue is conducted by a plethora of diverse molecules. Ca(2+) S100A1 is a member of the Ca(2+)-binding S100 protein family and represents the most abundant S100 isoform in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Early studies revealed distinct expression patterns of S100A1 in healthy and diseased cardiac tissue from animal models and humans. Further elaborate investigations uncovered S100A1 protein as a basic requirement for striated muscle Ca(2+) handling integrity. S100A1 is a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte Ca(2+) cycling and contractile performance. S100A1-mediated inotropy unfolds independent and on top of beta AR-stimulated contractility with unchanged beta AR downstream signaling. S100A1 has further been detected at different sites within the cardiac sarcomere indicating potential roles in myofilament function. More recently, a study reported a mitochondrial location of S100A1 in cardiomyocytes. Additionally, normalizing the level of S100A1 protein by means of viral cardiac gene transfer in animal heart failure models resulted in a disrupted progression towards cardiac failure and enhanced survival. This brief review is confined to the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of S100A1 in cardiac and skeletal muscle Ca(2+) handling with a particular focus on its potential as a molecular target for future therapeutic interventions.},

Enhanced downstream cAMP signaling has been proposed as the underlying mechanism for increased β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) responsiveness. However, molecular targets mediating improved cardiac contractile performance by βARKct and its impact on G(βγ)-mediated signaling have yet to be fully elucidated. We sought to identify G(βγ)-regulated targets and signaling mechanisms conveying βARKct-mediated enhanced βAR responsiveness in normal (NC) and failing (FC) adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Assessing viral-based βARKct gene delivery with electrophysiological techniques, analysis of contractile performance, subcellular Ca²(+) handling, and site-specific protein phosphorylation, we demonstrate that βARKct enhances the cardiac L-type Ca²(+) channel (LCC) current (I(Ca)) both in NCs and FCs on βAR stimulation. Mechanistically, βARKct augments I(Ca) by preventing enhanced inhibitory interaction between the α1-LCC subunit (Cav1.2α) and liberated G(βγ) subunits downstream of activated βARs. Despite improved βAR contractile responsiveness, βARKct neither increased nor restored cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and calmodulin-dependent kinase II signaling including unchanged protein kinase (PK)Cε, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, Akt, ERK5, and p38 activation both in NCs and FCs. Accordingly, although βARKct significantly increases I(Ca) and Ca²(+) transients, being susceptible to suppression by recombinant G(βγ) protein and use-dependent LCC blocker, βARKct-expressing cardiomyocytes exhibit equal basal and βAR-stimulated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²(+) load, spontaneous diastolic Ca²(+) leakage, and survival rates and were less susceptible to field-stimulated Ca²(+) waves compared with controls. Our study identifies a G(βγ)-dependent signaling pathway attenuating cardiomyocyte I(Ca) on βAR as molecular target for the G(βγ)-sequestering peptide βARKct. Targeted interruption of this inhibitory signaling pathway by βARKct confers improved βAR contractile responsiveness through increased I(Ca) without enhancing regular or restoring abnormal cAMP-signaling. βARKct-mediated improvement of I(Ca) rendered cardiomyocytes neither susceptible to βAR-induced damage nor arrhythmogenic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²(+) leakage.},

Cardiomyocytes express ORAI1 but its role in heart function is also unknown. Using reverse genetics in zebrafish, we demonstrated that inactivation of the highly conserved zebrafish orthologue of ORAI1 resulted in severe heart failure, reduced ventricular systolic function, bradycardia and skeletal muscle weakness. Electron microscopy of Orai1-deficient myocytes revealed progressive skeletal muscle instability with loss of myofiber integrity and ultrastructural abnormalities of the z-disc in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. Isolated Orai1-deficient cardiomyocytes showed loss of the calcineurin-associated protein calsarcin from the z-discs. Furthermore, we found mechanosignal transduction was affected in Orai1-depleted hearts, indicating an essential role for ORAI1 in establishing the cardiac signaling transduction machinery at the z-disc. Our findings identify ORAI1 as an important regulator of cardiac and skeletal muscle function and provide evidence linking ORAI1-mediated calcium signaling to sarcomere integrity and cardiomyocyte function.},

Deregulation of mTOR signaling occurs during and contributes to the severity of myocardial damage from ischemic heart disease. However, the relative roles of mTORC1 versus mTORC2 in the pathogenesis of ischemic damage are unknown. Combined pharmacological and molecular approaches were used to alter the balance of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in cultured cardiac myocytes and in mouse hearts subjected to conditions that mimic ischemic heart disease. The importance of mTOR signaling in cardiac protection was demonstrated by pharmacological inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 with Torin1, which led to increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and tissue damage after myocardial infarction. Predominant mTORC1 signaling mediated by suppression of mTORC2 with Rictor similarly increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and tissue damage after myocardial infarction. In comparison, preferentially shifting toward mTORC2 signaling by inhibition of mTORC1 with PRAS40 led to decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and tissue damage after myocardial infarction. These results suggest that selectively increasing mTORC2 while concurrently inhibiting mTORC1 signaling is a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of ischemic heart disease.},

Among mTORC1 regulatory binding partners, the role of Proline Rich AKT Substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) in controlling mTORC1 activity and cellular growth in response to pathological and physiological stress in the heart has never been addressed. This report shows PRAS40 is regulated by AKT in cardiomyocytes and that AKT-driven phosphorylation relieves the inhibitory function of PRAS40. PRAS40 overexpression in vitro blocks mTORC1 in cardiomyocytes and decreases pathological growth. Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression in vivo blunts pathological remodeling after pressure overload and preserves cardiac function. Inhibition of mTORC1 by PRAS40 preferentially promotes protective mTORC2 signaling in chronic diseased myocardium. In contrast, strong PRAS40 phosphorylation by AKT allows for physiological hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo, whereas cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of a PRAS40 mutant lacking capacity for AKT-phosphorylation inhibits physiological growth in vivo, demonstrating that AKT-mediated PRAS40 phosphorylation is necessary for induction of physiological hypertrophy. Therefore, PRAS40 phosphorylation acts as a molecular switch allowing mTORC1 activation during physiological growth, opening up unique possibilities for therapeutic regulation of the mTORC1 complex to mitigate pathologic myocardial hypertrophy by PRAS40.},

Serial measurement was performed before and 30 min, 180 min, and 300 min after exercise. Healthy volunteers served as a control group. In 21 PAH patients, hsTnT levels were detectable before exercise with a close correlation between hsTnT and NT-proBNP. hsTnT was detectable in all PAH patients after exercise and significantly increased from 7.5 ng/L at baseline to 14.62 ng/L after 300 min, whereas levels of NT-proBNP remained constant with time. Using the novel hsTnT assay, the current study provides first evidence that hsTnT levels increase in PAH patients after maximal physical exercise, while levels of other biomarkers remain constant after exercise testing. This might provide new insights into pathophysiology and individual risk assessment in patients with PAH.},

In the liver, insulin resistance contributes to hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, which further worsens the metabolic profile. Defects in mTOR signalling are believed to contribute to metabolic dysfunctions in diabetic liver and hearts, but evidence is missing that mTOR activation is causal to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This study shows that specific mTORC1 inhibition by PRAS40 prevents the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This phenotype was associated with improved metabolic function, blunted hypertrophic growth and preserved cardiac function. In addition PRAS40 treatment improves hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduces systemic hyperglycaemia in obese mice. Thus, unlike rapamycin, mTORC1 inhibition with PRAS40 improves metabolic profile in diabetic mice. These findings may open novel avenues for therapeutic strategies using PRAS40 directed against diabetic-related diseases.},

However, in most in vitro settings that study neural physiology, cells are grown as monolayers on stiff surfaces that maximize adhesion and proliferation, and, therefore, they lack the physiological cues that ECM in native neuronal tissues provides. Macromolecular crowding (MMC) is a biophysical phenomenon based on the principle of excluded volume that can be harnessed to induce native ECM deposition by cells in culture. Here, we show that MMC using two species of Ficoll with vitamin C supplementation significantly boosts deposition of relevant brain ECM by cultured human astrocytes. Dopaminergic neurons cocultured on this astrocyte-ECM bed prepared under MMC treatment showed longer and denser neuronal extensions, a higher number of pre ad post synaptic contacts, and increased physiological activity, as evidenced by higher frequency calcium oscillation, compared to standard coculture conditions. When the pharmacological activity of various compounds was tested on MMC-treated cocultures, their responses were enhanced, and for apomorphine, a D2-receptor agonist, it was inverted in comparison to control cell culture conditions, thus emulating responses observed in in vivo settings. These results indicate that macromolecular crowding can harness the ECM-building potential of human astrocytes in vitro forming an ultra-flat 3D microenvironment that makes neural cultures more physiological and pharmacological relevant.},

Quantitative measurements with MP2RAGE showed very high reproducibility across sites and subjects, and errors were in concordance with previous results and other field strengths. QSM had high inter-site reproducibility for relevant subcortical volumes. CEST imaging revealed systematic differences between the sites, but reproducibility was comparable to results in the literature. Relaxometry had also very high agreement between sites, but due to the high sensitivity, differences caused by different applications of the B1 calibration of the two RF coil types used were observed.

Preventive Child Healthcare professionals assessed children's psychosocial functioning during routine health examinations. We assessed the scale structure (by means of Structural Equation Modelling), validity (correlation coefficients, sensitivity and specificity) and usability (ratings by parents and professionals) of each questionnaire and the degree to which they could improve the identification based only on clinical assessment (logistic regression). For the three questionnaires, Cronbach's alphas varied between 0.80 and 0.89. Sensitivities for a clinical CBCL at a cut off point with specificity = 0.90 varied between 0.78 and 0.86 for the three questionnaires. Areas under the Receiver Operating Curve, using the CBCL as criterion, varied between 0.93 and 0.96. No differences were statistically significant. All three questionnaires added information to the clinical assessment. Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for added information were PSC: 29.3 (14.4-59.8), SDQ: 55.0 (23.1-131.2) and PSYBOBA: 68.5 (28.3-165.6). Parents preferred the SDQ and PSYBOBA.

A validated inventory (state-trait operation anxiety-state) was used to assess perioperative state anxiety before (T1) and after (T2) surgery. In addition, trait operation anxiety was evaluated with an additional validated inventory (state-trait operation anxiety-trait). Moreover, user ratings on the usefulness of VORT were assessed with an evaluation questionnaire. Study arms were compared for perioperative state anxiety with two-tailed independent samples t tests. Subjective ratings were correlated with STOA-Trait values to investigate possible associations between perioperative anxiety with perceived usefulness. There were no significant differences in perioperative state anxiety between VORT and standard operation preparation procedures before and after the surgery. Nonetheless, patients' ratings of VORT overall were positive. The tour was perceived as useful and, therefore, showed acceptance for VR use. These ratings were unrelated to the degree of perioperative anxiety. The subjective benefit of VORT could not be explained by a reduction of perioperative anxiety. Instead, VORT appears to serve the need for information and reduce uncertainty. In addition, VORT is perceived as beneficial regardless of the age of the patients. Considering this effect and the manageable organizational and financial effort toward implementation, the general use of VORT can be recommended.

Experts on patient safety and medical education from 3 European countries were asked to suggest learning objectives concerning patient safety using group concept mapping. Following 3 successive steps, experts rated ideas by importance and difficulty to achieve. Correlation analyses investigated the relationship between those. Overarching topics of the learning goals (clusters) were identified with multivariate analysis. A total of 119 statements about intended learning objectives on patient safety were generated, of which 86 remained for sorting and rating. Based on multivariate analyses, 10 overarching topics (clusters) emerged. Both the learning objectives and the overarching topics showed high correspondence with the WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide. Strong correlations emerged between importance and difficulty ratings for learning objectives and overarching topics. The WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide's learning goals are still relevant and up-to-date. Remarkably, learning objectives categorized as highly important are also perceived as difficult to achieve. In summary, the insufficient implementation in medical curricula cannot be attributed to the content of the learning goals. The future focus should be on how the WHO learning goals can be implemented in existing curricular courses.},

Given the holistic nature of the spiral curriculum, we assumed that a purely digital model would have an impact on knowledge acquisition due to missing hands-on learning opportunities. The aim of the study was to investigate, using an emergency seminar as an example, whether purely digital training leads to a difference in theoretical knowledge compared to the traditional model. Study design: We used a two-groups design comparing a sample of medical students taught in 2020 with a purely digital teaching format (DF;  Students in the DF group scored significantly lower than students in the TF group in the final exams. Students in the DF group rated the course significantly worse than students in the TF group. The study results illustrate that purely digital education leads to inferior knowledge acquisition compared to the traditional spiral curriculum. A possible explanation may lie in a deeper processing of the information (e.g., understanding the information by experience and analysis) and accordingly a better memory recall. Moreover, the students' critical appraisal of the DF may have had an unfavorable effect on learning performance. Moderating factors may be lower learning motivation or the "zoom fatigue" effect. These study results clearly illustrate the importance of hands-on teaching for knowledge acquisition.

Morphometric measurements performed to determine the exact position of the supraorbital foramen relative to the surrounding landmarks showed different values in males and females. An accessory foramen was also observed on the examined skulls in 16.67% of cases. Detailed knowledge of anatomical variations of the supraorbital foramen is required for safe and successful administration of regional anesthesia, in order to avoid iatrogenic nerve injuries during orbitofacial region surgery.},

  abstract = {To help enhance the quality of integrated stroke care delivery, regional stroke services networks in the Netherlands participated in a self-assessment study in 2012, 2015 and 2019. Coordinators of the regional stroke services networks filled out an online self-assessment questionnaire in 2012, 2015 and 2019. The questionnaire, which was based on the Development Model for Integrated Care, consisted of 97 questions in nine clusters (themes). Cluster scores were calculated as proportions of the activities implemented. Associations between clusters and features of stroke services were assessed by regression analysis. The response rate varied from 93.1% (2012) to 85.5% (2019). Over the years, the regional stroke services networks increased in 'size': the median number of organisations involved and the volume of patients per network increased (7 and 499 in 2019, compared to 5 and 364 in 2012). At the same time, fewer coordinators were appointed for more than 1 day a week in 2019 (35.1%) compared to 2012 (45.9%). Between 2012 and 2019, there were statistically significantly more elements implemented in four out of nine clusters: 'Transparent entrepreneurship' (MD = 18.0% F(1) = 10.693, p = 0.001), 'Roles and tasks' (MD = 14.0% F(1) = 9.255, p = 0.003), 'Patient-centeredness' (MD = 12.9% F(1) = 9.255, p = 0.003), and 'Commitment' (MD = 11.2%, F(1) = 4.982, p = 0.028). A statistically significant positive correlation was found for all clusters between implementation of activities and age of the network. In addition, the number of involved organisations is associated with better execution of implemented activities for 'Transparent entrepreneurship', 'Result-focused learning' and 'Quality of care'. Conversely, there are small but negative associations between the volume of patients and implementation rates for 'Interprofessional teamwork' and 'Patient-centredness'. This long-term analyses of stroke service development in the Netherlands, showed that between 2012 and 2019, integrated care activities within the regional stroke networks increased. Experience in collaboration between organisations within a network benefits the uptake of integrated care activities.},

The Second World War prevented agreement being reached on a standard to quantify disability glare but the Stiles-Holladay formula was widely accepted as such. In 1983, CIE started a new effort to develop a CIE standard making use of research data published in the post-war years. A committee was formed that agreed that new data and insights justified an extension of the angular domain of a disability glare formula and allowed introduction of an age factor and allowance for ocular pigmentation. Three disability glare equations were formulated, each for an appropriately restricted angular domain. The most general, the CIE General Disability Glare equation, covers the full angular range between 0.1 degrees and 100 degrees but for optometrists the CIE Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay Disability Glare equation, with validity domain between one degree and 30 degrees, will often suffice. Disability glare is due to intraocular scatter and obeys, in the one-degree to 30-degree angular domain, albeit with great individual spread, the Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay equation: (L(veil) /E(glare))(Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay) = 10 (1 + [Age/70](4)).1/theta(2). Quantitative examples are given of the manifestation of disability glare, particularly in traffic.},

Experimental work, mainly on rabbits, was reviewed and complemented with the results of calculations on the thermal changes in the ocular media. Safe exposure limits were derived over the optical spectrum from the near ultraviolet to the far infrared. Lasers may be a cause of thermal cataract only in the near ultraviolet. Moreover, in this field of research too, it is concluded that science may be regarded as the present state of misunderstanding.},

In most cases the HCN guidelines produce results that hardly deviate from those obtained with the ACGIH guidelines but in some cases the results diverge and in other cases HCN gives an answer where ACGIH seems to fall short.

In visual science, the completely different and far better documented colour stereoscopic effect, known as chromostereopsis, prevails. A historical account is given of the development of ideas about this chromostereopsis, often by amusing trials and errors. The original explanation by Bruecke in terms of chromatic aberration (in present-day literature usually indicated as transverse chromatic aberration) and a temporal off-axis position of the fovea still forms the basis of present-day understanding, even though Bruecke rejected his own explanation. It had to be complemented by an additional off-axis effect of the pupil, not in an anatomical sense, as Einthoven presumed but failed to find but in a functional sense by a non-centric Stiles-Crawford effect. Although a comprehensive individual experimental proof is still missing, the evidence available indicates that a satisfactory quantitative explanation has been reached.},

Thirty patients undergoing major hepatic resection were included and randomized to receive a fluid bolus of 15 ml kg(-1) colloid (n=15) or crystalloid (n=15) solution over 30 min. SpHb was continuously measured on the index finger, and venous blood samples were analysed in both the steady-state phase (from induction until completion of parenchymal transection) and the dynamic phase (during fluid bolus). Correlation was significant between SpHb and Hb(satlab) (R(2)=0.50, n=543). The modified Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements showed a bias (precision) of -0.27 (1.06) and -0.02 (1.07) g dl(-1) for the steady-state and dynamic phases, respectively. SpHb accuracy increased when Hb(satlab) was <10 g dl(-1), with a bias (precision) of 0.41 (0.47) vs -0.26 (1.12) g dl(-1) for values >10 g dl(-1), but accuracy decreased after colloid administration (R(2)=0.25). SpHb correlated moderately with Hb(satlab) with a slight underestimation in both phases in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Accuracy increased for lower Hb(satlab) values but decreased in the presence of colloid solution. Further improvements are necessary to improve device accuracy under these conditions, so that SpHb might become a sensitive screening device for clinically significant anaemia.},

Furthermore, we assessed whether the PPV/SVV ratio, as a measure of dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn), could predict a reduction in norepinephrine requirement after fluid administration. Thirty patients received i.v. fluid (15 ml kg(-1) in 30 min) after hepatic resection and were considered responders when stroke volume index (SVI) increased ≥20% after fluid administration.

In responders, all dynamic variables, except PVI, decreased after fluid administration. Eadyn predicted a reduced norepinephrine requirement (AUC = 0.81). In patients undergoing major hepatic resection, both APW- and PW-based dynamic preload variables predict fluid responsiveness (preload) to a similar extent. Most variables (except PVI) also tracked fluid changes. Eadyn, as a measure of arterial elastance (afterload), might be helpful to distinguish the origin of hypotension.

In addition, optimal surgical conditions and safe and fast emergence are pivotal parts of anesthetic management. In high-antinociceptive propofol/remifentanil anesthesia with bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 60, norepinephrine was administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 80% of individual baseline. Fluid was administered if the ∆ plethysmographic waveform amplitude exceeded 10%. Surgical and recovery conditions, hemodynamic responses, and tissue oxygenation were investigated. Mean (SD) StO2 at the left thenar eminence increased from 83 (6)% before to 86 (4)% 20 min after induction of anesthesia (p <0.05).

Although numerous studies have demonstrated that indocyanine green elimination measurements in these patient populations can provide diagnostic or prognostic information to the clinician, 'hard' evidence - i.e. high-quality prospective randomised controlled trials - is lacking, and therefore it is not yet time to give a green light for use of indocyanine green in routine clinical practice.},

We explored the agreement of MAPcNIAP and MAPiNIAP with the gold standard: continuous invasive MAP measurement by placement of a radial artery catheter (MAPinvasive). In a total of 120 patients undergoing elective general surgery and clinically requiring MAPinvasive measurement, MAPiNIAP and MAPcNIAP were measured in a 30 min time period at an arbitrary moment during surgery with stable haemodynamics. MAPiNIAP was measured every 5 min. Data from 112 patients were analysed. Compared with MAPinvasive, modified Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias (sd) of 2 (9) mm Hg for MAPcNIAP and -2 (12) mm Hg for MAPiNIAP. Percentage errors for MAPcNIAP and MAPiNIAP were 22% and 32%, respectively. In a haemodynamically stable phase in patients undergoing general anaesthesia, the agreement with invasive MAP of continuous non-invasive measurement using a finger cuff was not inferior to the agreement of intermittent arm cuff oscillometry. Continuous measurements using a finger cuff can interchangeably be used as an alternative for intermittent arm cuff oscillometry in haemodynamically stable patients, with the advantage of beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring.

Few studies have examined the effectiveness of predicting FR according to the definition of FR, and assessment of inconclusive values of PPV and SVV around the cut-off value (the "grey zone") might improve individual FR prediction. We explored the ability of noninvasive volume clamp derived measurements of PPV and SVV to predict FR using the grey zone approach, and we assessed the influence of multiple thresholds on the predictive ability of the numerical definition of FR. Ninety patients undergoing general surgery were included in this prospective observational study and received a 500 mL fluid bolus as deemed clinically required by the attending anesthesiologist. A minimal relative increase in stroke volume index (↑SVI) was used to define FR with different thresholds from 10-25%. The PPV, SVV, and SVI were measured using the Nexfin® device that employs noninvasive volume clamp plethysmography. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve gradually increased for PPV / SVV with higher threshold values (from 0.818 / 0.760 at 10% ↑SVI to 0.928 / 0.944 at 25% ↑SVI). The grey zone limits of both PPV and SVV changed from 9-16% (PPV) and 5-13% (SVV) at the 10% ↑SVI threshold to 18-21% (PPV) and 14-16% (SVV) at the 25% ↑SVI threshold. Noninvasive PPV and SVV measurements allow an acceptable FR prediction, although the reliability of both variables is dependent on the intended increase in SVI, which improves substantially with concomitant smaller grey zones at higher ↑SVI thresholds.},

  abstract = {Hypovolaemia is generally believed to induce centralization of blood volume. Therefore, we evaluated whether induced hypo- and hypervolaemia result in changes in central blood volumes (pulmonary blood volume (PBV), intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV)) and we explored the effects on the distribution between these central blood volumes and circulating blood volume (Vd circ). Six anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing Foxhound dogs underwent random blood volume alterations in steps of 150 ml (mild) to 450 ml (moderate), either by haemorrhage, retransfusion of blood, or colloid infusion. PBV, ITBV and Vd circ were measured using (transpulmonary) dye dilution. The PBV/Vd circ ratio and the ITBV/Vd circ ratio were used as an assessment of blood volume distribution. 68 blood volume alterations resulted in changes in Vdcirc ranging from -33 to +31%. PBV and ITBV decreased during mild and moderate haemorrhage, while during retransfusion, PBV and ITBV increased during moderate hypervolaemia only. The PBV/Vd circ ratio remained constant during all stages of hypo- and hypervolaemia (mean values between 0.20-0.22). This was also true for the ITBV/Vd circ ratio, which remained between 0.31 and 0.32, except for moderate hypervolaemia, where it increased slightly to 0.33 (0.02), P<0.05. Mild to moderate blood volume alterations result in changes of Vd circ, PBV and ITBV. The ratio between the central blood volumes and Vd circ generally remained unaltered. Therefore, it could be suggested that in anaesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs, the cardiovascular system maintains the distribution of blood between central and circulating blood volume.},

  abstract = {Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) very commonly accompanies general anaesthesia in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. The development of IOH is unwanted, since it is associated with adverse outcomes such as acute kidney injury and myocardial injury, stroke and mortality. Although the definition of IOH is variable, harm starts to occur below a mean arterial pressure (MAP) threshold of 65 mmHg. The odds of adverse outcome increase for increasing duration and/or magnitude of IOH below this threshold, and even short periods of IOH seem to be associated with adverse outcomes. Therefore, reducing the hypotensive burden by predicting and preventing IOH through proactive appropriate treatment may potentially improve patient outcome. In this review article, we summarise the current state of the prediction of IOH by the use of so-called machine-learning algorithms. Machine-learning algorithms that use high-fidelity data from the arterial pressure waveform, may be used to reveal 'traits' that are unseen by the human eye and are associated with the later development of IOH. These algorithms can use large datasets for 'training', and can subsequently be used by clinicians for haemodynamic monitoring and guiding therapy. A first clinically available application, the hypotension prediction index (HPI), is aimed to predict an impending hypotensive event, and additionally, to guide appropriate treatment by calculated secondary variables to asses preload (dynamic preload variables), contractility (dP/dt},

The new Oxygen Reserve Index (ORi), a relative indicator of the partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood (PaO2) in the range of 100-200 mm Hg, may allow additional monitoring of oxygen status. In this prospective validation intervention study, 20 healthy volunteers were breathing standardized oxygen concentrations ranging from mild hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.14) to hyperoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 1.0) via a tight-fitting face mask. ORi was measured noninvasively by multiwavelength pulse co-oximetry using 2 finger sensors. These ORi values (unitless scale, 0.00-1.00) were compared with measured PaO2 values. Repeated-measurements correlation analysis was performed to assess the ORi/PaO2 relationship. ORi trending ability was assessed using a 4-quadrant plot. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to assess the prediction of hypoxia (low-ranged PaO2, <100 mm Hg). Within the ORi-sensitive range, a strong positive correlation was found between ORi and PaO2 for both sensors (R = 0.78 and 0.83; P < .0001). ORi trending of PaO2 was good within this range (concordance rate = 94%). The prediction of PaO2 <100 mm Hg was also good, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.91 and 99% sensitivity and 82% specificity. In this prospective volunteer validation study, a strong and positive correlation between PaO2 and ORi was found, together with a good trending ability. Based on these data, the future use of ORi as a continuous noninvasive monitoring tool for assessing oxygenation status in patients receiving supplemental oxygen might be supported.},

The majority of these papers investigated the use of either cerebral or peripheral tissue oxygen saturation, derived non-invasively using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In some of these studies, the microcirculation was "provocated" by inducing short-term tissue hypoxia, allowing the assessment of functional microvascular reserve. Additionally, studies on technical differences between NIRS monitors are summarized, as well as studies investigating the feasibility of NIRS monitoring, mainly in the pediatric patient population. Last but not least, novel monitoring tools allow assessing oxygenation at a (sub)cellular level, and those papers incorporating these techniques are also reviewed here.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research to reveal the localization of a broad scale of compounds ranging from metabolites to proteins in diseased tissues, such as malignant tumors. MSI is most commonly used for the two-dimensional imaging of tissues from multiple patients or for the three-dimensional (3D) imaging of tissue from a single patient. These applications are potentially introducing a sampling bias on a sample or patient level, respectively. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the consequences of sampling bias on sample representativeness and on the precision of biomarker discovery for histological grading of human bladder cancers by MSI. We therefore submitted formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 14 bladder cancer patients with varying histological grades to 3D analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI. We found that, after removing 20% of the data based on novel outlier detection routines for 3D-MSI data based on the evaluation of digestion efficacy and z-directed regression, on average 33% of a sample has to be measured in order to obtain sufficient coverage of the existing biological variance within a tissue sample. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, 3D MALDI-MSI is applied for the first time on a cohort of bladder cancer patients using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue of bladder cancer resections. This work portrays the reproducibility that can be achieved when employing an optimized sample preparation and subsequent data evaluation approach. Our data shows the influence of sampling bias on the variability of the results, especially for a small patient cohort. Furthermore, the presented data analysis workflow can be used by others as a 3D FFPE data-analysis pipeline working on multi-patient 3D-MSI studies.},

A temporal spatial analysis of Utstein data was performed for all adult patients with a non-traumatic OHCA attended by three emergency medical services (EMS) covering the north of the Netherlands during a one-year period. Patients were considered potentially eligible for ECPR if they had a witnessed arrest with immediate bystander CPR, an initial shockable rhythm (or signs of life during resuscitation) and could be presented in an ECPR-centre within 45 minutes of the arrest. Endpoint of interest was defined as the hypothetical number of ECPR eligible patients after 10, 15 and 20 minutes of conventional CPR and upon (hypothetical) arrival in an ECPR-centre as a fraction of the total number of OHCA patients attended by EMS. During the study period 622 OHCA patients were attended, of which 200 (32%) met ECPR eligibility criteria upon EMS arrival. The optimal transition point between conventional CPR and ECPR was found to be after 15 minutes. Hypothetical intra-arrest transport of all patients in whom no return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained after that point (n = 84) would have yielded 16/622 (2.5%) patients being potentially ECPR eligible upon hospital arrival (average low-flow time 52 minutes), whereas on-scene initiation of ECPR would have resulted in 84/622 (13.5%) potential candidates (average estimated low-flow time 24 minutes before cannulation). Even in healthcare systems with relatively short transport distances to hospital, consideration should be given to pre-hospital initiation of ECPR for OHCA as it shortens low-flow time and increases the number of potentially eligible patients.},

Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ITP of both tests were comparable: 82.9 and 40.9% for the PA-IgG(RIA) and 90.2 and 36.7% for the PIFT. A significant positive correlation was observed between the mean amount of PA-IgG measured and the height of PIFT scores with anti-IgG. Of 38 discrepancies between PA-IgG(RIA) and PIFT with anti-IgG, 15 were due to borderline results, 17 were associated with abnormal platelet-size distribution and 20 were associated with occurrence of IgM antibodies. These results suggest influences of platelet fragments and/or aggregates on accurate measurement of PA-IgG. Both fragments and aggregates escape from accurate platelet counting, while their contribution to the total IgG content remains. Therefore, a falsely elevated PA-IgG (RIA) may be measured.},

  abstract = {Several variables that may affect accurate measurement of platelet-associated IgG (PA-IgG) were studied using a radioimmunoassay of the consumption type. The amount of PA-IgG of washed, unfixed normal donor platelets was 1.0 +/- 0.9 fg IgG/platelet (mean +/- 2 SD). Upon storage of washed platelets in a buffer containing EDTA, the amount decreased significantly to 0.2 +/- 0.2 fg IgG/platelet. Simultaneously, an increase in modal platelet volume was observed. Similar results were obtained when platelets were fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA). We postulate that this decrease in PA-IgG is caused by the release of plasma IgG entrapped by the surface-connected canicular system of the platelet, when the platelets swell during storage in EDTA or fixation with PFA. This presence of varying amounts of entrapped plasma IgG may cause the wide discrepancies in PA-IgG found in normal donor platelets as well as platelets from ITP patients by other investigators. A good quantification of platelet-bound alloantibodies was possible with our assay when platelets were routinely fixed to diminish the amount of nonspecific PA-IgG. This was demonstrated with different anti-Zwa (= anti-PlA1), anti-Baka and anti-HLA sera. We also observed that fragments of platelets as well as fragments of cells of other types can cause aspecifically increased Pa-IgG values and can thus interfere with the proper measurement of platelet-bound antibodies in all kinds of immunoassays in general.},

Microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, have been shown to play a role in the development of radiation-induced neurotoxicity. However, their molecular and hence functional response to proton irradiation remains unknown. This study investigates the effect of protons on microglia by comparing the effect of photons and protons as well as the influence of age and different irradiated volumes. Rats were irradiated with 14 Gy to the whole brain with photons (X-rays), plateau protons, spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) protons or to 50 % anterior, or 50 % posterior brain sub-volumes with plateau protons. RNA sequencing, validation of microglial priming gene expression using qPCR and high-content imaging analysis of microglial morphology were performed in the cortex at 12 weeks post irradiation. Photons and plateau protons induced a shared transcriptomic response associated with neuroinflammation. This response was associated with a similar microglial priming gene expression signature and distribution of microglial morphologies. Expression of the priming gene signature was less pronounced in juvenile rats compared to adults and slightly increased in rats irradiated with SOBP protons. High-precision partial brain irradiation with protons induced a local microglial priming response and morphological changes. Overall, our data indicate that the brain responds in a similar manner to photons and plateau protons with a shared local upregulation of microglial priming-associated genes, potentially enhancing the immune response to subsequent inflammatory challenges.},

Overall and disease-specific survival graphs are shown in Kaplan-Maier projections and compared with expected survival outcomes for males in the same age categories from the Dutch provinces of North Holland and Flevoland. Statistical evaluation was based on Cox regression analysis. During the prevalence screening, 1014 patients were diagnosed with pCA. Median follow up was 55 mo, 126 (12.4%) patients died, 20 (2.0%) of pCA. Overall 5-yr observed and expected disease-specific survival was 97.7% and 82%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, a Gleason sum of 4+4 or higher (p=0.025) was predictive of pCA death. The observed survival data are in line with the literature and the expected favorable outcome for a screened population. The proportion of men dying from pCA is still small, and a 10-yr follow-up period for the final evaluation of the ERSPC may be too short.},

While DHOPE resuscitates the mitochondria and increases hepatic adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, NMP enables hepatobiliary viability assessment prior to transplantation. In contrast to DHOPE, NMP requires a perfusion solution with an oxygen carrier, for which red blood cells (RBC) have been used in most series. RBC, however, have limitations and cannot be used cold. We, therefore, established a protocol of sequential DHOPE, controlled oxygenated rewarming (COR), and NMP using a new hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC)-based perfusion fluid (DHOPE-COR-NMP trial, NTR5972). Seven livers from donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors, which were initially declined for transplantation nationwide, underwent DHOPE-COR-NMP. Livers were considered transplantable if perfusate pH and lactate normalized, bile production was ≥10 mL and biliary pH > 7.45 within 150 minutes of NMP. Based on these criteria five livers were transplanted. The primary endpoint, 3-month graft survival, was a 100%. In conclusion, sequential DHOPE-COR-NMP using an HBOC-based perfusion fluid offers a novel method of liver machine perfusion for combined resuscitation and viability testing of suboptimal livers prior to transplantation.},

Midazolam is often used as a preoperative sedative in advance of a propofol-based anesthetic. In this study, we identified the influence of midazolam on the pharmacokinetics of propofol. Eight healthy male volunteers were studied on two occasions in a random crossover manner. During Session A, volunteers received propofol 1 mg/kg in 1 min followed by an infusion of 2.5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 59 min. During Session B, in addition to this propofol infusion scheme, a target-controlled infusion of midazolam (constant C(t): 125 ng/mL) was given from 15 min before the start until 6 h after termination of the propofol infusion. Arterial blood samples for blood propofol and plasma midazolam concentration analysis were taken until 6 h after termination of the propofol infusion. Nonlinear mixed-effects models examining the influence of midazolam and hemodynamic variables on propofol pharmacokinetics were constructed using Akaike criterion for model selection. In the presence of midazolam (C(blood): 224.8 +/- 41.6 ng/mL), the blood propofol concentration increased by 25.1% +/- 13.3% compared with when propofol was given as single drug. Midazolam (C(blood): 225 ng/mL) reduced propofol Cl(1) from 1.94 to 1.61 L/min, Cl(2) from 2.86 to 1.52 L/min, and Cl(3) from 0.95 to 0.73 L/min. Inclusion of mean arterial blood pressure further improved the propofol pharmacokinetic model. Midazolam reduces the metabolic and rapid and slow distribution clearances of propofol. In addition, a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure is associated with propofol pharmacokinetic alterations that increase the blood propofol concentration.},

The toxicity of ALPI increased from a 48 h LC50 of 18 mg L(-1) to a 21 day LC50 value of 3.2 mg L(-1), resulting in an acute-to-chronic ratio of 5.6. This may imply a change in classification from low to moderate toxicity. ALPI also affected sublethal life cycle parameters, with an EC50 of 2.8 mg L(-1) for cumulative reproductive output and of 3.4 mg L(-1) for population growth rate, revealing a nonspecific mode of action. DOPO showed only sublethal effects with an EC50 value of 48 mg L(-1) for cumulative reproductive output and an EC50 value of 73 mg L(-1) for population growth rate. The toxicity of DOPO to D. magna was classified as low and likely occurred above environmentally relevant concentrations, but we identified specific effects on reproduction. Given the low chronic toxicity of DOPO and the moderate toxicity of ALPI, based on this study only, DOPO seems to be more suitable than ALPI for BFR replacement in polymers.},

In 49 lesions, from 10 MS patients, MT ratio (MTR), T1 relaxation time, signal intensity (SI) on T1-weighted SE images normalized to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and SI normalized to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured. Differences in contrast of hypointense lesions were measured between single slice and multislice imaging. MTR correlated significantly (p < .001) with longitudinal relaxation rates (1/T1) (r = 0.84), SI normalized to NAWM (r = 0.78), and SI normalized to CSF (r = 0.75). The degree of reduction in contrast, caused by multislice imaging, correlated significantly with MTR of lesions (r = 0.60, p < .001), leading to reduction of hypointense lesion load (p < .01). We conclude that all four MR markers for severe tissue destruction are highly correlated when applied to selected hypointense lesions on T1-weighted SE images. Due to "incidental" off-resonance excitation, contrast and hypointense lesion load will be reduced in multislice T1-weighted SE images.},

A total of 80 patients with LLD from the prospective naturalistic follow-up Mood Disorders in Elderly treated with Electroconvulsive Therapy study were examined. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired before ECT. Overall brain morphology (white and grey matter) was evaluated using visual rating scales. Cognitive functioning before, during, and after ECT was measured using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). A linear mixed-model analysis was performed to analyze the association between structural brain alterations and cognitive functioning over time.

Transient cognitive impairment was not associated with medial temporal or global cortical atrophy (MTA, GCA). All patients showed a significant drop in cognitive functioning during ECT, which however recovered above baseline levels post-ECT and remained stable until at least 6 months post-ECT, independently of severity of WMH, GCA, or MTA. Therefore, clinicians should not be reluctant to start or continue ECT in patients with severe structural brain alterations.},

  abstract = {To determine whether magnetic resonance (MR) can give additional information in prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies, when the ultrasound (US) analysis is not conclusive. Ultrafast MR scanning examined 39 pregnant women with 41 fetuses in whom US was suspicious of fetal congenital abnormalities. Two techniques were used namely (1) HASTE inversion recovery sequence and (2) FISP 2D. Thirty-nine patients with 41 fetuses were referred for MR because of an equivocal US with regard to brain, spine, skeletal and miscellaneous anomalies. In 1 twin pregnancy, 1 co-twin has not been examined with MRI because of its demise. In 22 of them, additional information was obtained by MR. In 9 the MR was confirmative with the US examination. Four were false negative, comparing with the postnatal diagnosis. Three failed because of maternal claustrophobia and in 2 a diagnosis could not be made. From the 40 fetuses in this study, 38 were examined postnatally by MR, US, plain X-ray or autopsy was performed to confirm the prenatal diagnosis. The use of MRI in obstetrics has been limited, until recently. With fast MRI sequences it is not necessary to sedate the fetus. It is advisable in cases where US is equivocal concerning congenital anomalies of the fetus to use MR with fast or ultrafast scan technique, especially when the central nervous system is concerned.},

  abstract = {Cortical oscillations and scale-free neural activity are thought to influence a variety of cognitive functions, but their differential relationships to neural stability and flexibility has never been investigated. Based on the existing literature, we hypothesize that scale-free and oscillatory processes in the brain exhibit different trade-offs between stability and flexibility; specifically, cortical oscillations may reflect variable, task-responsive aspects of brain activity, while scale-free activity is proposed to reflect a more stable and task-unresponsive aspect. We test this hypothesis using data from two large-scale MEG studies (HCP: n = 89; CamCAN: n = 195), operationalizing stability and flexibility by task-responsiveness and spontaneous intra-subject variability in resting state. We demonstrate that the power-law exponent of scale-free activity is a highly stable parameter, which responds little to external cognitive demands and shows minimal spontaneous fluctuations over time. In contrast, oscillatory power, particularly in the alpha range (8-13 Hz), responds strongly to tasks and exhibits comparatively large spontaneous fluctuations over time. In sum, our data support differential roles for oscillatory and scale-free activity in the brain with respect to neural stability and flexibility. This result carries implications for criticality-based theories of scale-free activity, state-trait models of variability, and homeostatic views of the brain with regulated variables vs. effectors.},

Early diagnosis, however, is challenging due to non-specific symptoms and delays in obtaining key investigation results. Empiric treatment with intravenous (IV) aciclovir in cases of suspected meningitis to cover for possible concurrent viral encephalitis is an approach not supported by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) ( https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng240 , 2024). Such practice exposes patients to the risk of iatrogenic nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Our objectives were to evaluate the diagnostic approach to suspected viral encephalitis and appropriateness of aciclovir prescription. This was a retrospective cohort study of 410 patients over 16 years old prescribed IV aciclovir for suspected central nervous system infection at Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust between December 2021 and February 2024. 29% of patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for possible or probable encephalitis while 5% did not fulfil any of the criteria. 38% had no microbiological or serological testing for HSV or varicella zoster virus. Discharge diagnoses included 5% with viral encephalitis (2% confirmed on cerebrospinal fluid testing) and 6% with meningitis, while the commonest diagnosis was delirium (11% of patients). While acknowledging clinical uncertainty and attendant risks of missing a diagnosis of true viral encephalitis, in line with NICE guidelines we suggest a review of routine prescription of IV aciclovir in suspected meningitis and emphasise the importance of altered mental status as a useful distinguishing feature between viral encephalitis and meningitis in immunocompetent patients.},

We evaluated the relation between MRI findings and disability in a quantitative follow-up study of 48 MS patients. Median duration of follow-up was 24 months (range, 10 to 42 months). Computer-assisted volume measurements employing a seed-growing technique yielded a standard error of measurement of 0.275 cm2. The median total area of the hyperintense lesions on the initial T2-weighted images was 8.4 cm2. The median increase was 0.76 cm2/yr (9%). In a subgroup (n = 19) with short-TR/short-TE spin-echo (SE) images, we measured the hypointense lesion load. The median total area of the lesions at entry was 0.70 cm2, with a median increase of 0.28 cm2/yr (40%). The total area of the hyperintense lesions on the initial T2-weighted images showed a weak correlation with the Expanded Disability Status Scale score at entry (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [SRCC] = 0.30; 0.02 < p < 0.05). The increase in disability showed a positive correlation (SRCC = 0.19) with the increase in hyperintense lesion load on the T2-weighted SE images, but this correlation did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09), probably because of lack of clinical progression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The patients had already been classified according to recent consensus definitions regarding the clinical course of MS into relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP) or primary progressive (PP). Significant (p < 0.01; Spearman test) differences were present between RR and SP patients regarding total lesion load, size and location of lesions. RR and PP patients showed similar MR patterns. PP and SP patients differed in total lesion load, small and medium-sized lesions. The degree of atrophy was highest for SP patients. The clinical progression rate [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)/disease duration] was similar for various subgroups; the MR progression rate (total lesion score/disease duration) was significantly larger for SP than for PP patients. The lesions load disability quotient (total lesion load/EDSS) differed between RR and PP patients and also between SP and PP patients. In SP patients, the total lesion load correlated significantly (Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.52) with EDSS. We conclude that PP patients differ in MR abnormalities from SP patients, that PP and RR patients have similar MR abnormalities and that RR and SP patients are at a different end of the same spectrum of the disease. As the dynamics and clinical impact of MS lesions are different in the various clinical subgroups, they should be considered separately in clinical trials.},

The degree of hypointensity was scored semiquantitatively by two blinded observers in reference to normal-appearing white matter. Signal intensities of the lesions and the normal-appearing white matter were measured to obtain contrast ratios. Hematoxylin-eosin stain was used to assess degree of matrix destruction (decrease of density of the neuropil) and cellularity of a lesion, Klüver-Barrera stain for degree of demyelination, Bodian stain for axonal density, and immunostaining of glial fibrillary acid protein for reactive astrocytes and fibrillary gliosis. Nineteen lesions were selected for analysis. Nearly all lesions were compatible with the chronic MS plaque: hypocellularity, absence of myelinated axons, in the presence of reactive astrocytes. Contrast ratios of the lesions were highly correlated (R = -0.90; p < 0.01), with degree of hypointensity scored semiquantitatively. Degree of hypointensity on T1-weighted SE images did not correlate with degree of demyelination or number of reactive astrocytes, but was associated with axonal density (R = -0.71; p = 0.001). A trend was found with degree of matrix destruction (R = 0.45; p = 0.052). We conclude that, in our limited sample, hypointense lesions seen on T1-weighted SE MR images are associated histopathologically with severe tissue destruction, including axonal loss. Our results need to be substantiated in a larger study on more varied patient material to evaluate the use of hypointense lesions as a surrogate marker of persistent deficit in MS patients.},

Initially, comparison of 10 different lures showed that a10X load of OFM pheromone, codlemone, terpinyl acetate, and acetic acid were key components of the most attractive lures (TRE11034 and 1123). Subsequent trapping studies in mating disruption and non-disrupted orchards in the United States and Spain compared trap captures with TRE1123 and OFM L2 lures. Compared to the OFM L2 lure, the TRE1123 lure captured more moths in mating disruption and non-disrupted orchards, caught female moths, improved the precision of mean population estimates, and led to greater resolution of generational flights. Suppression of trap captures in mating disruption versus non-disrupted orchards was similar with both lures. There were significant linear correlations between weekly trap captures with the two lures in the majority of mating disruption and non-disrupted orchards across locations and years. Furthermore, regression of the slopes of trap capture regressions (i.e., attractiveness of enhanced lures relative to sex pheromone lures alone) versus moth density (as measured by mean cumulative moth capture with TRE1123 and OFM L2 lures) exhibited a significant positive relationship in non-disrupted orchards, indicating enhanced lures were relatively more attractive under high population densities. This relationship was not significant in mating disruption orchards, likely due to the density independent, non-competitive mechanism of mating disruption for oriental fruit moth when using high-dose reservoir dispensers.},

HCV-specific antibodies (anti-HCV Ab) in blood specimens were tested for HCV seropositive by the third-generation HCV ELISA system. The subjects, later identified as 152 seropositive and 88 seronegative, were selected for analysis of the correlates of HCV infection. They were interviewed to explore a variety of possible risk factors for HCV infection with a structured questionnaire. The results showed that the anti-HCV age-adjusted seroprevalence was 55.8%. Needle injection was significant to the increased anti-HCV seroprevalence, with multivariate age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of 1.9 and 1.2-3.9 respectively. This study identifies Ma-Sha-Gou as an endemic area of HCV infection, in which needle injection from any medical activity was a possible transmission pathway in the village, and suggests the health authorities/community health nurses should give the residents a comprehensive community-based education program to interrupt HCV transmission.},

Each of these patterns has traditionally been associated with distinct DNA methylation pathways with CHH methylation being controlled by the RNA dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway employing small RNAs as a guide for the de novo DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE (DRM2), and maintenance DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) being responsible for faithful propagation of CG methylation. Here we report an unusual 'dense methylation' pattern under the control of MET1, with methylation in all three sequence contexts. We identified epi-alleles of dense methylation at a non coding RNA locus (At4g15242) in Arabidopsis ecotypes, with distinct dense methylation and expression characteristics, which are stably maintained and transmitted in genetic crosses and which can be heritably altered by depletion of MET1. This suggests that, in addition to its classical CG maintenance function, at certain loci MET1 plays a role in creating transcriptional diversity based on the generation of independent epi-alleles. Database inspection identified several other loci with MET1-dependent dense methylation patterns. Arabidopsis ecotypes contain distinct epi-alleles of these loci with expression patterns that inversely correlate with methylation density, predominantly within the transcribed region. In Arabidopsis, dense methylation appears to be an exception as it is only found at a small number of loci. Its presence does, however, highlight the potential for MET1 as a contributor to epigenetic diversity, and it will be interesting to investigate the representation of dense methylation in other plant species.},

We investigated a barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutant with reduced epicuticular leaf waxes on which spores of adapted and nonadapted powdery mildew fungi showed reduced germination. The barley gene responsible for the mutant wax phenotype was cloned in a forward genetic screen and identified to encode a 3-KETOACYL-CoA SYNTHASE (HvKCS6), a protein participating in fatty acid elongation and required for synthesis of epicuticular waxes. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the mutant has significantly fewer aliphatic wax constituents with a chain length above C-24. Complementation of the mutant restored wild-type wax and overcame germination penalty, indicating that wax constituents less present on the mutant are a crucial clue for spore germination. Investigation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transgenic plants with sense silencing of Arabidopsis REQUIRED FOR CUTICULAR WAX PRODUCTION1, the HvKCS6 ortholog, revealed the same germination phenotype against adapted and nonadapted powdery mildew fungi. Our findings hint to an evolutionary conserved mechanism for sensing of plant surfaces among distantly related powdery mildews that is based on KCS6-derived wax components. Perception of such a signal must have been evolved before the monocot-dicot split took place approximately 150 million years ago.},

  abstract = {Critically ill cirrhotic patients are increasingly transplanted, but there is no consensus about futile liver transplantation (LT). Therefore, the decision to delay or deny LT is often extensively debated. These debates arise from different opinions of futility among transplant team members. This study aims to achieve a multinational and multidisciplinary consensus on the definition of futility in LT and to develop well-articulated criteria for not proceeding with LT due to futility. Thirty-five international experts from anesthesiology/intensive care, hepatology, and transplant surgery were surveyed using the Delphi method. More than 70% of similar answers to a question were necessary to define agreement. The panel recommended patient and graft survival at 1 year after LT to define futility. Severe frailty and persistent fever or <72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy in case of ongoing sepsis were considered reasons to delay LT. A simple assessment of the number of organs failing was considered the most appropriate way to decide whether LT should be delayed or denied, with respiratory, circulatory and metabolic failures having the most influence in this decision. The thresholds of severity of organ failures contraindicating LT for which a consensus was achieved were a Pao2/FiO2 ratio<150 mm Hg, a norepinephrine dose >1 μg/kg per minute and a serum lactate level >9 mmol/L. Our expert panel provides a consensus on the definition of futile LT and on specific criteria for postponing or denying LT. A framework that may facilitate the decision if a patient is too sick for transplant is presented.},

We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data and renal biopsies obtained from patients with severe renal impairment (overt proteinuria, progressive deterioration of renal function) after LT with respect to safety, etiology of renal disease, and therapeutic consequences. Renal biopsies were obtained from 14 patients at median (minimum-maximum) 3 (0.2-12) years after LT. No major complications associated with renal biopsy were observed. Histomorphological alterations were varied (nephrosclerosis, n = 5; IgA-glomerulonephritis, n = 4; tenofovir-associated nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type 1, membranous glomerulonephritis, amyloid A amyloidosis, and calcineurin inhibitor nephropathy, n = 1, respectively). The diagnosis of specific renal diseases other than calcineurin-inhibitor nephrotoxicity facilitated specific treaments and avoided unnecessary modification of immunosuppression in the majority of patients. Renal biopsy in patients with CKD after LT seems safe and may offer specific therapeutic options. Furthermore, unnecessary changes of immunosuppression can be avoided in a considerable number of patients.},

Cows (n = 250) were randomly allocated to the hoof trimming group, with the remainder assigned to the non-trim cohort. One trained professional hoof trimmer used the five-step Dutch method to trim the hind feet of the trimming group.

We evaluated antibody yield, quality and N-glycosylation. All six antibodies had comparable levels of expression between 3.5 and 9% of total soluble protein content and were shown to have neutralizing activity in a cell-based assay. However, IgA1κ-based Adalimumab and Ustekinumab were poorly secreted compared to their IgG counterparts. Infliximab was poorly secreted regardless of isotype backbone. This corresponded with the observation that both IgA1κ- and IgG1κ-based Infliximab were enriched in oligomannose-type N-glycan structures. For IgG1κ-based Ustekinumab and Adalimumab, the major N-glycan type was the typical plant complex N-glycan, biantennary with terminal N-acetylglucosamine, β1,2-xylose and core α1,3-fucose. In contrast, the major N-glycan on the IgA-based antibodies was xylosylated, but lacked core α1,3-fucose and one terminal N-acetylglucosamine. This type of N-glycan occurs usually in marginal percentages in plants and was never shown to be the main fraction of a plant-produced recombinant protein. Our data demonstrate that the antibody isotype may have a profound influence on the type of N-glycan an antibody receives.},

Inclusion criteria were: dementia diagnosis, long-term care institutions, NPS, and longitudinal design. The literature search revealed 1982 papers of which 18 met the inclusion criteria. The patients were predominately female and aged 75 years and over. The follow-up period ranged from three months to one year. The number of assessments ranged from two to five, and 12 different assessment instruments were used to study NPS. Aberrant motor behavior, depression, anxiety, and euphoria showed decline over time, and psychosis remained constant whereas apathy, agitation, irritability, and disinhibition increased over time. All symptoms showed specific intermittent courses. The methodological quality of the literature was limited by the small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and lack of comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessment instruments. In the reviewed studies, NPS in institutionalized residents with dementia showed a heterogeneous course, although methodological limitations and the diversity of the studies call for caution in interpretation. Future research should focus on large prospective cohort studies with institutionalized residents with dementia, examining a wide range of NPS.},

The passive pulmonary perfusion after surgical exclusion of the right ventricle has significant implications for the postoperative hemodynamic management of these patients. Because conventional pulmonary artery thermodilution catheters present methodologic problems in patients after TCPA, important cardiovascular variables such as cardiac index (CI) and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance indices (PVRI, SVRI) usually cannot be assessed directly. In a preliminary series of six patients undergoing TCPA (age 6-22 years), the applicability of a transpulmonary double indicator dilution technique for postoperative determinations of CI, PVRI, SVRI, and extravascular lung water (EVLW) was investigated. After central venous injection of ice-cold indocyanine green (5 mg), thermal and dye dilution curves were recorded in the abdominal aorta using a combined 4F fiberoptic thermistor catheter. Qualitative assessment of the tracer curves did not show major differences in measurements in patients with pulsatile perfusion of the lungs. CI, SVRI, and EVLW could be determined by use of standard algorithms. Pulmonary perfusion pressure for the calculation of PVRI was based on the gradient between central venous and left atrial pressure. The quality of indicator dilution curves allowed determination of flow-related variables in 33 of a total of 34 sets of measurements. No catheter-related problems occurred during or after the period of investigation. Postoperative EVLW was within the range that is commonly accepted as normal for adults. Mean PVRI initially decreased during the postoperative course but showed a significant increase after extubation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Thermodilution measurements of cardiac output (CO) by means of Swan-Ganz catheters, in a strict sense, represent pulmonary arterial blood flow (PBF). In principle, this is also true in the presence of intracardiac left-to-right shunts due to atrial or ventricular septal defects. However, early recirculation of indicator may give rise to serious methodological problems in these cases. We sought to determine the influence of intracardiac left-to-right shunts on different devices for thermodilution measurements of CO using an extra-corporeal flow model. METHODS. Blood flow was regulated by means of a centrifugal pump that at the same time enabled complete mixing of the indicator after injection (Fig. 1). Pulmonary and systemic parts of the circulation were simulated using two membrane oxygenators and a systemic-venous reservoir to delay systemic recirculation of indicator. Control measurements of PBF (Qp) and systemic (Qs) blood flow were performed by calibrated electromagnetic flow-meters (EMF). Blood temperature was kept constant using a heat exchanger without altering the indicator mass balance in the pulmonary circulation. Left-to-right shunt was varied at different systemic flow levels applying a Qp:Qs ratio ranging from 1:1 to 2.5:1. Thermodilution measurements of PBF were performed using two different thermodilution catheters that were connected to commercially available CO computers. Additionally, thermodilution curves were recorded on a microcomputer and analysed with custom-made software that enabled iterative regression analyses of the initial decay to determine that part of the downslope that best fits a mono-exponentially declining function. Extrapolation of the thermodilution curve was then based on the respective curve segment in order to eliminate indicator recirculation due to shunt flow. RESULTS. At moderate left-to-right shunts (Qp:Qs < 2:1) all thermodilution measurements showed close agreement with control measurements. At higher shunt flows (Qp:Qs > or = 2:1), however, conventional extrapolation procedures of CO computers considerably underestimated PBF (Fig. 2). This was particularly true when a slow-response thermistor catheter was used (Fig. 3). The reason for this underestimation of Qp was an overestimation of the area under curve because of inadequate mathematical elimination of indicator recirculation by standard truncation methods (Fig. 4). However, curve-alert messages of the commercially implemented software did not occur. A high level of agreement could be consistently obtained using a fast-response thermistor together with individual definition of extrapolation limits according to logarithmic regression analyses. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION. Under varying levels of left-to-right shunt, both the response time of thermodilution catheters and the algorithms for calculation of flow considerably influenced the validity of thermodilution measurements of PBF in an extracorporeal flow model. The use of computer-based regression analyses to define the optimal segment for monoexponential extrapolation could effectively eliminate indicator recirculation from the initial portion of the declining thermodilution curve and showed the closest agreement with EMF measurements of Qp. The quality of thermodilution curves with respect to recirculation peaks in the flow model was slightly better than in clinical routine. Nevertheless, the clinical applicability of the modified extrapolation algorithm could be illustrated during pulmonary thermodilution measurements in an exemplary patient with a ventricular septal defect (Fig. 5). PBF at extremely high shunt ratios, however, cannot be assessed by monoexponential extrapolation in principle (Fig. 6). Insufficient elimination of indicator recirculation resulted in flow values that closely resembled systemic rather than PBF. This finding is in accordance with a mathematical analysis of the underlying Steward-Hamilton equation if an infinite number of recirculations would be},

The infants underwent repeated standardised motor assessments and developmental tests. MRI was repeated at the corrected age of 12 months. Pronounced periventricular signal intensity changes on neonatal MRI and periventricular echodensities (flaring) on ultrasound were associated with a high incidence of transient motor problems during infancy. The degree of echogenicity carried the highest predictive value, as compared to duration of flaring on ultrasound and degree of periventricular signal intensity change on MRI. It is concluded that signal intensity changes on neonatal MRI represent the same ischaemic change of the periventricular white matter as flaring on ultrasound and that routine neonatal MRI screening is not warranted in premature infants without clinical evidence of neurological problems and with normal or mildly abnormal ultrasound scans.

  abstract = {The most common cause of endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in neonates (congenital hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia; CHH) are different monogenic form of gene mutations. About 50% of the mutations are known. We present a new mutation within the short-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH) gene causing CHH in two related patients. The course of two consanguineous patients with CHH are presented with a follow-up of >30 years. NextSeq 500 sequencing was performed and confined on known genes with autosomal recessive inheritance, namely ABCC8 (MANE Select: NM_00352.6), HADH (MANE Select: NM_005327.7) and KCNJ11 (MANE Select: NM_00525.4). Acylcarnitine-profiles were measured and 68Ga-DOTA Exendin PET/CT was performed. CHH was diagnosed in both patients in the neonatal period. A therapy with Diazoxid was initiated, which initially stabilized the disease in both children. With advancing age more hypoglycemic events occurred with an increase in carbohydrate intake leading to obesity in both patients. In addition to Diazoxide Somatostatin analogues were successfully added in adulthood. A genetic analysis documented a new homozygote mutation in the HADH gene (HADH-variant c.796G>T). Acyl-Carnitine profile showed an increased plasma Butyryl-carnitine, consistent with a dysfunction of the HADH enzyme. 68Gallium-DOTA-exendin showed an increased uptake in the whole pancreas in both patients. Clinical presentation, biochemical work-up and therapeutical response to Diazoxide and somatostatin analogues are consistent with previous reports of HADH-mutations. The overexpression of GLP-1 receptors in this context warrants further research.},

Such an approach creates a risk that extra-curricular activities become overloaded, and that teaching staff are distracted by continuous innovations. Within the health promotion sector there are thus increasing calls for an integrative approach to health-related behaviors. However, a meaningful integrative approach to different lifestyles will be possible only if there is some clustering of individual health-related behaviors and if health-related behaviors have a minimum number of determinants in common. This systematic review aims to identify to what extent the four health-related behaviors smoking, alcohol abuse, safe sex and healthy nutrition cluster; and how their determinants are associated. Potentially modifiable determinants that offer clues for an integrative approach of school health-promotion programs are identified. Besides, the direction in which health educators should look for a more efficient instructional design is indicated.},

Differences between the free and GDP-bound structures of IF2-G2 suggest that domain reorganization within the G2-G3-C1 regions underlies the different structural requirements of IF2 during the initiation process. However, these structural signals are unlikely forwarded from IF2-G2 to the C-terminal fMet-tRNA binding domain (IF2-C2) because the connected IF2-C1 and IF2-C2 modules show completely independent mobility, indicating that the bacterial interdomain connector lacks the rigidity that was found in the archaeal IF2 homolog aIF5B.},

Recognition of altered DNA, including bulky adducts, pyrimidine dimers and interstrand crosslinks (ICL), partially depends on proteins containing helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) domains. To understand how ICL is specifically recognized by the Fanconi anemia proteins FANCM and FAAP24, we determined the structure of the HhH domain of FAAP24. Although it resembles other HhH domains, the FAAP24 domain contains a canonical hairpin motif followed by distorted motif. The HhH domain can bind various DNA substrates; using nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiments, we demonstrate that the canonical HhH motif is required for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding, whereas the unstructured N-terminus can interact with single-stranded DNA. Both DNA binding surfaces are used for binding to ICL-like single/double-strand junction-containing DNA substrates. A structural model for FAAP24 bound to dsDNA has been made based on homology with the translesion polymerase iota. Site-directed mutagenesis, sequence conservation and charge distribution support the dsDNA-binding model. Analogous to other HhH domain-containing proteins, we suggest that multiple FAAP24 regions together contribute to binding to single/double-strand junction, which could contribute to specificity in ICL DNA recognition.},

The aim of this study was to investigate in a prospective observational multicenter study the first-year effects of CHT on BMD in transgender persons. A total of 231 transwomen and 199 transmen were included who completed the first year of CHT. Transwomen were treated with cyproterone acetate and oral or transdermal estradiol; transmen received transdermal or intramuscular testosterone. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed to measure lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH), and femoral neck (FN) BMD before and after 1 year of CHT. In transwomen, an increase in LS (+3.67%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.20 to 4.13%, p < 0.001), TH (+0.97%, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.31%, p < 0.001), and FN (+1.86%, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.31%, p < 0.001) BMD was found. In transmen, TH BMD increased after 1 year of CHT (+1.04%, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.44%, p < 0.001). No changes were observed in FN BMD (-0.46%, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.16%, p = 0.144). The increase in LS BMD was larger in transmen aged ≥50 years (+4.32%, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.36%, p = 0.001) compared with transmen aged <50 years (+0.68%, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.17%, p = 0.007). In conclusion, BMD increased in transgender persons after 1 year of CHT. In transmen of postmenopausal age, the LS BMD increased more than in younger transmen, which may lead to the hypothesis that the increase in BMD in transmen is the result of the aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, the number of people referred to gender identity clinics has rapidly increased. This raises several questions, especially concerning the frequency of performing gender-affirming treatments with irreversible effects and regret from such interventions. To study the current prevalence of gender dysphoria, how frequently gender-affirming treatments are performed, and the number of people experiencing regret of this treatment. The medical files of all people who attended our gender identity clinic from 1972 to 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. The number of (and change in) people who applied for transgender health care, the percentage of people starting with gender-affirming hormonal treatment (HT), the estimated prevalence of transgender people receiving gender-affirming treatment, the percentage of people who underwent gonadectomy, and the percentage of people who regretted gonadectomy, specified separately for each year. 6,793 people (4,432 birth-assigned male, 2,361 birth-assigned female) visited our gender identity clinic from 1972 through 2015. The number of people assessed per year increased 20-fold from 34 in 1980 to 686 in 2015. The estimated prevalence in the Netherlands in 2015 was 1:3,800 for men (transwomen) and 1:5,200 for women (transmen). The percentage of people who started HT within 5 years after the 1st visit decreased over time, with almost 90% in 1980 to 65% in 2010. The percentage of people who underwent gonadectomy within 5 years after starting HT remained stable over time (74.7% of transwomen and 83.8% of transmen). Only 0.6% of transwomen and 0.3% of transmen who underwent gonadectomy were identified as experiencing regret. Because the transgender population is growing, a larger availability of transgender health care is needed. Other health care providers should familiarize themselves with transgender health care, because HT can influence diseases and interact with medication. Because not all people apply for the classic treatment approach, special attention should be given to those who choose less common forms of treatment. This study was performed in the largest Dutch gender identity clinic, which treats more than 95% of the transgender population in the Netherlands. Because of the retrospective design, some data could be missing. The number of people with gender identity issues seeking professional help increased dramatically in recent decades. The percentage of people who regretted gonadectomy remained small and did not show a tendency to increase. Wiepjes CM, Nota NM, de Blok CJM, et al.

A retrospective analysis was done of the records of all consecutive patients (N = 147) with rectal carcinoma Dukes' Stage B or C who have received postoperative local radiotherapy in our institution in the years 1981 through 1989. All patients have been treated on a limited target area covered by only local radiation fields. Locoregional fields covering the whole iliac node chains have not been given. In our treatment protocol doses per fraction were from 2.25 to 2.50 Gy and total doses from 50 to 55 Gy. The minimum follow-up was 24 months; eight patients have been lost to follow-up. The overall 5-year survival rate for the whole group of patients was 39%. The actuarial 2- and 5-year pelvic recurrence rates were 14% and 22% respectively for Dukes' B patients and 30% and 38% respectively for Dukes' C patients. The difference between the pelvic recurrence rates of Stage B and Stage C patients was statistically significant (p = 0.009). No other factors with prognostic significance for pelvic recurrence were found. The interval between surgery and radiotherapy especially had no influence on pelvic recurrence rates. The 35 pelvic recurrences were classified as follows: 17 in-field, 5 marginal, 1 out-of-field, and 9 peritoneal seeding; in three patients there was not enough information for classification. Of the 32 classified pelvic recurrences, the five marginal recurrences were probably geographical misses, only the one out-of-field recurrences, the five marginal recurrences were probably geographical misses; only the one out-of-field recurrence might have been prevented with locoregional radiotherapy. Serious complications caused by the radiotherapy have occurred in 3% of the patients. We conclude that the results of postoperative local radiotherapy alone are comparable with the published results of locoregional radiation. Even when relatively high doses per fraction are given low complication rates are seen.},

Our analysis showed over 300 high-quality interactions, uncovering a large fraction of new E2-E3 pairs. Both within the E2 and the E3 cohorts, several members were identified that are more versatile in their interaction behaviour than others. We also found that the physical interactions of our screen compare well with reported functional E2-E3 pairs in in vitro ubiquitination experiments. For validation we confirmed the interaction of several versatile E2s with E3s in in vitro protein interaction assays and we used mutagenesis to alter the E3 interactions of the E2 specific for K63 linkages, UBE2N(Ubc13), towards the K48-specific UBE2D2(UbcH5B).

We investigated the potential of photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect the presence of a spontaneous pulse during automated CPR in an animal study. Twelve anesthetized pigs were instrumented to monitor circulatory and respiratory parameters. Here we present the simultaneously recorded PPG and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, followed by 20 min of automated CPR and subsequent defibrillation. After defibrillation, pediatric-guidelines-style life support was given in cycles of 2 min. PPG and ABP waveforms were recorded during all stages of the protocol. Raw PPG waveforms were acquired with a custom-built photoplethysmograph controlling a commercial reflectance pulse oximetry probe attached to the nose. ABP was measured in the aorta. In nine animals ROSC was achieved. Throughout the protocol, PPG and ABP frequency content showed strong resemblance. We demonstrate that (1) the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse during ventilation pauses, and that (2) frequency analysis of the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse and the determination of the pulse rate, even during ongoing chest compressions, if the pulse and compression rates are sufficiently distinct. These results demonstrate the potential of PPG as a non-invasive means to detect pulse presence or absence, as well as pulse rate during CPR.},

  abstract = {Endovascular thrombectomy (ET), combined with intravenous thrombolysis if possible, is an effective treatment option for patients with stroke who have confirmed anterior large vessel occlusion (aLVO). However, ET is mainly limited to comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs), resulting in a lack of ET capacity in remote, sparsely populated areas. Most stroke networks use the "Drip and Ship" or "Mothership" strategy, resulting in either delayed ET or intravenous thrombolysis, respectively. This study protocol introduces the Leitstellen-Basierte Erkennung von Schlaganfall-Patienten für eine Thrombektomie und daraufhin abgestimmte Optimierung der Rettungskette (LESTOR) strategy, developed to optimize the preclinical part of the stroke chain of survival to improve the clinical outcome of patients with suspected aLVO stroke. This involves refining the dispatch strategy for identifying patients with acute aLVO stroke using a phone-based aLVO query. This includes dispatching emergency physicians and emergency medical services (EMS) to urban emergency sites, as well as dispatching helicopter EMS to remote areas. If a highly suspected aLVO is identified after a standardized aLVO score evaluation during a structured examination at the emergency scene, prompt transport to a CSC should be prioritized. The LESTOR study is a controlled, nonrandomized study implementing the LESTOR strategy, with a stepped-wedge, cluster trial design in 6 districts in southwest Germany. In an interprofessional, iterative approach, an aLVO query or dispatch protocol intended for use by dispatchers, followed by a coordinated aLVO examination score for use by EMS, is being developed, evaluated, and pretested in a simulation study. After the training of all participating health care professionals with the corresponding final aLVO query, the LESTOR strategy is being implemented stepwise. Patients otherwise receive usual stroke care in both the control and intervention groups. The primary outcome is the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days in patients with stroke receiving endovascular treatment. We will use a generalized linear mixed model for data analysis. This study is accompanied by a cost-effectiveness analysis and a qualitative process evaluation. This paper describes and discusses the protocol for this controlled, nonrandomized LESTOR study. Enrollment was completed in June 2023. Data analysis is ongoing and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2024. The project started in April 2020 and will end in February 2024. We expect that the intervention will improve the clinical outcome of patients with aLVO stroke, especially outside the catchment areas of CSCs. The results of the accompanying process evaluation and the cost-effectiveness analysis will provide further insights into the implementation process and allow for a better interpretation of the results.

No differences in lens transmission larger than 4% were found. The mean value of lens autofluorescence corrected for normal age-dependency was found to correlate with the metabolic control: an increase of mean HbAlc by 1% resulted in an extra increase of autofluorescence by 11% (P = 0.002).

A large ongoing outbreak of Q-fever has been reported in the Netherlands. We studied various markers of infection in inpatients (hospitalised) and outpatients (treated by a general physician) with acute Q-fever in relation to disease severity. Leukocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations were measured in 25 inpatients and 40 outpatients upon presentation with acute Q-fever. Chest X-rays, if available, were analysed and confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure-age 65 (CURB-65) scores, indicating severity of pneumonia, were calculated. CRP was the only marker that significantly differentiated between inpatients and outpatients. It was increased in all patients from both groups. Leukocyte counts and PCT concentrations did not differ between inpatients and outpatients. Overall, only 13/65 patients had an increased leukocyte count and only 11/65 patients presented with PCT concentrations indicative of possible bacterial respiratory tract infection. Infiltrative changes on the chest X-ray were observed in the majority of patients. CURB-65 score was 0+/-1 (mean+/-SD). Acute Q-fever, a relatively mild pneumonia with low CURB-65 scores, specifically induces a response in CRP, while PCT concentrations and leukocytes are within the normal range or increased only marginally.},

To determine the feasibility, reproducibility and validity of the Shuttle Test (ST) to measure exercise capacity in people with stroke. Longitudinal study design. Rehabilitation department, day care centres from a nursing home and private practices specialized in neuro rehabilitation. People with subacute or chronic stroke. A standardized protocol was used to determine feasibility, reproducibility and validity of the 10-meter Shuttle Test (10mST). Number of shuttles completed, 1stVentilatory Threshold (1stVT). The associations of the number of shuttles completed and cardiopulmonary capacity as measured with a portable gas analyser were r > 0.7, confirming good convergent validity in subacute and chronic people with stroke. Criterion validity, however, indicates it is not a valid test for measuring maximal cardiopulmonary capacity (VO2max). Only 60% of participants were able to reach the 1stVT. Higher cardiopulmonary capacity and a higher total score of the lower extremity Motricity Index contributed significantly to a higher number of shuttles walked (p = 0.001). The Shuttle Test may be a safe and useful exercise test for people after stroke, but may not be appropriate for use with people who walk slower than 2 km/h or 0.56 m/s.},

  abstract = {Face-to-face communication is multimodal; it encompasses spoken words, facial expressions, gaze, and co-speech gestures. In contrast to linguistic symbols (e.g., spoken words or signs in sign language) relying on mostly explicit conventions, gestures vary in their degree of conventionality. Bodily signs may have a general accepted or conventionalized meaning (e.g., a head shake) or less so (e.g., self-grooming). We hypothesized that subjective perception of conventionality in co-speech gestures relies on the classical language network, i.e., the left hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Broca's area) and the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG, Wernicke's area) and studied 36 subjects watching video-recorded story retellings during a behavioral and an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. It is well documented that neural correlates of such naturalistic videos emerge as intersubject covariance (ISC) in fMRI even without involving a stimulus (model-free analysis). The subjects attended either to perceived conventionality or to a control condition (any hand movements or gesture-speech relations). Such tasks modulate ISC in contributing neural structures and thus we studied ISC changes to task demands in language networks. Indeed, the conventionality task significantly increased covariance of the button press time series and neuronal synchronization in the left IFG over the comparison with other tasks. In the left IFG, synchronous activity was observed during the conventionality task only. In contrast, the left pSTG exhibited correlated activation patterns during all conditions with an increase in the conventionality task at the trend level only. Conceivably, the left IFG can be considered a core region for the processing of perceived conventionality in co-speech gestures similar to spoken language. In general, the interpretation of conventionalized signs may rely on neural mechanisms that engage during language comprehension.},

Altered transmission of the central nervous serotonin (5-HT) contributes to dysfunctions in the cognitive control of emotions. To date, studies relating to pharmaco-fMRI challenging of the 5-HT system have focused on emotion processing for facial expressions. We investigated effects of a single-dose selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) on emotion regulation during virtual violence. For this purpose, 38 male participants played a violent video game during fMRI scanning. The SSRI reduced neural responses to violent actions in right-hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex encompassing the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but not to non-violent actions. Within the ACC, the drug effect differentiated areas with high inhibitory 5-HT1A receptor density (subgenual s25) from those with a lower density (pregenual p32, p24). This finding links functional responses during virtual violent actions with 5-HT neurotransmission in emotion regulation networks, underpinning the ecological validity of the 5-HT model in aggressive behavior. Available 5-HT receptor density data suggest that this SSRI effect is only observable when inhibitory and excitatory 5-HT receptors are balanced. The observed early functional changes may impact patient groups receiving SSRI treatment.},

  abstract = {Social interactions arise from patterns of communicative signs, whose perception and interpretation require a multitude of cognitive functions. The semiotic framework of Peirce's Universal Categories (UCs) laid ground for a novel cognitive-semiotic typology of social interactions. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 16 volunteers watched a movie narrative encompassing verbal and non-verbal social interactions. Three types of non-verbal interactions were coded ("unresolved," "non-habitual," and "habitual") based on a typology reflecting Peirce's UCs. As expected, the auditory cortex responded to verbal interactions, but non-verbal interactions modulated temporal areas as well. Conceivably, when speech was lacking, ambiguous visual information (unresolved interactions) primed auditory processing in contrast to learned behavioral patterns (habitual interactions). The latter recruited a parahippocampal-occipital network supporting conceptual processing and associative memory retrieval. Requesting semiotic contextualization, non-habitual interactions activated visuo-spatial and contextual rule-learning areas such as the temporo-parietal junction and right lateral prefrontal cortex. In summary, the cognitive-semiotic typology reflected distinct sensory and association networks underlying the interpretation of observed non-verbal social interactions.},

The reported incidence of phantom limb pain after trauma, injury or peripheral vascular diseases is 60% to 80%. Over half the patients with phantom pain have stump pain as well. Phantom pain can also occur in other parts of the body; it has been described after mastectomies and enucleation of the eye. Most patients with phantom pain have intermittent pain, with intervals that range from 1 day to several weeks. Even intervals of over a year have been reported. The pain often presents itself in the form of attacks that vary in duration from a few seconds to minutes or hours. In most cases, the pain is experienced distally in the missing limb, in places with the most extensive innervation density and cortical representation. Although there are still many questions as to the underlying mechanisms, peripheral as well as central neuronal mechanisms seem to be involved. Conservative therapy consists of drug treatment with amitriptyline, tramadol, carbamazepine, ketamine, or morphine. Based on the available evidence some effect may be expected from drug treatment. When conservative treatment fails, pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the stump neuroma or of the spinal ganglion (DRG) or spinal cord stimulation could be considered (evidence score 0). These treatments should only be applied in a study design.},

Adipogenic differentiation of adipose-tissue-derived MSC (adMSC) is important in various pathological processes. Adipocytes and their progenitors are metabolically active and secrete molecules (adipokines) that have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. Cell culturing in 2D is commonly used to study cellular responses, but the 2D environment does not reflect the structural situation for most cell types. Therefore, 3D culture systems have been developed to create an environment considered more physiological. Since knowledge about the effects of 3D cultivation on adipogenic differentiation is limited, we investigated its effects on adipogenic differentiation and adipokine release of adMSC (up to 28 days) and compared these with the effects in 2D. We demonstrated that cultivation conditions are crucial for cell behavior: in both 2D and 3D culture, adipogenic differentiation occurred only after specific stimulation. While the size and structure of adipogenically stimulated 3D spheroids remained stable during the experiment, the unstimulated spheroids showed signs of disintegration. Adipokine release was dependent on culture dimensionality; we found upregulated adiponectin and downregulated pro-inflammatory factors. Our findings are relevant for cell therapeutic applications of adMSC in complex, three-dimensionally arranged tissues.},

We demonstrated that the selected 3D model allowed the rapid and reliable formation of spheroids that were stable over several weeks and both accelerated and enhanced osteogenic differentiation compared with the 2D culture. Thus, our experiments provide new insights into the effects of cell arrangement of MSC in 2D and 3D. However, due to the different culture dimensions, various detection methods had to be chosen, which in principle limits the explanatory power of the comparison between 2D and 3D cultures.},

With rising life expectancy, a longer disease duration in PD patients is observed, further increasing the need and socioeconomic importance of adequate PD treatment. Today, PD is exclusively treated symptomatically, mainly by dopaminergic stimulation, while efforts to modify disease progression could not yet be translated to the clinics. New formulations of approved drugs and treatment options of motor fluctuations in advanced stages accompanied by telehealth monitoring have improved PD patients care. In addition, continuous improvement in the understanding of PD disease mechanisms resulted in the identification of new pharmacological targets. Applying novel trial designs, targeting of pre-symptomatic disease stages, and the acknowledgment of PD heterogeneity raise hopes to overcome past failures in the development of drugs for disease modification. In this review, we address these recent developments and venture a glimpse into the future of PD therapy in the years to come.},

Brain imaging studies using EEG/MEG and fMRI show altered amplitude and, more recently, decrease in phase coherence in response to external stimuli. What are the dynamic mechanisms of such phase incoherence, and can it serve as a differential-diagnostic marker? Addressing this gap in our knowledge, we uniquely combine a review of previous findings, novel empirical data, and computational-dynamic simulation. The main findings are: (i) the review shows decreased phase coherence in SCZ across a variety of different tasks and frequencies, e.g., task- and frequency-unspecific, which is further supported by our own novel data; (ii) our own data demonstrate diagnostic specificity of decreased phase coherence for SCZ as distinguished from major depressive disorder; (iii) simulation data exhibit increased phase offset in SCZ leading to a precision index, in the millisecond range, of the phase coherence relative to the timing of the external stimulus. Together, we demonstrate the key role of temporal imprecision in phase coherence of SCZ, including its mechanisms (phase offsets, precision index) on the basis of which we propose a phase-based temporal imprecision model of psychosis (PTP). The PTP targets a deeper dynamic layer of a basic disturbance. This converges well with other models of psychosis like the basic self-disturbance and time-space experience changes, as discussed in phenomenological and spatiotemporal psychopathology, as well as with the models of aberrant predictive coding and disconnection as in computational psychiatry. Finally, our results show that temporal imprecision as manifest in decreased phase coherence is a promising candidate biomarker for clinical differential diagnosis of SCZ, and more broadly, psychosis.},

Limited work describes the seasonality of BSIs or the differences in rates and anatomic locations of BSIs in collegiate runners. To describe seasonally related trends in anatomic locations of BSIs in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I male and female middle- and long-distance runners. Descriptive epidemiological study. Data from a 7-year prospective study of 2 NCAA Division I cross-country and track and field programs characterized BSIs over the years 2013 to 2020. Femoral neck, pelvic, sacral, lumbar spine, and calcaneal BSIs were considered trabecular-rich. All remaining BSIs were classified as cortical-rich. Total athlete-years of follow-up were calculated by subtracting the number of days an athlete was unable to run from the number of total study participation days. Annual incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of BSIs by the total athlete-years of follow-up for that year, and monthly incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of BSIs in a given month by the total athlete-years of follow-up for that month. Participants included 221 collegiate distance runners (114 female, 107 male). There were 154 BSIs across 482 total athlete-years, resulting in an incidence rate of 32 BSIs per 100 athlete-years. The female BSI rate was more than double that of the male BSI rate: 45 versus 20 BSIs per 100 athlete-years, respectively. The highest monthly BSI rates occurred during competitive months, with the lowest monthly BSI rates occurring during noncompetitive months.

He had a complicated medical history including atrial fibrillation (AF), recently status post a Watchman procedure, oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) revealed the presence of an intracardiac right atrial thrombus. Computed tomography (CT) angiography confirmed the presence of multiple pulmonary emboli (PE), and extension of the thrombus into the inferior vena cava. Pulmonary emboli are a common complication of thrombus in the right atrium. Management may include anticoagulation, thrombolysis, or thrombectomy. This case highlights that emergency physicians can expedite the diagnosis of intracardiac thrombus by using POCUS. The case presented describes a medically complex patient presenting with symptomatic right intracardiac and inferior vena caval thrombosis complicated by multiple PE. Point-of care ultrasound of the heart and lungs were included in his initial assessment, revealing findings of an intracardiac thrombus, and ruling out multiple other differential diagnoses including pericardial tamponade, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax.

We also examined the utility of muscle activation pattern analysis for predicting the result of postural responses. 20 PD patients and 21 age-matched controls were subjected to repeated pull-test trials and a gait task. Kinematics and neuromuscular synergies were extracted from accelerometer- and surface-EMG-data. Pull-test trials were automatically classified based on their outcome (self-recovered and failed-balance-recovery trials). Muscle activity during pull-tests was sustained by four neuromuscular synergies to which distinct physiological functions could be ascribed in healthy controls. In PD patients these were retained but their temporal recruitment was altered. This deviation was similar for self-recovered and failed-balance-recovery trials, although more pronounced in the latter. The significance of these findings was supported by correlations to clinical data and successful outcome-prediction. The impairment of postural control in PD may result from an abnormal temporal recruitment of postural neuromuscular synergies. The study provides further insight into the pathophysiology of impaired balance in PD. The ability to classify postural responses through the analysis of neuromuscular synergies may inform the design of fall detection and prevention devices.},

Using Signal Detection Theory (SDT), we operationalize the cognitive bias by the Criterion C as distinguished from the sensitivity index d'. This was probed in a self-task based on morphed self- and other faces. Behavioral data demonstrate clear cognitive bias, i.e., Criterion C. That was related to the EEG-based INT as measured by the autocorrelation window (ACW) in especially the transmodal regions dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and default-mode network (DMN) as distinct from unimodal visual cortex. Finally, simulation of the same paradigm in a large-scale network model shows high degrees of temporal integration of temporally distinct inputs in CMS/DMN and dlPFC while temporal segregation predominates in visual cortex. Together, we demonstrate a key role of INT-based temporal integration in CMS/DMN and dlPFC including its relation to the brain's uni-transmodal topographical organization in mediating the cognitive bias of our self.},

However, the networks interconnecting these genes show substantial overlap, highlighting common mechanisms including synaptic signaling, epigenetic modification, and hormonal regulation. Genetic perturbations within these networks cause abnormal BMI phenotypes in mice, too, supporting their broad conservation across mammals. Other mechanisms appear species specific, including carbohydrate biosynthesis (humans) and glycerolipid metabolism (rodents). Finally, network co-localization also identifies cross-species convergence for height/body length.

Community. Aligned with an IKT approach, an SCI organization was meaningfully engaged throughout the research process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people with SCI who have quit or tried to quit smoking. Barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation were extracted and deductively coded using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and inductively analysed. To identify intervention options, a behavioural analysis was conducted using the Behaviour Change Wheel. To identify implementation options, modes of delivery and intervention messengers were extracted. Modes of delivery were deductively coded, and themes relating to intervention messengers were constructed. Among the 12 participants (7 males; 6 with tetraplegia), seven had quit and five had relapsed. Across the 12 interviews, 130 barriers and 218 facilitators were coded to the TDF. The prominent TDF domains were beliefs about consequences, social influences, environmental context and resources, and behavioural regulation, and served as themes in the inductive analysis. Multiple modes of delivery and intervention messengers were considered important for the delivery of smoking cessation interventions. This study is the first to use IKT and theory-based approaches to explore factors influencing smoking cessation among persons with SCI. Findings from this study resulted in the co-development of practical recommendations for future SCI-specific smoking cessation interventions.},

For example, the collectivism, interdependence and tightness of Eastern cultures relative to the individualism, independence and looseness of Western cultures, promote interpersonal connectedness and coordination. Do such cultural contexts therefore influence the group-level variability of their cultural members' spontaneous brain activity? Using novel methods adapted from studies of inter-subject neural synchrony, we compare the group-level variability of resting state EEG dynamics in Chinese and Canadian samples. We observe that Chinese subjects show significantly higher inter-subject correlation and lower inter-subject distance in their EEG power spectra than Canadian subjects, as well as lower variability in theta power and alpha peak frequency. We demonstrate, for the first time, different relationships among subjects' resting state brain dynamics in Chinese and Canadian samples. These results point to more idiosyncratic neural dynamics among Canadian participants, compared with more shared neural features in Chinese participants.},

Home health nursing agencies (HHNAs) are expected to demonstrate that the care provided does make a difference for the client receiving the services.

Outcome indicators include: Services utilized (emergency services, re-hospitalization), physiological status (catheter indwelling status, consciousness level, wound severity-number and wound stages) and functional status (reflected by Barthel Index). A prospective research design was used to collect the results. Five hospital-based HHNAs were invited to participate in this research. Clients newly admitted to HHNAs and diagnosed as non-cancer patients were recruited, and the researchers gathered outcome indicators over a six-month period. Data were analyzed using SPSS 8.0 computer software. There were 75 clients in this study. Results showed that most of the clients (64.0%) received service for more than 180 days. The client characteristics were dominated by elderly (66.6% age above 70), female (53.3%) and married (74.7%). The three leading care needs were NG tubing service (84.0%), Foley tubing service (45.3%) and wound care (38.7%). The Kruscal Wallis Test revealed that there was no difference in emergency service frequency and re-hospitalization between clients who received service for more than 180 days and those who received service for less than 180 days. The Wilcoxon Sign rank test showed that within one half-year, catheter indwelling status, functional status, and wound severity were not significantly different, with the exception only of conscious level (p = .001). The results of this study can be viewed as preliminary data to assist in shaping home health nursing services in Taiwan.},

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes, used in Western countries since 1980, have not been readily used in Taiwanese long-term care facilities since their introduction in 1995. Instead, nasogastric tubes are used for extended periods. The reasons for limited percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use among long-term care residents are unknown. A phenomenologic qualitative design using in-depth semi-structured interviews collected the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use experiences of directors of long-term care facilities. The directors also provided descriptive data on the prevalence of feeding tubes among their residents. Eight directors of long-term care facilities in southern Taiwan participated in tape-recorded interviews. Data were thematically analysed using the methods of Strauss and Corbin. Feeding tube prevalence data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Four themes emerged as contributing to limited percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use in long-term care facilities: acceptability, availability, affordability and accountability. Over one-third of the residents required feeding tubes with 97% of those having nasogastric tube. Nasogastric tubes were used for a year or more in over half of the patients requiring enteral feeding. Chinese cultural values play a significant role in influencing end-of-life care and decisions about percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use. Nursing directors in long-term care assume a gatekeeper role to promote acceptability, provide availability and ensure accountability of nutritional interventions. Policy makers must be engaged to promote the affordability of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use among long-term care residents. To improve nutritional outcomes among long-term care residents, nurses must acknowledge the Chinese culture related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes. Professionals must provide sufficient information about the advantages of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and discuss with families the meaning of quality of life and suffering at the end-of-life.},

The neck masses twisted the aryepiglottic fold tortuously and clogged the laryngeal aperture tightly, making a flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope unable to pass through the laryngeal aperture. Later, we utilized a McCoy laryngoscope alternately to lift the compressed larynx up and away from the posterior pharyngeal wall, creating a passage and completing endotracheal intubation successfully with the aid of a gum elastic bougie. Our case suggested that the tilting tip blade of the McCoy laryngoscope could lever the tongue base up against the tumor mass compression to improve laryngeal views and facilitate endotracheal intubation when a difficult fiber-optic intubation was encountered on a compressed laryngeal aperture.},

Whereas other proficiency components (ie, cognitive knowledge and manual dexterity) can be tested, workflow understanding is difficult to define and assess due to its contextual and institution-specific nature. The objective was to define the workflow components of specific perioperative US applications using an iterative process to reach a consensus opinion. Expert consensus, survey study. Tertiary university hospital. This study sought expert consensus among a focus group of 9 members of an anesthesia department with experience in perioperative US. Afterward, 257 anesthesia faculty members from 133 academic centers across the United States were surveyed. A preliminary list of tasks was designed to establish the expectations of workflow understanding by an anesthesiology resident prior to clinical exposure to perioperative US. This list was modified by a focus group through an iterative process. Afterwards, a survey was sent to faculty members nationwide, and Likert scale ratings for each task were obtained and reviewed during a second round. Consensus among members of the focus group was reached after 2 iterations. 72 participants responded to the nationwide survey (28%), and consensus was reached after the second round (Cronbach's α = 0.99, ICC = 0.99) on a final list of 46 workflow-related tasks. Specific components of perioperative US workflow were identified. Evaluation of workflow understanding may be combined with cognitive knowledge and manual dexterity testing for assessing proficiency in perioperative US.},

The RAARR algorithm can automatically assign experimental spectra under a broad range of conditions, including spectra comprised of multiple mixture components, in ≲100 s. The RAARR algorithm exploits constraints placed by the conservation of energy to find sets of connected lines in an unassigned spectrum. The highly constrained structure of these sets eliminates all but a handful of plausible assignments for a given set, greatly reducing the number of potential assignments that must be evaluated. We successfully apply our algorithm to automatically assign 15 experimental spectra, including 5 previously unassigned species, without prior estimation of molecular rotational constants. In 9 of the 15 cases, the RAARR algorithm successfully assigns two or more mixture components.},

  abstract = {A novel family of transcripts that span the junction between the long and short segments of the herpes simplex virus type 1 genome has been identified. These transcripts, designated L/S junction-spanning transcripts (L/STs), are synthesized in abundance in a variety of cells infected with mutant viruses defective in the gene for ICP4, the major transcriptional regulatory protein of the virus. Transcription of abundant 2.3- and 8.5-kb series of L/STs was shown to initiate within the same sequences as less abundant 4.2-, 7.3-, and > 9.5-kb transcripts by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. S1 nuclease analysis revealed a single 5' terminus 28 bp downstream of a TATA box and 6 bp downstream of a consensus ICP4 binding site. The location of the transcriptional start site indicates that the promoter of the L/STs likely corresponds to the bidirectional promoter described by Bohenzky et al. (R. A. Bohenzky, A. G. Papavassiliou, I. H. Gelman, and S. Silverstein, J. Virol. 67:632-642, 1993). The L/STs accumulate with late kinetics in ICP4 mutant-infected cells and are polyadenylated. Mutant viruses encoding forms of ICP4 unable to bind the consensus site, ATCGTC, exhibited abundant expression of the L/STs, whereas mutants encoding forms of ICP4 able to bind this site expressed no detectable L/STs, suggesting that ICP4 plays a critical role in repressing L/ST expression. Their synthesis in ICP4 mutant-infected cells is inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating that they are induced either by an immediate-early viral protein other than ICP4 or by a virus-induced cellular protein. Preliminary evidence indicates that the L/STs are not present in latently infected ganglia. The abundant expression of the L/STs with late kinetics only in the absence of functional ICP4 and the sensitivity of their synthesis to cycloheximide indicate that they are not members of any of the recognized kinetic classes of herpes simplex virus type 1 transcripts but constitute a new class of viral transcript.},

Findings on MR arthrography and those derived from careful dissection of gross specimens were compared in 15 cadaver shoulders, focusing on the morphology and size of the superior and middle glenohumeral ligaments and the morphology of the inferior glenohumeral ligament. The frequencies of sublabral recess and sublabral foramen seen on MR arthrography and at anatomic dissection were also compared. For the superior and middle glenohumeral ligaments, moderate correlation of size was found between measurements made on MR arthrograms and at anatomic dissection, with the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient calculated as .69990 and .71133, respectively. Morphologic descriptions of the inferior glenohumeral ligament based on MR arthrography and on anatomic dissection also showed good association (Cohen's kappa = .8936). Dissection revealed that the sublabral recess was present in 11 specimens. Of these, 10 recesses were identified on MR arthrograms. MR arthrography also revealed a sublabral recess that was not found at dissection. Four sublabral foramina were identified by both MR arthrography and dissection, and two were revealed only by MR arthrography. MR arthrography is useful in the evaluation of the glenohumeral ligaments and the superior portion of the labrum. Anatomic variations of these anterior intraarticular structures can be accurately shown by MR arthrography. In addition, estimation of the size of glenohumeral ligaments can be achieved with acceptable accuracy on MR arthrograms.},

  abstract = {There is much data showing correlation between forskolin-induced relaxation and production of cyclic AMP. But are these processes coupled or two phenomena occurring in parallel? This question was studied in guinea-pig cerebral vessels by using NPY as a strong inhibitor and alpha-trinositol as its antagonist. The basal cyclic AMP content of cerebral vessel segments in the control group was 670 +/- 53 fmol/mg wet weight (w.w.). Forskolin (10(-7), 3 x 10(-7) and 10(-6) M) increased the formation of cyclic AMP to 738 +/- 86 (ns), 699 +/- 81 (ns) and 1158 +/- 132 fmol/mg w.w. (p < 0.05), respectively. alpha-trinositol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) neither reduced the formation of cyclic AMP compared to basal cyclic AMP levels nor affected the forskolin-stimulated increase of cyclic AMP (p > 0.05). On the other hand, NPY (10(-7) M) not only decreased basal formation of cyclic AMP (p < 0.05) but also attenuated the forskolin-stimulated increase of cyclic AMP (p < 0.005). The inhibitory effects of NPY on both basal levels of cyclic AMP and forskolin-induced increase of cyclic AMP were not reversed by the application of alpha-trinositol (10(-8)-10(-6) M). In studies on vasomotor responses, forskolin (10(-9)-10(-5) M) induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of precontracted guinea-pig basilar arteries. NPY (10(-7) M) shifted the forskolin-induced relaxation of the basilar arteries towards higher forskolin concentrations. This inhibitory effect of NPY was reversed by alpha-trinositol (10(-6) M). We conclude that 1) NPY decreases basal and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP levels; 2) alpha-trinositol neither reverses the inhibitory effect of NPY on nor modulates basal or forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP levels; 3) However, the antagonistic effect of NPY on forskolin-induced relaxation is significantly reversed by administration of alpha-trinositol. This demonstrates a dissociation of the dilator effects of forskolin and its generation of cyclic AMP.},

To present the results of the long-term follow-up of a cohort of patients with JEB-H, and to provide guidelines for prognosis, treatment and care. All patients with JEB-H included in the Dutch Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) Registry between 1988 and 2011 were followed longitudinally by our EB team. Diagnosis was established using immunofluorescence antigen mapping, electron microscopy and DNA analysis. In total, we included 22 patients with JEB-H over a 23-year period. Their average age at death was 5.8 months (range 0.5-32.6 months). The causes of death were, in order of frequency: failure to thrive, respiratory failure, pneumonia, dehydration, anaemia, sepsis and euthanasia. The pattern of initial weight gain was a predictor of lifespan in these patients. Invasive treatments to extend life did not promote survival in our patients. It is important to diagnose JEB-H as soon as possible after birth so that the management can be shifted from life-saving to comfort care. The palliative end-of-life care can take place in hospital, but is also safe in the home setting. Suffering in patients with JEB-H can become so unbearable that in some patients who do not respond to adequate analgesic and sedative treatment, newborn euthanasia, performed according to the Groningen protocol, is legally permitted in the Netherlands.},

Hence, this study aimed to assess the interest, training, beliefs, and knowledge about hypnosis in the operating room staff. A questionnaire with 21-items, based on a prior survey, was set up on an online platform. The medical and nursing anesthesiology staff of four Swiss academic and large regional hospitals (N = 754) were invited to participate anonymously through e-mails sent by their hierarchy. Results were analyzed quantitatively. Between June, 2020 and August, 2021 353 answers were collected (47% response rate). Most (92%) were aware that hypnosis needs specific training, with 14% trained. A large majority of the untrained staff wished to enroll for conversational hypnosis training. There was a strong agreement for hypnosis playing a role in anesthesia. Nevertheless, many of these professionals believed that hypnosis has a limited field of action (53%) or that it would be too time consuming (33%). The reduction of misconceptions was based more on exposure to hypnosis than on training. Overall, anesthesia providers' attitude was in favor of using hypnosis in the operating room. Misconceptions such as a prolongation of the procedure, alteration of consent, lack of acceptability for patients, and limited indications were identified as potential barriers. These deserve to be challenged through proper dissemination of the recent scientific literature and exposure to practice.},

It was found that all these parameters increased under the influence of these cytokines. The release of calcium--used as a parameter of bone resorption--was highest in the combined presence of the cytokines. Although the absolute and relative enhancement by a combination of IL-1 alpha and EGF was most pronounced for collagenase (7-fold), both gelatinase A (5-fold) and gelatinase B (1.5-fold) had increased simultaneously. Calvariae produced a high level of MMP inhibitor (TIMP-1), especially under the influence of the cytokines; periosteum released little inhibitor.

Medical records (n = 149) of patients treated between 2008 and 2012 were collected between November 2012 and August 2013.

Pain recognition was perceived as difficult, as patients were said to suppress or to exaggerate pain, and to have different expectations regarding acceptable pain levels. HCP reported a fear of side effects of pain medication, shortage and irregularities in the supply of pain medication, and time constraints among medical doctors for pain management.

  abstract = {Chronic pancreatitis is defined as a disease of the pancreas in which recurrent inflammatory episodes result in replacement of the pancreatic parenchyma by fibrous connective tissue in individuals with genetic, environmental, and other risk factors. Pain is one of the most important symptoms of chronic pancreatitis and, in many cases, has chronic visceral nociceptive, nociplastic, and even neuropathic components, with evidence of both central and peripheral sensitization, neuroplasticity, and neurogenic inflammation. The literature on the diagnosis and treatment of pain in chronic pancreatitis was reviewed and summarized. Treatment of abdominal pain in chronic pancreatitis is guided by pancreatic morphology on imaging, although the correlation between pain symptoms and pathoanatomical changes is not always straightforward. Patients with pancreatic duct obstruction are initially offered endoscopic or surgical therapies, while non-obstructive disease is mostly managed medically. Lifestyle changes and psychological support are of particular importance for all chronic pancreatitis patients. Analgesic options range from non-opioid medications to opioids and adjuvant agents. Interventional pain management may consist of radiofrequency treatment of the splanchnic nerves and spinal cord stimulation. To date, there are no randomized trials supporting their efficacy in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain, and the recommendation to consider these treatment options is justified by evidence from observational studies. Possible opioid-sparing effects of interventional pain treatments are important to consider because opioid use and dependency are common in chronic pancreatitis patients and associated with worse outcomes. Celiac plexus block is not generally recommended for chronic pancreatitis due to the limited quality of evidence, overall short duration of effect, and invasiveness of the procedure. Central sensitization can impact the effectiveness of invasive treatments. Managing pain in chronic pancreatitis is a complex task that requires a multidimensional and individualized approach. Due to the lack of randomized trials, treatment decisions are often guided by expert opinion. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions and collaborating with a multidisciplinary team are key components of effective chronic pancreatitis pain management.},

The initial process for N-linked glycosylation shares a common pathway with assembly of a dolichol-linked core oligosaccharide. Here we characterize a new Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lew3 (leaf wilting 3), which has a defect in an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, a homolog of ALG11 in yeast, that transfers mannose to the dolichol-linked core oligosaccharide in the last two steps on the cytosolic face of the ER in N-glycan precursor synthesis. LEW3 is localized to the ER membrane and expressed throughout the plant. Mutation of LEW3 caused low-level accumulation of Man(3)GlcNAc(2) and Man(4)GlcNAc(2) glycans, structures that are seldom detected in wild-type plants. In addition, the lew3 mutant has low levels of normal high-mannose-type glycans, but increased levels of complex-type glycans. The lew3 mutant showed abnormal developmental phenotypes, reduced fertility, impaired cellulose synthesis, abnormal primary cell walls, and xylem collapse due to disturbance of the secondary cell walls. lew3 mutants were more sensitive to osmotic stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Protein N-glycosylation was reduced and the unfolded protein response was more activated by osmotic stress and ABA treatment in the lew3 mutant than in the wild-type. These results demonstrate that protein N-glycosylation plays crucial roles in plant development and the response to abiotic stresses.},

  abstract = {Flooding is a compound stress, imposing strong limitations on plant development. The expression of adaptive traits that alleviate flooding stress may be constrained if floodwater levels are too deep. For instance, adventitious root outgrowth is typically less profound in completely submerged plants than in partially submerged plants, suggesting additional constraints in full submergence. As both oxygen and carbohydrates are typically limited resources under submergence, we tested the effects of oxygen concentration in the floodwater and carbohydrate status of the plants on flooding-induced adventitious root formation in Solanum dulcamara L. Partially submerged plants continued to form adventitious roots in low-oxygen floodwater, whereas completely submerged plants developed hardly any roots, even in floodwater with twice the ambient oxygen concentration. This suggests that contact with the atmosphere, enabling internal aeration, is much more important to optimal adventitious root formation than floodwater oxygen concentrations. If plants were depleted of carbohydrates before flooding, adventitious root formation in partial submergence was poor, unless high light was provided. Thus, either stored or newly produced carbohydrates can fuel adventitious root formation. These results imply that the impact of an environmental stress factor like flooding on plant performance may strongly depend on the interplay with other environmental factors.},

  abstract = {Endothelial pro-inflammatory activation plays a pivotal role in atherosclerosis, and many pro-inflammatory and atherogenic signals converge upon mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Inhibitors of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) reduced atherosclerosis in preclinical studies, but side effects including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia limit their clinical use in this context. Therefore, we investigated PRAS40, a cell type-specific endogenous modulator of mTORC1, as alternative target. Indeed, we previously found PRAS40 gene therapy to improve metabolic profile; however, its function in endothelial cells and its role in atherosclerosis remain unknown. Here we show that PRAS40 negatively regulates endothelial mTORC1 and pro-inflammatory signaling. Knockdown of PRAS40 in endothelial cells promoted TNFα-induced mTORC1 signaling, proliferation, upregulation of inflammatory markers and monocyte recruitment. In contrast, PRAS40-overexpression blocked mTORC1 and all measures of pro-inflammatory signaling. These effects were mimicked by pharmacological mTORC1-inhibition with torin1. In an in vivo model of atherogenic remodeling, mice with induced endothelium-specific PRAS40 deficiency showed enhanced endothelial pro-inflammatory activation as well as increased neointimal hyperplasia and atherosclerotic lesion formation. These data indicate that PRAS40 suppresses atherosclerosis via inhibition of endothelial mTORC1-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling. In conjunction with its favourable effects on metabolic homeostasis, this renders PRAS40 a potential target for the treatment of atherosclerosis.},

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a daily prediction model for next-day disease severity in ICU patients. Data from the Simple Intensive Care Studies-II prospective cohort study of acutely admitted critically ill adults, including data collected during the first 7 days of admission such as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score-related measurements, were used to fit a mixed-effects logistic regression model for next-day deterioration. Deterioration was defined as a decline in the total (≥2) and organ-specific (≥1) SOFA scores. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. A total of 1009 patients were included. The final predictive model for overall next-day deterioration included six predictors (the total SOFA score on the current day, the minimum value of arterial pH, Glasgow Coma Scale score, mean arterial blood pressure, mechanical ventilation, and its effect differing between the first and subsequent ICU days). The model achieved an AUC of 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.78). In the decision curve analysis, within probability thresholds of 0.2-0.5, the model showed a higher net benefit than did strategies of treating all patients or treating no patients. Organ-specific prediction models for next-day deterioration in respiration, cardiovascular, and renal function showed slightly better performance than the overall model (AUCs: 0.79, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively). Daily prediction models can predict next-day disease severity in overall, respiration, cardiovascular, and renal function amongst ICU patients. They offer clinical benefits within a range of probability thresholds and could support decision-making for ICU physicians.},

We used total and water leachable toxic metal concentrations and 2 benthic organism-based bioassays to identify suitable DWTR substrates for introduction to freshwater systems. Using total metal contents and the consensus probable effect concentration concept, 3 DWTRs were selected and used in elutriate and toxicity studies. The concentrations of water leachable Ag, As, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb, and Zn were below the US Environmental Protection Agency's ambient water quality criteria. Using the long-term 65-d life cycle Chironomus tentans test and 4 different endpoints (survival, adult emergence, egg case production, and number of eggs produced per female), no statistical differences were found between the DWTR treatments and the controls. Similarly, results obtained using the 10-d Hyalella azteca test showed no toxicity. However, although both survival and growth were recorded in all bioassays, the results of the 10-d C. tentans and the 28-d H. azteca tests were ambiguous. For C. tentans, 2 of the 3 DWTRs resulted in significantly lower survival rates compared to the controls. For H. azteca, no significant growth differences were observed between controls and DWTR treatments, but 2 of the 3 DWTRs resulted in significantly lower survival rates than the controls.

To assess how DWTRs can be repurposed to limit the mobility of metals in aquatic systems, we tested their propensity to release toxic metals and their potential ecotoxicity. To account for the wide variability in their physicochemical characteristics, DWTR samples were obtained from 15 water-treatment plants across the United States. A screening procedure based on a combination of 1) the toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP), 2) total metal contents and sediment quality guidelines, and 3) acute 10-d Americamysis bahia and chronic 28-d Neanthes arenaceodentata survival and growth bioassays was used. All tested samples were found to be nonhazardous based on TCLP results. However, the concentrations of As, Cu, and Ni exceeded the sediment quality guidelines in some samples, resulting in the exclusion of 7 DWTR samples. All of the DWTRs evaluated for toxicity were nontoxic to the tested organisms. The results of the present study suggest that certain DWTRs can be introduced safely into the marine environment and, therefore, used as potential amendments or capping materials to control the mobility of certain sediment contaminants.

No significant difference in revision rate per 100 component-years was found between stemless, short-stem, and conventional stemmed implants (revision rate per 100 component-years: conventional, 1.01 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89-1.14]; short, 0.54 [95% CI 0.25-1.03]; stemless, 0.99 [95% CI 0.51-1.74]). This finding was irrespective of patient age or surgeon volume. There were no cases of humeral loosening up to 7 years' follow-up and no cases of intraoperative humeral fracture in the stemless group. Functional outcomes at 6 months postsurgery suggested better outcomes in the stemless group compared with the conventional stem group (mean Oxford Shoulder Score: conventional, 39.4; stemless, 40.7; P value = .023). The medium-term survival of stemless implants for anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty appears comparable to short-stem and conventional stemmed implants.

Our study aims to calculate a patient's lifetime revision risk after primary anatomic (aTSA) and reverse (rTSA) total shoulder arthroplasty-a more meaningful projection of revision risk over a patient's remaining lifetime. The New Zealand Joint Registry (NZJR) and national death data was used to calculate the incidence of revision and mortality in all patients who underwent primary aTSA and rTSA in New Zealand between 1999 and 2021. Lifetime revision risk was calculated using previously described methods, and this risk was stratified by age (46-90 years, 5-year bins), sex, and procedure type (aTSA and rTSA). In total, there were 4346 patients in the aTSA cohort and 7384 patients in the rTSA cohort. Lifetime revision risk was highest in the youngest age group (46-50 years) at 35.8% (95% CI 34.5%-37.0%) for aTSA and 30.9% (95% CI 29.9%-32.0%) for rTSA, with risk decreasing with increasing age. Across all age groups, the lifetime revision risk was higher for aTSA compared to rTSA. By sex, females reported higher lifetime revision risk for each age group in the aTSA cohort whereas males reported higher lifetime revision risk for each group in the rTSA cohort. Our study demonstrates that younger patients have higher lifetime revision risk after total shoulder arthroplasty. Our results highlight the long-term revision risks associated with the trend of offering shoulder arthroplasty to younger patients. The data may be used among various health care stakeholders to inform the surgical decision-making process and plan for future health care resource use.},

In total, 98,156 patients with a median follow-up of 7.25 years (range, 0.00 to 23.74) were included. Over the entire follow-up period, 22,938 patients (23.4%) had died. The overall SMR for the TKA cohort was 1.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06 to 1.09), suggesting that TKA patients have an 8% higher mortality rate compared to the general population. However, a reduction in short-term mortality rate was observed for TKA patients up to 5 years post TKA (SMR 5 years post TKA; 0.59 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.60]). On the contrary, a significantly increased long-term mortality rate was observed in TKA patients with greater than 11 years of follow-up, particularly in men over the age of 75 years (SMR 11 to 15 years post TKA for males ≥ 75 years; 3.13 [95% CI: 2.95 to 3.31]). The results suggest a reduction in short-term mortality rate for patients who undergo primary TKA. However, there is an increased long-term mortality rate particularly in men over the age of 75 years. Importantly, the mortality rates observed in this study cannot be causally attributed to TKA alone.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to compare medium-term results of inlay and onlay humeral components in reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA). Specifically, we report differences in revision rate and functional outcomes between the 2 designs. The 3 most used inlay (in-RSA) and onlay (on-RSA) implants by volume from the New Zealand Joint Registry were included in the study. In-RSA was defined as having a humeral tray that recessed within the metaphyseal bone, whereas on-RSA was defined as having a humeral tray that rested on the epiphyseal osteotomy surface. The primary outcome was revision up to 8 years postsurgery. Secondary outcomes included the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), implant survival, and revision cause for in-RSA and on-RSA as well as individual prostheses. There were 6707 patients (5736 in-RSA; 971 on-RSA) included in the study. For all causes, in-RSA demonstrated a lower revision rate compared to on-RSA (revision rate/100 component years: in-RSA 0.665, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.569-0.768; on-RSA 1.010, 95% CI 0.673-1.415). However, the mean 6-month OSS was higher for the on-RSA group (mean difference 2.20, 95% CI 1.37-3.03; P < .001). However, this was not clinically significant. At 5 years, there were no statistically or clinically significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to the OSS. The medium-term survival of in-RSA was higher than that of on-RSA. However, functional outcomes at 6 months were better for on-RSA compared to in-RSA. Further follow-up is required to understand the long-term survivorship and functional outcomes between these designs.},

Understanding long-term mortality trends in these patients is crucial for improving care and informing health economic analyses. Data from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (2004-2022) were analysed. Patients who underwent primary RSA or HA for PHF were included. Mortality rates were calculated using standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and compared to the general Australian population, with subgroup analyses based on age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score. A total of 7868 RSA and 3006 HA procedures were reviewed. PHF patients undergoing RSA or HA had significantly higher mortality rates than the general population, with an increasing trend over 15 years. Higher mortality was associated with younger age, male gender, extreme BMI, and higher ASA scores. PHF patients receiving acute arthroplasty face higher long-term mortality, influenced by demographic and clinical factors. These findings underscore the need for optimised care and healthcare policy adjustments for this vulnerable group. Further research is required to establish causality and improve outcomes.},

One of the peculiarities of immunogenic apoptosis is the early cell surface exposure of calreticulin (CRT), a protein that usually resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). When elicited by anthracyclines or oxaliplatin, the CRT exposure pathway is activated by pre-apoptotic ER stress and the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2alpha by the kinase PERK, followed by caspase-8-mediated proteolysis of the ER-sessile protein BAP31, activation of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, anterograde transport of CRT from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and exocytosis of CRT-containing vesicles, finally resulting in CRT translocation onto the plasma membrane surface. Interruption of this complex pathway abolishes CRT exposure, annihilates the immunogenicity of apoptosis, and reduces the immune response elicited by anticancer chemotherapies. We speculate that human cancers that are incapable of activating the CRT exposure pathway are refractory to the immune-mediated component of anticancer therapies.},

If MET1 is removed in a mutant background, CG methylation is lost and is only restored in specific heterochromatic regions that have maintained competence for re-methylation due to the presence of small RNAs and the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway that controls de novo DNA methylation functions. We analysed re-methylation at a locus that loses body methylation in an met1 mutant. We found that body methylation at this locus is at least partially restored when MET1 is re-introduced into the met1 mutant background, either via genetic cross or DNA transfer. Re-methylation is region-specific but random with respect to individual CG targets, does not require passage through the germline, and its efficiency appears to be influenced by transcription. This suggests that, at least at some loci, MET1 has de novo methylation activity that can restore lost body methylation patterns. We propose that this activity helps to stabilize body methylation patterns, and the random target site selection probably also enhances the variability of body methylation patterns.},

The method was applied in an experimental paradigm where a subject and an investigator communicated in an interactive verbal generation task during fMRI. By applying online active noise cancellation, the quality of the subject's speech was substantially improved.

Playing violent racing games may change functional brain connectivity, in particular and even after controlling for event frequency, in the reward network and the DMN.

Disturbances of these mechanisms on multiple levels of neural processing may contribute to clinical symptoms in major depression (MD). A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted to identify neurobiological foundations of altered mismatch processing in MD. Twenty-five patients with major depression and 25 matched healthy individuals completed an auditory mismatch paradigm optimized for fMRI. Brain activity during mismatch processing was compared between groups. Moreover, seed-based connectivity analyses investigated depression-specific brain networks. In patients, mismatch processing was associated with reduced activation in the right auditory cortex as well as in a fronto-parietal attention network. Moreover, functional coupling between the right auditory cortex and frontal areas was reduced in patients. Seed-to voxel analysis on the whole-brain level revealed reduced connectivity between the auditory cortex and the thalamus as well as posterior cingulate. The present study indicates deficits in sensory processing on the level of the auditory cortex in depression. Hyposensitivity in a fronto-parietal network presumably reflects altered attention mechanisms in depression. The observed impairments may contribute to psychopathology by reducing the ability of the affected individuals to orient attention toward important environmental cues.},

In particular, studies indicate altered functional coupling between nodes of the language and default mode networks. Neurofeedback based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) can be used to modulate such aberrant network connectivity. We investigated resting-state connectivity changes after neurofeedback (NF) in 21 patients with schizophrenia and 35 healthy individuals. All participants underwent two days of neurofeedback training of important nodes of the left-hemispheric language network including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). In a double-blind randomized cross-over design, participants learned to down- and up-regulate their brain activation in the designated target regions based on NF. Prior to and after each training day, a resting state measurement took place. Coupling between nodes of the language and the default mode network (DMN) selectively increased after down-as compared to up-regulation NF. Network analyses revealed more pronounced increases in functional connectivity between nodes of the language network and the DMN in patients compared to healthy individuals. In particular, down-regulation NF led to increased coupling between nodes of the language network and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (IPL) as well as posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus in patients. Up-regulation strengthened connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Improved well-being four weeks after the training predicted increased functional coupling between the left IFG and left IPL. Modulatory effects emerged as increased internetwork communication, indicating that down-regulation NF selectively enhances coupling between language and DM network nodes in patients with AVH. RtfMRI NF may thus be used to modulate brain network function that is relevant to the phenomenology of AVH. Specific effects of self-regulation on symptom improvement have to be explored in therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Traumatic experiences are associated with neurofunctional dysregulations in key regions of the emotion regulation circuits. In particular, amygdala responsivity to negative stimuli is exaggerated while engagement of prefrontal regulatory control regions is attenuated. Successful application of emotion regulation (ER) strategies may counteract this disbalance, however, application of learned strategies in daily life is hampered in individuals afflicted by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized that a single session of real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) guided upregulation of prefrontal regions during an emotion regulation task enhances self-control during exposure to negative stimuli and facilitates transfer of the learned ER skills to daily life. In a cross-over design, individuals with a PTSD diagnosis after a single traumatic event (n = 20) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria and individuals without a formal psychiatric diagnosis (n = 21) underwent a cognitive reappraisal training. In randomized order, all participants completed two rtfMRI neurofeedback (NF) runs targeting the left lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and two control runs without NF (NoNF) while using cognitive reappraisal to reduce their emotional response to negative scenes. During the NoNF runs, two %%-signs were displayed instead of the two-digit feedback (FB) to achieve a comparable visual stimulation. The project aimed at defining the clinical potential of the training according to three success markers: (1) NF induced changes in left lateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala activity during the regulation of aversive scenes compared to cognitive reappraisal alone (primary registered outcome), (2) associated changes on the symptomatic and behavioral level such as indicated by PTSD symptom severity and affect ratings, (3) clinical utility such as indicated by perceived efficacy, acceptance, and transfer to daily life measured four weeks after the training. In comparison to the reappraisal without feedback, a neurofeedback-specific decrease in the left lateral PFC (d = 0.54) alongside an attenuation of amygdala responses (d = 0.33) emerged. Reduced amygdala responses during NF were associated with symptom improvement (r = -0.42) and less negative affect (r = -0.63) at follow-up. The difference in symptom scores exceeds requirements for a minimal clinically important difference and corresponds to a medium effect size (d = 0.64). Importantly, 75% of individuals with PTSD used the strategies in daily life during a one-month follow-up period and perceived the training as efficient. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of the NF training indicated by reduced amygdala responses that were associated with improved symptom severity and affective state four weeks after the NF training as well as patient-centered perceived control during the training, helpfulness and application of strategies in daily life. However, reduced prefrontal involvement was unexpected. The study suggests good tolerability of the training protocol and potential for clinical use in the treatment of PTSD.},

  abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to study the ultrastructural effects of white light on the retinas of pigmented rabbits. The retinas were exposed to white light (400-740 nm) at intensities between 65 and 140 mW/cm2 for 1 h. Two days after exposure, the increased leakage of fluorescein measured with vitreous fluorophotometry could be mimicked on electron microscopy by the tracers ferrous gluconate and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In cases of minimal fluorescein leakage, traces of HRP were found in the basal folds of the retina pigment epithelium (RPE). No HRP was observed apical to the tight junctions of the RPE cells. When there was a great amount of fluorescein leakage, HRP completely filled the RPE cytoplasm, the extracellular spaces, and several cells in the neuroretina. It is concluded that after exposure to low intensities of white light, blood-retina barrier dysfunction may be due to disruption of the RPE basal fold membrane, leading to increased transcellular passage. The intact tight junctions suggest the under these circumstances intercellular leakage is not a component of BRB dysfunction.},
