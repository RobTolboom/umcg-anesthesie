  abstract = {Intranasal midazolam can produce procedural sedation in frail older patients with dementia who are unable to tolerate necessary medical or dental procedures during domiciliary medical care. Little is known about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intranasal midazolam in older (>65 yr old) people. The aim of this study was to understand the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of intranasal midazolam in older people with the primary goal of developing a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to facilitate safer domiciliary sedation care. We recruited 12 volunteers: ASA physical status 1-2, aged 65-80 yr, and received midazolam 5 mg intravenously and 5 mg intranasally on two study days separated by a 6 day washout period. Concentrations of venous midazolam and 1'-OH-midazolam, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score, bispectral index (BIS), arterial pressure, ECG, and respiratory parameters were measured for 10 h. Time to peak effect of intranasal midazolam for BIS, MAP, and SpO Intranasal bioavailability was high and sedation onset was rapid, with maximum sedative effects after 32 min. We developed a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for intranasal midazolam for older persons and an online tool to simulate changes in MOAA/S, BIS, MAP, and SpO EudraCT (2019-004806-90).},

While widely used in the operating room, their application in the intensive care unit (ICU) remains limited despite the complexity of drug dosing in critically ill patients. This scoping review evaluates existing evidence on the use of TCI systems in ICU settings, focusing on sedation, analgesia, and antibiotic administration. A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline and the Cochrane Library up to August 2024. Studies involving adult ICU patients receiving TCI for any drug were included. Data were extracted on study design, PKPD models, performance metrics, and clinical endpoints. A total of 281 studies were identified; 14 focused on sedatives, particularly propofol and remifentanil, using the Marsh and Minto models. TCI was associated with more stable sedation, improved titration, and fewer adverse events. Evidence on dexmedetomidine and midazolam was limited. Only three studies explored antibiotic TCI, mainly for vancomycin and cefepime, showing potential but lacking robust clinical validation. In conclusion, while current findings are promising, the evidence base supporting TCI-especially in the context of newer, generalized pharmacokinetic models and antibiotics-remains insufficient, and its broader application requires further clinical research and model validation.},

  abstract = {Etomidate is a hypnotic agent that is used for the induction of anesthesia. It produces its effect by acting as a positive allosteric modulator on the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor and thus enhancing the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid. Etomidate stands out among other anesthetic agents by having a remarkably stable cardiorespiratory profile, producing no cardiovascular or respiratory depression. However, etomidate suppresses the adrenocortical axis by the inhibition of the enzyme 11β-hydroxylase. This makes the drug unsuitable for administration by a prolonged infusion. It also makes the drug unsuitable for administration to critically ill patients. Etomidate has relatively large volumes of distributions and is rapidly metabolized by hepatic esterases into an inactive carboxylic acid through hydrolyzation. Because of the decrease in popularity of etomidate, few modern extensive pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies exist. Over the last decade, several analogs of etomidate have been developed, with the aim of retaining its stable cardiorespiratory profile, whilst eliminating its suppressive effect on the adrenocortical axis. One of these molecules, ABP-700, was studied in extensive phase I clinical trials. These found that ABP-700 is characterized by small volumes of distribution and rapid clearance. ABP-700 is metabolized similarly to etomidate, by hydrolyzation into an inactive carboxylic acid. Furthermore, ABP-700 showed a rapid onset and offset of clinical effect. One side effect observed with both etomidate and ABP-700 is the occurrence of involuntary muscle movements. The origin of these movements is unclear and warrants further research.},

  abstract = {Many patients experience nausea and vomiting after surgery, which can be very uncomfortable and may delay recovery. Despite preventive medications, this problem remains common, particularly in women, non-smokers and those with a previous history of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Our research aimed to improve PONV prevention for a quicker, and more comfortable recovery.
  We identified groups more likely to experience PONV, focusing on clinical factors, ethnicity and genetics. Notably, a specific gene (the C allele of P2RX7) may protect against vomiting. We also confirmed that individuals with a prior PONV or motion sickness are at a higher risk of experiencing it again. These insights could guide more personalised PONV prevention strategies in the future.
  Our study also evaluated medicines like olanzapine, aprepitant, and fosaprepitant. Combining certain drugs significantly reduced PONV, while others were less effective. Olanzapine, typically used for mental health conditions, worked well alongside standard treatments, significantly lowering the chances of PONV. However, aprepitant, a drug specifically approved to prevent PONV, did not show much benefit when combined with another drug called palonosetron. After reviewing available studies, we concluded that while these medications help prevent PONV, their effectiveness depends on how they are combined.
  Overall, our findings suggest that we can enhance the prevention of these unpleasant side effects by understanding patient’s individual risk factors and using a combination of medications targeting different factors contributing to PONV. These insights can help improve patient care by making recovery from surgery more comfortable and reducing the risk for complications.},

  abstract = {The presence of a hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease often presents with severe, disabling symptoms and is known to result into a poor quality-of-life for many patients. Nevertheless, it’s often seen by patients and physicians alike as an ailment to be treated by antacids, not as serious disease warranting surgery.  
  While most hiatal hernia are straightforward, in some rare cases the pancreas herniates along with the other organs into the thoracic cavity. Little is known about how to proceed surgically. Furthermore, some patients are hindered in their daily life by symptoms of delayed gastric emptying. Antireflux surgery is known to enhance gastric emptying speeds in most cases. Some patients, however, see their gastric emptying worsened. The mechanism behind this phenomenon remains mostly unclear.  
  When a hiatal hernia recurs or symptoms persist following primary antireflux surgery, a whole battery of diagnostic tests are done to find the mechanism of failure and therefore also the optimal mode of treatment. We hypothesize that computed tomography (CT) scanning of the gastroesphageal junction offers sufficient information to classify the underlying mechanism of failure.
  Current treatment of hiatal hernia is largely standardized in the Netherlands. Most centers perform partial laparoscopic fundoplications. Some centers, however, see benefits in using robotic assistance.  
  And finally, the question remains on how best to treat those patients with severe symptoms and poor quality-of-life following (multiple) previous failed antireflux surgeries and are currently left without any treatment options.  
  The aims of this thesis are to find out why the number of referrals for surgery remain lacking in the Netherlands, to describe our experience with intrathoracic herniation of the pancreas, to find the incidence of delayed gastric emptying in patients with large and small hiatal hernia, to describe the effects of surgery on gastric motility, to look at the value of CT-scanning in patients with recurrent disease, to look at the benefits of robotic assistance in primary and redo antireflux surgery, and to describe the development of a novel robot assisted transthoracic minimal-invasive approach for redo-antireflux surgery.},

  abstract = {The quality of care given by EMS staff is in part monitored by routine review of deployment reports that the providers must complete after each deployment. The assessment consists of determining whether a deployment was performed in a medically correct manner and thus whether the clinical reasoning process was appropriate. The time used during the deployment is also measured, as there are often time limits for performing different parts of the deployment and these must be adhered to. One might question whether measuring the time spent really gives insight into the quality of care, and if it might not be more useful to see how that time was spent. We therefore conceived a study to map the EMS care process and evaluate this process in relation to the time used. We used a focused ethnographic study design. Video recordings of EMS deployments in combination with semi-structured interviews of the EMS providers involved, were thematically analysed. This led to insights into the EMS care process and the embedded clinical reasoning. By categorising the professional activities we identified we were able to define a model that describes in general the EMS care process. We reported the first part of this study in which we developed this so called SPART model in a separate paper. In this second part of the study we determined the execution time within a deployment and measured the frequency of occurrence and the duration of the identified activities. We interpreted the operational content and the time variables both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also determined the distribution of activities over the three deployment operational periods (response, on-scene and transport period). Using the SPART model, we gained insight into the different activities' nature, order, and duration. We could qualitatively judge the effectiveness of the clinical reasoning process, i.e., the quality of care delivered. Generally, the studied cases were followable, and the clinical reasoning process was medically logical. The diagnostic process sometimes continued after the clinical decision, which was not medically logical. Remarkably, this never changed the clinical decision. Although this could negatively affect the quality of care, we found no clinical evidence that this was the case. Our findings demonstrated that the quality of care in EMS can be measured by using the SPART model to evaluate EMS deployments. We concluded that qualitative judgment was more important than quantitative evaluation. Interpreting the order of different activities led to the clearest understanding of the clinical reasoning process. It was concluded that knowledge of the exact time used per activity and, in total, had the least impact on understanding the clinical reasoning process.},

Thirty-six patients undergoing short lasting sedation following cardiac surgery were included to receive propofol to maintain a BIS between 40 and 60. Robustness of control for all groups was analysed using prediction error and spectrographic analysis. Although similar time courses of measured BIS were obtained in all groups, a higher median propofol effect-site concentration (CePROP) was required in the HUMAN group compared to the BAYES and EPSAC groups. The time course analysis of the remifentanil effect-site concentration (CeREMI) revealed a significant increase in CeREMI in the EPSAC group compared to BAYES and HUMAN during the case. Although similar bias and divergence in control was found in all groups, larger control inaccuracy was observed in HUMAN versus EPSAC and BAYES. Spectrographic analysis of the system behavior shows that BAYES covers the largest spectrum of frequencies, followed by EPSAC and HUMAN. Both computer-based control systems are feasible to be used during ICU sedation with overall tighter control than HUMAN and even with lower required CePROP. EPSAC control required higher CeREMI than BAYES or HUMAN to maintain stable control. Clinical trial number: NCT00735631.},

Forty-four quantitative time, frequency and entropy features were extracted from EEG recordings and were used to train the machine learning algorithms on sleep dataset to predict sleep stages in the sedation dataset. The predicted sleep states were then compared with the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation (MOAA/S) scores. The performance of the model was poor (AUC = 0.55-0.58) in differentiating sleep stages during propofol and sevoflurane sedation. In the case of dexmedetomidine, the AUC of the model increased in a sedation-dependent manner with NREM stages 2 and 3 highly correlating with deep sedation state reaching an AUC of 0.80. We addressed an important clinical question to identify biological sleep promoting sedatives using EEG signals. We demonstrate that propofol and sevoflurane do not promote EEG patterns resembling natural sleep while dexmedetomidine promotes states resembling NREM stages 2 and 3 sleep, based on current sleep staging standards.},

Secondary outcome was the incidence of postinduction hypotensive events. Mean (SD) percentage of time with Narcotrend Index values ≤ 60 during surgery across all patients receiving remimazolam (93% (20.7)) was non-inferior to propofol (99% (4.2)), mean difference (97.5%CI) -6.28% (-8.89-infinite); p = 0.003.

In conclusion, in patients who were ASA physical status 3 or 4, the anaesthetic effect of remimazolam was non-inferior to propofol.},

One option is to use anaesthetic gas capturing technology at anaesthesia workstation exhausts to harvest and recycle volatile agents. However, the efficiency of such technology is mainly unverified in vivo. The efficiency of CONTRAfluran™ in capturing sevoflurane from an anaesthesia workstation exhaust (when set to minimal flow and end-tidal control mode) was evaluated in 70 adult patients scheduled for general or bariatric laparoscopic surgery. The weight of the sevoflurane vaporiser and CONTRAfluran canister was measured before and after each case, to calculate total sevoflurane consumption and retention. Retention was measured after the minimal flow maintenance phase and after the high flow washout phase. The total retention efficiency was the fraction of all consumed sevoflurane captured by the CONTRAfluran canister. The primary objective was to examine the retention efficiency of CONTRAfluran in a clinical surgical setting, where all feasible strategies to minimise sevoflurane consumption and optimise the efficacy of CONTRAfluran were utilised. The secondary objective was to analyse the correlation between mass transfer and the duration of the case. Mean (SD) volume of sevoflurane captured using CONTRAfluran was 4.82 (1.41) ml, representing 45% (95%CI 42-48%) of all sevoflurane administered. The highest amount of retention was found during the washout phase. Retention efficiency did not correlate with the duration of the case. Over half of the sevoflurane administered was not captured by the CONTRAfluran canister when minimal flow techniques were used, likely due to residual accumulation of sevoflurane in the patient after tracheal extubation or, to a lesser extent, due to ventilation system leakage. However, as every prevented emission is commendable, CONTRAfluran may be a potentially valuable tool for reducing the environmental footprint of sevoflurane-based anaesthesia.},

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a daily prediction model for next-day disease severity in ICU patients. Data from the Simple Intensive Care Studies-II prospective cohort study of acutely admitted critically ill adults, including data collected during the first 7 days of admission such as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score-related measurements, were used to fit a mixed-effects logistic regression model for next-day deterioration. Deterioration was defined as a decline in the total (≥2) and organ-specific (≥1) SOFA scores. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. A total of 1009 patients were included. The final predictive model for overall next-day deterioration included six predictors (the total SOFA score on the current day, the minimum value of arterial pH, Glasgow Coma Scale score, mean arterial blood pressure, mechanical ventilation, and its effect differing between the first and subsequent ICU days). The model achieved an AUC of 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.78). In the decision curve analysis, within probability thresholds of 0.2-0.5, the model showed a higher net benefit than did strategies of treating all patients or treating no patients. Organ-specific prediction models for next-day deterioration in respiration, cardiovascular, and renal function showed slightly better performance than the overall model (AUCs: 0.79, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively). Daily prediction models can predict next-day disease severity in overall, respiration, cardiovascular, and renal function amongst ICU patients. They offer clinical benefits within a range of probability thresholds and could support decision-making for ICU physicians.},

Although the reasons may be many, the lack of a simplified algorithm for the assessment of DD specific to the perioperative arena, the implications of this diagnosis on clinical care, and the absence of therapeutic options are some of the commonly cited reasons. In this article, the authors address these possible reasons for the lack of routine application of Doppler indices to assess perioperative DD. The authors have chosen to highlight some of the most common conceptual questions, which often have been raised by anesthesiologists, and attempted to suggest answers. Drawing from their experience and data, the authors propose a simplified algorithm for the application of Doppler to assess and diagnose DD with an individualized and a mechanistic approach. The proposed algorithm is from within the premise of the published guidelines and attempts to simplify the perioperative approach. The authors hope this approach will be simple enough for routine application to affect therapy and a tangible change in outcome. The authors suggest that knowledge of left atrial size is valuable as a marker for persistently increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and its possible role in risk stratification.},

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol with sequential nerve blocks on pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain. As a first step a diagnostic, temporary celiac plexus block with local anesthetics was performed. If substantial pain relief was obtained, the assumption was that pain was relayed via the celiac plexus and major splanchnic nerves. When pain recurred, patients were then scheduled for a major splanchnic nerve block with radiofrequency ablation. In cases with no pain relief, it was assumed that pain was relayed via the aortico-renal plexus, and catheter-based renal denervation was performed. Sixty patients were referred, of which 44 were eligible. In 36 patients the diagnostic celiac plexus block resulted in substantial pain relief with a change in the median visual analogue scale (VAS) score pre-post intervention of 50/100. Of these patients, 23 received a major splanchnic nerve block because pain recurred, with a change in median VAS pre-post block of 53/100. In 8 patients without pain relief after the diagnostic block, renal denervation was performed in 5, with a borderline significant change in the median VAS pre-post intervention of 20/100. After a median follow-up of 12 months, 81.8% of the patients experienced a sustained improvement in pain intensity, indicating that our treatment protocol is effective in obtaining pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain.},

The expression of TGF-alpha, EGFr, p53 nuclear protein, and proliferation rate was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and survival after partial liver resection. In liver metastases, TGF-alpha expression was low in 42%, intermediate in 35%, and high in 23%. TGF-alpha expression was higher in liver metastases derived from lymph node-positive primary carcinomas, in synchronous and in irresectable liver metastases compared with those derived from lymph node-negative primary carcinomas, metachronous, and resectable liver metastases. Nuclear p53 expression was found in 83% of primary tumors and 71% of liver metastases. p53 expression did not correlate with the various clinicopathological characteristics. Ki67 expression was not associated with clinicopathological characteristics in primary and metastatic tumors. In the 38 patients in whom a partial liver resection was performed, median survival was 25 months in patients with a higher TGF-alpha expression in the metastasis than in the primary tumor and 60 months in patients with comparable or lower TGF-alpha expression in the metastasis than in the primary tumor (P = .036). Median survival after liver resection was 21 months in patients with p53-negative liver metastases and 58 months in patients with p53-positive metastases (P = .043). By multivariate analysis, p53 and EGFr expression on liver metastases were the best predictors of disease-free survival after partial liver resection, with relative risks of 2.38 and 3.33, respectively. In patients with colorectal liver metastases, referred for liver surgery, a higher TGF-alpha expression is associated with unfavorable tumor characteristics, whereas p53 and absence of EGFr expression is associated with a better survival after partial liver resection.},

We analyzed the long-term efficacy of our innovative multidisciplinary protocol to treat chronic refractory pain that aims to preserve kidney function by applying among other sequential nerve blocks. Patients were eligible if pain was present ≥3 months with a score of ≥50 on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100, was negatively affecting quality of life and if there had been insufficient response to previous therapies, including opioid treatment. Treatment options were, in order, analgesics, cyst aspiration and fenestration, nerve blocks and nephrectomy. A total of 101 patients were assessed in our clinic (mean age 50 ± 11 years, 65.3% females). Eight patients were treated with medication, 6 by cyst aspiration or fenestration, 63 by nerve blocks and 6 received surgery as the first treatment option. Overall, 76.9% experienced a positive effect on pain complaints shortly after treatment. The VAS score was reduced from 60/100 to 20/100 (P < 0.001) and patients decreased their number of nonopioid and opioid analgesics significantly (P < 0.001, P = 0.01, respectively). A substantial number of the patients (n = 51) needed additional treatment. At the end of follow-up in only 13 patients (12.9%) was surgical intervention necessary: 11 nephrectomies (of which 10 were in patients already on kidney function replacement treatment), 1 liver transplantation and 1 partial hepatectomy. After a median follow-up of 4.5 years (interquartile range 2.5-5.3), 69.0% of the patients still had fewer pain complaints. These data indicate that our multidisciplinary treatment protocol appears effective in reducing pain in the majority of patients with chronic refractory pain, while postponing or even avoiding in most patients surgical interventions such as nephrectomy in most patients.},

During the initial visit (T0), demographic variables, pain intensity, knowledge of the prescription (name, dose, and frequency), self-reported adherence to the prescription, and general knowledge of pharmacological pain therapy (according to the Pain Knowledge Questionnaire, Dutch Language Version (PKQ-DLV) were recorded. During two follow-up visits (T1, T2), apart from demographics, these parameters were measured again. Adherence rates were 42%, 42%, and 46% at T0, T1 and T2, respectively. 53%, 59%, and 48% of patients had knowledge of their current prescription, and mean scores on the PKQ-DLV were 56, 55, and 52 percent of the maximum scores, respectively, at T0, T1 and T2. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis resulted in a significant contribution of knowledge of the prescription and of age to the prediction of adherence. Knowledge of the analgesic prescription is associated with adherence and significantly contributes to the prediction of adherence to analgesic therapy. An interventional study is needed to determine whether increasing knowledge will improve medication adherence and therapy outcome in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain.},

To develop this protocol with optimized acquisition and processing parameters, we initially aggregated 65 functional imaging datasets acquired from rats across 46 centers. We developed a reproducible pipeline for analyzing rat data acquired with diverse protocols and determined experimental and processing parameters associated with the robust detection of functional connectivity across centers. We show that the standardized protocol enhances biologically plausible functional connectivity patterns relative to previous acquisitions. The protocol and processing pipeline described here is openly shared with the neuroimaging community to promote interoperability and cooperation toward tackling the most important challenges in neuroscience.},

The RIA was positive in 33 of 41 (82.9%) patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) and in 51 of 79 (64.4%) patients with secondary thrombocytopenia (STP). The PIFT was positive in 37 of the 41 (90.2%) ITP patients and in 57 of the 79 (72.2%) STP patients. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ITP of both tests were comparable: 82.9 and 40.9% for the PA-IgG(RIA) and 90.2 and 36.7% for the PIFT. A significant positive correlation was observed between the mean amount of PA-IgG measured and the height of PIFT scores with anti-IgG. Of 38 discrepancies between PA-IgG(RIA) and PIFT with anti-IgG, 15 were due to borderline results, 17 were associated with abnormal platelet-size distribution and 20 were associated with occurrence of IgM antibodies. These results suggest influences of platelet fragments and/or aggregates on accurate measurement of PA-IgG. Both fragments and aggregates escape from accurate platelet counting, while their contribution to the total IgG content remains. Therefore, a falsely elevated PA-IgG (RIA) may be measured.},

This review is intended to provide a critical analysis of the available evidence concerning the indications for clinical measurement of indocyanine green elimination as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in two areas: its role in peri-operative liver function monitoring during major hepatic resection and liver transplantation; and its role in critically ill patients on the intensive care unit, where it is used for prediction of mortality, and for assessment of the severity of acute liver failure or that of intra-abdominal hypertension. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that indocyanine green elimination measurements in these patient populations can provide diagnostic or prognostic information to the clinician, 'hard' evidence - i.e. high-quality prospective randomised controlled trials - is lacking, and therefore it is not yet time to give a green light for use of indocyanine green in routine clinical practice.},

In contrast, the Nexfin(®) device provides continuous non-invasive measurement of MAP (MAPcNIAP) using a finger cuff. We explored the agreement of MAPcNIAP and MAPiNIAP with the gold standard: continuous invasive MAP measurement by placement of a radial artery catheter (MAPinvasive). In a total of 120 patients undergoing elective general surgery and clinically requiring MAPinvasive measurement, MAPiNIAP and MAPcNIAP were measured in a 30 min time period at an arbitrary moment during surgery with stable haemodynamics. MAPiNIAP was measured every 5 min. Data from 112 patients were analysed. Compared with MAPinvasive, modified Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias (sd) of 2 (9) mm Hg for MAPcNIAP and -2 (12) mm Hg for MAPiNIAP. Percentage errors for MAPcNIAP and MAPiNIAP were 22% and 32%, respectively. In a haemodynamically stable phase in patients undergoing general anaesthesia, the agreement with invasive MAP of continuous non-invasive measurement using a finger cuff was not inferior to the agreement of intermittent arm cuff oscillometry. Continuous measurements using a finger cuff can interchangeably be used as an alternative for intermittent arm cuff oscillometry in haemodynamically stable patients, with the advantage of beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring.

  abstract = {1. Many poultry houses are illuminated by fluorescent lamps which produce discontinuous illumination with a frequency of either 100 or 120 Hz. 2. This study investigated whether domestic fowls perceive this discontinuity as flicker by training two Leghorn hens to choose between a continuous and a discontinuous light, all other variables being identical. 3. The light-stimulus was either monochromatic with 100% sinusoidal modulation or a fluorescent lamp whose modulation frequency could be electrically adjusted. 4. Each (correct) choice for the discontinuous light was followed by a 5 Hz higher frequency, whereas an incorrect choice was followed by a 10 Hz lower frequency. 5. On the basis of this principle the animals themselves established the highest perceivable frequency of the discontinuous light, called the Critical Fusion Frequency (CFF), that they could discriminate from continuous light. 6. These frequencies typically depend on the stimulus intensity increasing with increasing intensities, until a maximum value is reached. 7. Two factors limited the magnitudes of the CFF's that were recorded: the maximum stimulus intensities produced and variability in the chicken's response ("behavioural noise"). In spite of these constraints 105 Hz was established as the maximum CFF. 8. On the basis of extrapolation it is concluded that the direct light from fluorescent lamps driven by 50 Hz alternating current is seen by the chicken as flickering. 9. The results justify large-scale comparison of behaviour and production in poultry houses that are illuminated either by low-frequency or by high-frequency fluorescent lamps.},

Retrospective observational study. Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands, over a 14-year period from January 2005 to December 2018. The study included 99 consecutive patients with simple dextro-transposition of the great arteries with or without a ventricular septal defect. All patients received preoperative management including intravenous prostaglandin E1 and, when necessary, a balloon atrial septostomy. Patients were then scheduled for an arterial switch operation. Patients were divided into a PPHN and a non-PPHN group. The outcomes assessed included mortality (overall, preoperative, 30-day postoperative and late mortality) and postoperative morbidity (length of ventilatory support, intensive care unit and hospital stay, delayed sternal closure and resternotomy). PPHN was present in 31% of patients. Overall mortality was 8.1%, with no difference between PPHN and non-PPHN patients (9.7 v 7.4%, p = 0.70). PPHN had no effect on morbidity outcomes. A lower weight at birth was associated with preoperative mortality. Duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative hypotension were associated with longer intensive care unit stay. Intraoperative hypotension and cerebral oxygen desaturation had no significant impact on mortality. PPHN did not significantly affect perioperative morbidity and mortality in d-TGA patients, suggesting a more favorable prognosis than previously reported.},

  abstract = {Two centuries ago, Goethe wrote in his Farbenlehre about blue as a receding colour, against yellow/red as a colour 'piercing into the organ'. Though any verification of these psychological attributes seems to be absent, this depth effect in colour still seems to be taken for granted in art history. In visual science, the completely different and far better documented colour stereoscopic effect, known as chromostereopsis, prevails. A historical account is given of the development of ideas about this chromostereopsis, often by amusing trials and errors. The original explanation by Bruecke in terms of chromatic aberration (in present-day literature usually indicated as transverse chromatic aberration) and a temporal off-axis position of the fovea still forms the basis of present-day understanding, even though Bruecke rejected his own explanation. It had to be complemented by an additional off-axis effect of the pupil, not in an anatomical sense, as Einthoven presumed but failed to find but in a functional sense by a non-centric Stiles-Crawford effect. Although a comprehensive individual experimental proof is still missing, the evidence available indicates that a satisfactory quantitative explanation has been reached.},

The association of compliance with perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols and postoperative outcomes is unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of protocol compliance on postoperative outcomes following high-risk surgery, after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol. Through a before-after study design, patients undergoing elective high-risk surgery before (before-group) and after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol (after-group) were included. Perioperative goal-directed therapy in the after-group consisted of optimized stroke volume variation or stroke volume index and optimized cardiac index. Additionally, the association of protocol compliance with postoperative complications when using perioperative goal-directed therapy was assessed. High protocol compliance was defined as ≥ 85% of the procedure time spent within the individual targets. The difference in complications during the first 30 postoperative days before and after implementation of the protocol was assessed. In the before-group, 214 patients were included and 193 patients in the after-group. The number of complications was higher in the before-group compared to the after-group (n = 414 vs. 282; p = 0.031). In the after-group, patients with high protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index had less complications compared to patients with low protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index (n = 187 vs. 90; p = 0.01). Protocol compliance by the attending clinicians is essential and should be monitored to facilitate an improvement in postoperative outcomes desired by the implementation of perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols.},

We compared the ability of APW-based variations in stroke volume (SVV) and pulse pressure (PPV) and of PW-based plethysmographic variability index (PVI) to predict fluid responsiveness and to track fluid changes in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Furthermore, we assessed whether the PPV/SVV ratio, as a measure of dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn), could predict a reduction in norepinephrine requirement after fluid administration. Thirty patients received i.v. fluid (15 ml kg(-1) in 30 min) after hepatic resection and were considered responders when stroke volume index (SVI) increased ≥20% after fluid administration. SVV and SVI were measured by the FloTrac-Vigileo(®) device, and PVI was measured by the Masimo Radical 7 pulse co-oximeter(®). The areas under a receiver operating characteristic curve for SVV, PPV, and PVI were 0.81, 0.77, and 0.78, respectively. In responders, all dynamic variables, except PVI, decreased after fluid administration. Eadyn predicted a reduced norepinephrine requirement (AUC = 0.81). In patients undergoing major hepatic resection, both APW- and PW-based dynamic preload variables predict fluid responsiveness (preload) to a similar extent. Most variables (except PVI) also tracked fluid changes. Eadyn, as a measure of arterial elastance (afterload), might be helpful to distinguish the origin of hypotension.

  abstract = {Thermal cataract has long been known as an occupational disease in furnace workers. This affliction has virtually disappeared in western countries due to improved working conditions. However, new light sources have appeared on the scene, in particular lasers, which might also be capable of producing thermal cataract. The aim of this survey is to review the history and describe the present state of knowledge. Experimental work, mainly on rabbits, was reviewed and complemented with the results of calculations on the thermal changes in the ocular media. Safe exposure limits were derived over the optical spectrum from the near ultraviolet to the far infrared. Lasers may be a cause of thermal cataract only in the near ultraviolet. Moreover, in this field of research too, it is concluded that science may be regarded as the present state of misunderstanding.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis characterises the existing efficacy and safety data of PCC use in LT. This review was registered (PROSPERO CRD#42024561866). MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to 30 May 2024. Studies in adults undergoing LT where PCC exposure was reported in relation to clinical outcomes were included. Random effects models were used to obtain pooled effect estimates. All studies were retrospective, with seven reporting the number of patients receiving PCC [392/1901 (21%)], and one grouping patients receiving different factor concentrates together [576/939 (61%)]. Patients receiving PCC had worse preoperative coagulopathy, model for end-stage liver disease scores, and comorbidities. Patients exposed to PCC had a comparable mean number of red blood cell (RBC), plasma, or platelet units transfused. Use of viscoelastic testing-based algorithms incorporating PCC compared with usual care was associated with reduced odds of RBC exposure (odds ratio [OR]: 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-0.86, I Although there are no randomised trials comparing use of PCC vs FP in LT, their efficacy and safety appear comparable. Higher-quality studies are needed to assess PCC use for coagulopathic bleeding in LT.},

We recommend basing intra-operative arterial pressure management on mean arterial pressure and keeping intra-operative mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg. We further recommend identifying the underlying causes of intra-operative hypotension and addressing them appropriately. We suggest pragmatically treating bradycardia or tachycardia when it leads to profound hypotension or likely results in reduced cardiac output, oxygen delivery or organ perfusion. We suggest monitoring stroke volume or cardiac output in patients with high baseline risk for complications or in patients having high-risk surgery to assess the haemodynamic status and the haemodynamic response to therapeutic interventions. However, we recommend not routinely maximising stroke volume or cardiac output in patients having noncardiac surgery. Instead, we suggest defining stroke volume and cardiac output targets individually for each patient considering the clinical situation and clinical and metabolic signs of tissue perfusion and oxygenation. We recommend not giving fluids simply because a patient is fluid responsive but only if there are clinical or metabolic signs of hypovolaemia or tissue hypoperfusion. We suggest monitoring and optimising the depth of anaesthesia to titrate doses of anaesthetic drugs and reduce their side effects.},

Patients with critical limb ischemia are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events and subsequent cardiovascular death. Little is known about the incidence and consequences of these adverse events. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adverse cardiac events on mortality in patients with critical limb ischemia undergoing surgical or endovascular treatment. A retrospective cohort study including all patients with critical limb ischemia aged ≥65 undergoing surgical or endovascular treatment for critical limb ischemia between January 2013 and June 2018 was conducted. Data on adverse cardiac events were collected from medical records. The effect of an adverse cardiac event on mortality during 6 months follow-up was analyzed with a multivariable cox proportional hazards model to adjust for confounders. Effects are displayed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total number of 449 patients were included. Median age was 76 years, 52.8% of patients were male. In total, 51 patients (11%) developed an adverse cardiac event, 31 patients (10%) in the surgical group and 20 patients (14%) in the endovascular group. After adjustment for confounders, adverse cardiac events were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 3.5 95% CI 2.1-5.9). This study showed that adverse cardiac events commonly occur in elderly patients with critical limb ischemia. Adverse cardiac events continue to occur even months after treatment and are associated with an increased mortality risk. These findings justify routine cardiac evaluation in both surgical and endovascular treatment. Additionally, frequent postdischarge cardiac follow-up in the outpatient clinic may be helpful in limiting the occurrence of adverse cardiac events.},

  abstract = {Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) very commonly accompanies general anaesthesia in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. The development of IOH is unwanted, since it is associated with adverse outcomes such as acute kidney injury and myocardial injury, stroke and mortality. Although the definition of IOH is variable, harm starts to occur below a mean arterial pressure (MAP) threshold of 65 mmHg. The odds of adverse outcome increase for increasing duration and/or magnitude of IOH below this threshold, and even short periods of IOH seem to be associated with adverse outcomes. Therefore, reducing the hypotensive burden by predicting and preventing IOH through proactive appropriate treatment may potentially improve patient outcome. In this review article, we summarise the current state of the prediction of IOH by the use of so-called machine-learning algorithms. Machine-learning algorithms that use high-fidelity data from the arterial pressure waveform, may be used to reveal 'traits' that are unseen by the human eye and are associated with the later development of IOH. These algorithms can use large datasets for 'training', and can subsequently be used by clinicians for haemodynamic monitoring and guiding therapy. A first clinically available application, the hypotension prediction index (HPI), is aimed to predict an impending hypotensive event, and additionally, to guide appropriate treatment by calculated secondary variables to asses preload (dynamic preload variables), contractility (dP/dt},

A comparison is made of these guidelines, embedded in a short sketch of the history. They are illustrated by examples of applications. In most cases the HCN guidelines produce results that hardly deviate from those obtained with the ACGIH guidelines but in some cases the results diverge and in other cases HCN gives an answer where ACGIH seems to fall short.

Therefore, we evaluated whether induced hypo- and hypervolaemia result in changes in central blood volumes (pulmonary blood volume (PBV), intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV)) and we explored the effects on the distribution between these central blood volumes and circulating blood volume (Vd circ). Six anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing Foxhound dogs underwent random blood volume alterations in steps of 150 ml (mild) to 450 ml (moderate), either by haemorrhage, retransfusion of blood, or colloid infusion. PBV, ITBV and Vd circ were measured using (transpulmonary) dye dilution. The PBV/Vd circ ratio and the ITBV/Vd circ ratio were used as an assessment of blood volume distribution. 68 blood volume alterations resulted in changes in Vdcirc ranging from -33 to +31%. PBV and ITBV decreased during mild and moderate haemorrhage, while during retransfusion, PBV and ITBV increased during moderate hypervolaemia only. The PBV/Vd circ ratio remained constant during all stages of hypo- and hypervolaemia (mean values between 0.20-0.22). This was also true for the ITBV/Vd circ ratio, which remained between 0.31 and 0.32, except for moderate hypervolaemia, where it increased slightly to 0.33 (0.02), P<0.05. Mild to moderate blood volume alterations result in changes of Vd circ, PBV and ITBV. The ratio between the central blood volumes and Vd circ generally remained unaltered. Therefore, it could be suggested that in anaesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs, the cardiovascular system maintains the distribution of blood between central and circulating blood volume.},

MAP, HR, SV, CI, SctO2, SptO2 and rate-pressure product (RPP) analysed from 30 s before drug administration until 240 s thereafter. Phenylephrine and norepinephrine caused an equivalent increase in MAP [Δ = 13 (8 to 22) and Δ = 13 (9 to 19) mmHg, respectively] and SV [Δ = 6 ± 6 and Δ = 5 ± 7 ml, respectively], combined with a significant equivalent decrease in HR (both Δ = -8 ± 6 bpm), CI (both Δ = -0.2 ± 0.3 l min(-1) m(-2)) and SctO2 and an unchanged RPP (Δ = 345 ± 876 and Δ = 537 ± 1076 mmHg min(-1)).

The primary absorber is melanin. Photochemical damage occurs at body temperature and involves cellular damage by reactive forms of oxygen. The photosensitizers are photoproducts of the visual pigments. First indications that non-thermal damage might exist, in particular in the case of eclipse blindness, was presented by Vos in 1962. Attribution thereof to photochemical action was presented in 1966 by Noell et al who also measured the first action spectrum, in rat. It turned out to be identical to the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin. However, in 1976 and 1982 Ham et al found a quite different spectrum in monkeys, peaking at short wavelengths. The latter spectrum, but not the former, was confirmed since in numerous publications with animal models including rat. In ophthalmological practice a 'sunburn' was at first the only complaint caused by light damage. To avoid this, patients with dilated pupils should always be advised to wear sunglasses. Since the invention of the laser accidents have been reported, the most recent development is youth playfully pointing a strong laser pen in their eyes with marked consequences. The operation microscope and endoilluminators should always be used as brief as possible to avoid photochemical damage. Arguments for implant lenses that block not only the UV but also part of the visible spectrum seem too weak to justify extra costs.},

The amount of PA-IgG of washed, unfixed normal donor platelets was 1.0 +/- 0.9 fg IgG/platelet (mean +/- 2 SD). Upon storage of washed platelets in a buffer containing EDTA, the amount decreased significantly to 0.2 +/- 0.2 fg IgG/platelet. Simultaneously, an increase in modal platelet volume was observed. Similar results were obtained when platelets were fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA). We postulate that this decrease in PA-IgG is caused by the release of plasma IgG entrapped by the surface-connected canicular system of the platelet, when the platelets swell during storage in EDTA or fixation with PFA. This presence of varying amounts of entrapped plasma IgG may cause the wide discrepancies in PA-IgG found in normal donor platelets as well as platelets from ITP patients by other investigators. A good quantification of platelet-bound alloantibodies was possible with our assay when platelets were routinely fixed to diminish the amount of nonspecific PA-IgG. This was demonstrated with different anti-Zwa (= anti-PlA1), anti-Baka and anti-HLA sera. We also observed that fragments of platelets as well as fragments of cells of other types can cause aspecifically increased Pa-IgG values and can thus interfere with the proper measurement of platelet-bound antibodies in all kinds of immunoassays in general.},

  abstract = {Ensuring and maintaining adequate tissue oxygenation at the microcirculatory level might be considered the holy grail of optimal hemodynamic patient management. However, in clinical practice we usually focus on macro-hemodynamic variables such as blood pressure, heart rate, and sometimes cardiac output. Other macro-hemodynamic variables like pulse pressure or stroke volume variation are additionally used as markers of fluid responsiveness. In recent years, an increasing number of technological devices assessing tissue oxygenation or microcirculatory blood flow have been developed and validated, and some of them have already been incorporated into clinical practice. In this review, we will summarize recent research findings on this topic as published in the last 2 years in the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing (JCMC). While some techniques are already currently used as routine monitoring (e.g. cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)), others still have to find their way into clinical practice. Therefore, further research is needed, particularly regarding outcome measures and cost-effectiveness, since introducing new technology is always expensive and should be balanced by downstream savings. The JCMC is glad to provide a platform for such research.},

When all three tests were considered, positive results were obtained for 92.0% of the ITP patients with a platelet count of less than 150 X 10(9)/l and for 98.4% of the patients with a count of less than 100 X 10(9)/l. However, for many patients rather weak test results were obtained, with a score of 1/2-1 in 59.8% of the patients. Most patients (94.1%) with a positive direct test had a positive indirect test on the eluate. Thus, platelet-bound antibodies but not platelet-bound immune complexes were present in most, if not all, patients. Positive immunofluorescence tests were obtained for many patients with a diagnosis other than ITP. This resulted in a low specificity of the test for the diagnosis of ITP, evidently because autoimmune thrombocytopenia occurred together with many other diseases and also because antibodies against platelet cryptantigens (expressed by the action of EDTA or by platelet fixation) were present in many patients.},

The majority of these papers investigated the use of either cerebral or peripheral tissue oxygen saturation, derived non-invasively using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In some of these studies, the microcirculation was "provocated" by inducing short-term tissue hypoxia, allowing the assessment of functional microvascular reserve. Additionally, studies on technical differences between NIRS monitors are summarized, as well as studies investigating the feasibility of NIRS monitoring, mainly in the pediatric patient population. Last but not least, novel monitoring tools allow assessing oxygenation at a (sub)cellular level, and those papers incorporating these techniques are also reviewed here.},

Structured interviews (n = 27) and questionnaires (n = 84) were conducted to explore clinicians' beliefs and barriers to IOH treatment, in addition to usefulness of HPI questionnaires (n = 14). 150 elective major surgical patients who required invasive blood pressure monitoring were included in three cohorts to assess incidence and time-weighted average (TWA) of hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg).

  abstract = {In the 1920s and 1930s, disability glare was a topic of great interest in the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE). The Second World War prevented agreement being reached on a standard to quantify disability glare but the Stiles-Holladay formula was widely accepted as such. In 1983, CIE started a new effort to develop a CIE standard making use of research data published in the post-war years. A committee was formed that agreed that new data and insights justified an extension of the angular domain of a disability glare formula and allowed introduction of an age factor and allowance for ocular pigmentation. Three disability glare equations were formulated, each for an appropriately restricted angular domain. The most general, the CIE General Disability Glare equation, covers the full angular range between 0.1 degrees and 100 degrees but for optometrists the CIE Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay Disability Glare equation, with validity domain between one degree and 30 degrees, will often suffice. Disability glare is due to intraocular scatter and obeys, in the one-degree to 30-degree angular domain, albeit with great individual spread, the Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay equation: (L(veil) /E(glare))(Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay) = 10 (1 + [Age/70](4)).1/theta(2). Quantitative examples are given of the manifestation of disability glare, particularly in traffic.},

Thirty patients undergoing major hepatic resection were included and randomized to receive a fluid bolus of 15 ml kg(-1) colloid (n=15) or crystalloid (n=15) solution over 30 min. SpHb was continuously measured on the index finger, and venous blood samples were analysed in both the steady-state phase (from induction until completion of parenchymal transection) and the dynamic phase (during fluid bolus). Correlation was significant between SpHb and Hb(satlab) (R(2)=0.50, n=543). The modified Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements showed a bias (precision) of -0.27 (1.06) and -0.02 (1.07) g dl(-1) for the steady-state and dynamic phases, respectively. SpHb accuracy increased when Hb(satlab) was <10 g dl(-1), with a bias (precision) of 0.41 (0.47) vs -0.26 (1.12) g dl(-1) for values >10 g dl(-1), but accuracy decreased after colloid administration (R(2)=0.25). SpHb correlated moderately with Hb(satlab) with a slight underestimation in both phases in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Accuracy increased for lower Hb(satlab) values but decreased in the presence of colloid solution. Further improvements are necessary to improve device accuracy under these conditions, so that SpHb might become a sensitive screening device for clinically significant anaemia.},

In this prospective validation intervention study, 20 healthy volunteers were breathing standardized oxygen concentrations ranging from mild hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.14) to hyperoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 1.0) via a tight-fitting face mask. ORi was measured noninvasively by multiwavelength pulse co-oximetry using 2 finger sensors. These ORi values (unitless scale, 0.00-1.00) were compared with measured PaO2 values. Repeated-measurements correlation analysis was performed to assess the ORi/PaO2 relationship. ORi trending ability was assessed using a 4-quadrant plot. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to assess the prediction of hypoxia (low-ranged PaO2, <100 mm Hg). Within the ORi-sensitive range, a strong positive correlation was found between ORi and PaO2 for both sensors (R = 0.78 and 0.83; P < .0001). ORi trending of PaO2 was good within this range (concordance rate = 94%). The prediction of PaO2 <100 mm Hg was also good, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.91 and 99% sensitivity and 82% specificity. In this prospective volunteer validation study, a strong and positive correlation between PaO2 and ORi was found, together with a good trending ability. Based on these data, the future use of ORi as a continuous noninvasive monitoring tool for assessing oxygenation status in patients receiving supplemental oxygen might be supported.},

PDRICG was measured non-invasively by pulse dye densitometry during surgery and was correlated with initial graft function. At the end of surgery, PDRICG was higher in patients without complications: 24.9 % min(-1) (n = 40) versus 21.0 % min(-1), (n = 22; p = 0.034). An area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for PDRICG was 0.70, while the AUROC for pH, lactate and PT at ICU admission were 0.53, 0.50 and 0.46, respectively. The AUROC of serum bilirubin and PT at postoperative day 5 were 0.68 and 0.49, respectively.

There is a need for perioperative treatment protocols aiming at improving tissue oxygenation (StO2).

Furthermore, we evaluated the feasibility of the optimisation algorithm used. We randomized 50 high-risk patients, all >65 years with ASA physical status III, who underwent major abdominal surgery under standardized balanced general anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia. Throughout surgery StO2 was monitored at the thenar eminence using near-infrared spectroscopy. All patients were treated according to a standard care algorithm. In addition, patients in the intervention group were treated with dobutamine if necessary to keep or raise StO2 ≥ 80%. Data were recorded continuously and complications were recorded during hospital stay with a maximum of 28 days. The number of complications was not significantly different between groups (11 vs 20; p = 0.23). Eleven patients in the intervention group had no complication, versus 7 in the control group. There was no significant difference between groups in length of stay in ICU or in hospital. Only ten patients in the intervention group received dobutamine. Administration of dobutamine resulted in a moderate 6 [-3 to 10] % increase of StO2. The overall protocol adherence was 94%. No statistically significant difference in outcome was realized through intraoperative optimization of StO2 values in this pilot study. The protocol used may be considered feasible for clinical practice. Further research is obligatory to define both the optimal StO2 threshold and intervention to treat tissue hypoperfusion.

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model for mitral annular dilatation simulation and determine its effects on the individualized mitral valve (MV) coaptation reserve index (CRI). A retrospective analysis of intraoperative transesophageal 3-dimensionalechocardiographic MV datasets was performed. A mathematical model was created to assess the mitral CRI for each leaflet segment (A1-P1, A2-P2, A3-P3). Mitral CRI was defined as the ratio between the coaptation reserve (measured coaptation length along the closure line) and an individualized correction factor. Indexing was chosen to correct for MV sphericity and area of largest valve opening. Mathematical models were created to simulate progressive mitral annular dilatation and to predict the effect on the individual mitral CRI. At a single-center academic hospital. Twenty-five patients with normally functioning MVs undergoing cardiac surgery. None. Direct measurement of leaflet coaptation along the closure line showed the lowest amount of coaptation (reserve) near the commissures (A1-P1 0.21 ± 0.05 cm and A3-P3 0.22 ± 0.06 cm), and the highest amount of coaptation (reserve) at region A2 to P2 0.25 ± 0.06 cm. After indexing, the A2-to-P2 region was the area with the lowest CRI in the majority of patients, and also the area with the least resistance to mitral regurgitation (MR) occurrence after simulation of progressive annular dilation. Quantification and indexing of mitral coaptation reserve along the closure line are feasible. Indexing and mathematical simulation of progressive annular dilatation consistently showed that indexed coaptation reserve was lowest in the A2-to-P2 region. These results may explain why this area is prone to lose coaptation and is often affected in MR.},

The interest in using minimally invasive cardiac output monitors is growing. The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available devices to provide an overview of their validation studies in order to answer the question whether these devices are ready for implementation in clinical practice. Current evidence shows that minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring devices are not yet interchangeable with (trans)pulmonary thermodilution in measuring cardiac output. However, validation studies are generally single centre, are based on small sample sizes in heterogeneous groups, and differ in the statistical methods used. Minimally and noninvasive monitoring devices may not be sufficiently accurate to replace (trans)pulmonary thermodilution in estimating cardiac output. The current paradigm shift to explore trending ability rather than investigating agreement of absolute values alone is to be applauded. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of these devices in the context of (functional) haemodynamic monitoring before adoption into clinical practice can be recommended.},

Few studies have examined the effectiveness of predicting FR according to the definition of FR, and assessment of inconclusive values of PPV and SVV around the cut-off value (the "grey zone") might improve individual FR prediction. We explored the ability of noninvasive volume clamp derived measurements of PPV and SVV to predict FR using the grey zone approach, and we assessed the influence of multiple thresholds on the predictive ability of the numerical definition of FR. Ninety patients undergoing general surgery were included in this prospective observational study and received a 500 mL fluid bolus as deemed clinically required by the attending anesthesiologist. A minimal relative increase in stroke volume index (↑SVI) was used to define FR with different thresholds from 10-25%. The PPV, SVV, and SVI were measured using the Nexfin® device that employs noninvasive volume clamp plethysmography. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve gradually increased for PPV / SVV with higher threshold values (from 0.818 / 0.760 at 10% ↑SVI to 0.928 / 0.944 at 25% ↑SVI). The grey zone limits of both PPV and SVV changed from 9-16% (PPV) and 5-13% (SVV) at the 10% ↑SVI threshold to 18-21% (PPV) and 14-16% (SVV) at the 25% ↑SVI threshold. Noninvasive PPV and SVV measurements allow an acceptable FR prediction, although the reliability of both variables is dependent on the intended increase in SVI, which improves substantially with concomitant smaller grey zones at higher ↑SVI thresholds.},

We aimed to assess agreement of somatic and renal near-infrared spectroscopy with reference blood samples. O3 sensors were placed bilaterally on the quadriceps and flank of 26 healthy volunteers. A stepped, controlled hypoxia sequence was performed by adding a mixture of nitrogen and room air to the breathing circuit. O3-derived oxygen saturation values were obtained at baseline and at six decremental saturation levels (5% steps). Blood samples (radial artery, iliac vein (somatic reference) and renal vein) were obtained at each step. Reference values were calculated as: 0.7 × venous saturation + 0.3 × arterial saturation. The agreement between O3-derived values with blood reference values was assessed by calculating root-mean-square error accuracy and Bland-Altman plots. The root-mean-square error accuracy was 6.0% between quadriceps oxygen saturation and somatic reference values. The mean bias was 0.8%, with limits of agreement from -7.7 to 9.3%. These were 5.1% and 0.6% (-8.3 to 9.5%) for flank oxygen saturation and somatic reference values, respectively, and 7.7% and -4.9% (-15.0 to 5.2%) for flank oxygen saturation and renal reference values. The kidney depth was 3.1 ± 0.9 cm below the skin. O3 regional oximetry can be used on the quadriceps and flank to monitor somatic saturation, yet has a saturation-level dependent bias. O3-derived values obtained at the flank underestimated renal reference values. Additionally, it is unlikely that the flank sensors did directly measure renal tissue.

To reduce the risk, blood pressure is closely measured during general anesthesia, and norepinephrine (NE) is frequently administered if hypotension is detected. Despite its routine application, information on the dose-exposure-response relationship of NE remains limited. Additionally, quantification of the influence of general anesthesia on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of NE is lacking. In this study, we aimed to describe NE PK in healthy volunteers and the influence of general anesthesia on its PK. A single-center, cross-over study was conducted in healthy volunteers. The volunteers received a step-up NE dosing scheme (0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16 and 0.20 mcg A total of 1219 samples were analyzed from 36 volunteers. A two-compartment model with a first-order elimination best described the data. Weight, age, and session effect (awake vs general anesthesia) were identified as relevant covariates on the clearance (CL) of NE. A 10% decrease in NE CL was observed after general anesthesia induction. This difference between sessions is better explained by the measured concentration of propofol, rather than the anticipated impact of cardiac output. The estimated post-stimulation NE concentration is 0.66 nmol/L The NE PK is well described with a two-compartment model with a first-order elimination. NE CL exhibiting a 10% decrease under general anesthesia, with this difference being attributed to the measured concentration of propofol.

In addition, optimal surgical conditions and safe and fast emergence are pivotal parts of anesthetic management. In high-antinociceptive propofol/remifentanil anesthesia with bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 60, norepinephrine was administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 80% of individual baseline. Fluid was administered if the ∆ plethysmographic waveform amplitude exceeded 10%. Surgical and recovery conditions, hemodynamic responses, and tissue oxygenation were investigated. Mean (SD) StO2 at the left thenar eminence increased from 83 (6)% before to 86 (4)% 20 min after induction of anesthesia (p <0.05). Cardiac index dropped from 3.0 (0.7) to 2.1 (0.4) L min(-1) (p <0.05), MAP from 109 (16) to 83 (14) mm Hg, and heart rate from 73 (12) to 54 (8) bpm (p <0.05). Thirteen out of 40 patients received a fluid bolus. The median (range) norepinephrine administration rate was 0.05 (0.0-0.10) μg kg(-1) min(-1).

To determine the feasibility, reproducibility and validity of the Shuttle Test (ST) to measure exercise capacity in people with stroke. Longitudinal study design. Rehabilitation department, day care centres from a nursing home and private practices specialized in neuro rehabilitation. People with subacute or chronic stroke. A standardized protocol was used to determine feasibility, reproducibility and validity of the 10-meter Shuttle Test (10mST). Number of shuttles completed, 1stVentilatory Threshold (1stVT). The associations of the number of shuttles completed and cardiopulmonary capacity as measured with a portable gas analyser were r > 0.7, confirming good convergent validity in subacute and chronic people with stroke. Criterion validity, however, indicates it is not a valid test for measuring maximal cardiopulmonary capacity (VO2max). Only 60% of participants were able to reach the 1stVT. Higher cardiopulmonary capacity and a higher total score of the lower extremity Motricity Index contributed significantly to a higher number of shuttles walked (p = 0.001). The Shuttle Test may be a safe and useful exercise test for people after stroke, but may not be appropriate for use with people who walk slower than 2 km/h or 0.56 m/s.},

The micro-fluid challenge (micro-FC; rapid central infusion of 50 ml) and the extrasystolic method utilising post-extrasystolic preload increases may predict fluid responsiveness. Two study windows during coronary artery bypass graft surgery were defined, 1: After anaesthesia induction until surgical incision, 2: Left internal mammarian artery surgical preparation period. Each window consisted of 10-15 min observation for extrasystoles before a micro-FC was performed, after which a traditional fluid challenge (FC) was performed (5 ml/kg). Extrasystolic and micro-FC induced changes in hemodynamic variables were derived as predictors of fluid responsiveness defined as stroke volume increasing > 10% following FC. 61 patients were studied. Post-ectopic changes in pulse pressure (PP) predicted fluid responsiveness with receiver operating characteristic area (AUC) of 0.69 [CI 0.40;0.97] in the first study window and 0.64 [0.44;0.86] in the second window. Other post-ectopic predictors such as pre-ejection period (PEP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) had similar or lower AUCs. Heart rate was 52.9 (SD ±8.4) min},

  abstract = {The exact onset of brain injury in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. Our aim was, therefore, to assess the association between prenatal Doppler flow patterns, postnatal cerebral oxygenation and short-term neurological outcome. Prenatally, we measured pulsatility indices of the middle cerebral (MCA-PI) and umbilical artery (UA-PI) and calculated cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). After birth, cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) were assessed during the first 3 days after birth, and during and for 24 hours after every surgical procedure within the first 3 months after birth. Neurological outcome was determined preoperatively and at 3 months of age by assessing general movements and calculating the Motor Optimality Score (MOS). Thirty-six infants were included. MOS at 3 months was associated with MCA-PI (rho 0.41, P = 0.04), UA-PI (rho -0.39, P = 0.047, and CPR (rho 0.50, P = 0.01). Infants with abnormal MOS had lower MCA-PI (P = 0.02) and CPR (P = 0.01) and higher UA-PI at the last measurement (P = 0.03) before birth. In infants with abnormal MOS, rcSO2 tended to be lower during the first 3 days after birth, and FTOE was significantly higher on the second day after birth (P = 0.04). Intraoperative and postoperative rcSO2 and FTOE were not associated with short-term neurological outcome. In infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD, the prenatal period may play an important role in developmental outcome. Additional research is needed to clarify the relationship between preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative cerebral oxygenation and developmental outcome in infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD.},

We present the case of a 55-year-old man undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery for severe MR caused by posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe MR with no significant aortic valve abnormalities. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) initially showed a high transvalvular aortic gradient (3 m/s) in the transgastric long-axis view, suggestive of mild-to-moderate AS. However, detailed Doppler analysis revealed a double envelope signal, representing both eccentric MR and true aortic valve flow. The closer evaluation showed the MR signal occurred earlier in the cardiac cycle, aligning with its hemodynamic timing, while the true aortic flow followed isovolumetric contraction. Subsequent three-dimensional TEE confirmed normal aortic valve morphology and function. This case highlights the importance of correlating preoperative findings, Doppler signal timing, and imaging data to avoid misdiagnosis. Systematic echocardiographic evaluation, including signal timing analysis, can differentiate between MR and AS, ensuring accurate intraoperative decision-making and preventing unnecessary interventions.},

  abstract = {Individuals can make choices based on information learned from others, a phenomenon called social learning. How observers differentiate between which individual they should or should not learn from is, however, poorly understood. Here, we showed that Drosophila melanogaster females can influence the choice of egg-laying site of other females through pheromonal marking. Mated females mark territories of high quality food by ejecting surplus male sperm containing the aggregation pheromone cis-11-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) and, in addition, deposit several sex- and species-specific cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) pheromones. These pheromonal cues affect the choices of other females, which respond by preferentially laying eggs on the marked food. This system benefits both senders and responders, as communal egg laying increases offspring survival. Virgin females, however, do not elicit a change in the egg-laying decision of mated females, even when food has been supplemented with ejected sperm from mated females, thus indicating the necessity for additional cues. Genetic ablation of either a female's CHC pheromones or those of their mate results in loss of ability of mated females to attract other females. We conclude that mated females use a pheromonal marking system, comprising cVA acquired from male ejaculate with sex- and species-specific CHCs produced by both mates, to indicate egg-laying sites. This system ensures information reliability because mated, but not virgin, females have both the ability to generate the pheromone blend that attracts other flies to those sites and a direct interest in egg-laying site quality.},

Initiation of venoarterial ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) during resuscitation might improve outcomes if used in time and in a selected patient category. However, previous studies have failed to significantly reduce the time from cardiac arrest to ECMO flow to less than 60 min. We hypothesize that the initiation of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) by a Helicopter Emergency Medical Services System (HEMS) will reduce the low flow time and improve outcomes in refractory Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) patients. The ON-SCENE study will use a non-randomised stepped wedge design to implement ECPR in patients with witnessed OHCA between the ages of 18-50 years old, with an initial presentation of shockable rhythm or pulseless electrical activity with a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism, lasting more than 20, but less than 45 min. Patients will be treated by the ambulance crew and HEMS with prehospital ECPR capabilities and will be compared with treatment by ambulance crew and HEMS without prehospital ECPR capabilities. The primary outcome measure will be survival at hospital discharge. The secondary outcome measure will be good neurological outcome defined as a cerebral performance categories scale score of 1 or 2 at 6 and 12 months. The ON-SCENE study focuses on initiating ECPR at the scene of OHCA using HEMS. The current in-hospital ECPR for OHCA obstacles encompassing low survival rates in refractory arrests, extended low-flow durations during transportation, and the critical time sensitivity of initiating ECPR, which could potentially be addressed through the implementation of the HEMS system.

We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of all consecutive maternal out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that underwent PCD in the prehospital setting between May 1995 and December 2019. Registered data included patient demographics, operator background, advanced life support interventions, and timelines. Resuscitation performance was evaluated according to the 2015 European Resuscitation Guidelines. Seven patients underwent a prehospital PCD. Three mothers died on the scene, while four were transported to a hospital but died in the hospital. Seven neonates were born by PCD. One neonate died on the scene and six were transported to a hospital. Three neonates were eventually discharged from the hospital. Among the three surviving neonates, the periods from dispatch to start of PCD were 13, 14, and 21 min. There was a low incidence of maternal perimortem caesarean deliveries in The Netherlands. Only some neonates survived after PCD. It is recommended that PCD be performed as quickly as possible. Due to the delay, the mother has a far lower chance of survival than the neonate. In fatal cases, autopsy is strongly recommended.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between a range of pre- and peroperative factors and the extent of the inflammatory response, and to identify patients at risk of a greater inflammatory response following surgery. Patients 65 years and older undergoing a surgical procedure for a solid malignant tumour were prospectively included in an observational cohort study. Inflammatory markers were measured in plasma samples pre- and postoperatively: C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Preoperative and postoperative inflammatory factor assay results were compared, and associations between inflammatory markers and pre- and peroperative factors were explored using multivariate linear regression analysis. Between July 2010 and April 2014, plasma samples of 224 patients were obtained. Median age was 72 (65-89) years and 108 (48.2%) patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was carcinoma, 156 (69.6%). Anaesthesia duration was associated with increase in CRP, IL-1β and IL-6; intracavitary surgery with increase in IL-6; blood loss with decrease in CRP and IL-1β; total fluid volume administered with a decrease in IL-1β and disease stage was associated with increase in IL-6. The perioperative inflammatory response is related more to surgical characteristics rather than to preoperative factors (with the exception of disease stage). Elderly oncological patients undergoing longer lasting, intracavitary surgical procedures for more advanced disease stages develop the most intense inflammatory response.},

Clinical improvements rely on careful patient selection and accurate electrode placement. A common method for target localization is intraoperative microelectrode recording (MER). To facilitate MER, DBS surgery is traditionally performed under local or regional anesthesia. However, sedation or general anesthesia is sometimes needed for patients who are unable to tolerate the procedure fully awake because of severe motor symptoms, psychological distress, pain, or other forms of discomfort. The effect of anesthetic drugs on MER is controversial but likely depends on the type and dose of a particular anesthetic agent, underlying disease, and surgical target. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of the current literature on the anesthetic drugs most often used for sedation and anesthesia during DBS surgery, with a focus on their effects on MERs.},

Environmental factors are thought to play a central role in ICU sleep disruption, and so it is unclear why environmental interventions have shown limited improvements in objectively assessed sleep. In critically ill patients, it is difficult to isolate the influence of environmental factors from the varying contributions of non-environmental factors. We thus investigated the effects of the ICU environment on self-reported and objective sleep quality in 10 healthy nurses and doctors with no history of sleep pathology or current or past ICU employment participated. Their sleep at home, in an unfamiliar environment ('Control'), and in an active ICU ('ICU') was evaluated using polysomnography and the Richard-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Environmental sound, light and temperature exposure were measured continuously. We found that the control and ICU environment were noisier and warmer, but not darker than the home environment. Sleep on the ICU was perceived as qualitatively worse than in the home and control environment, despite relatively modest effects on polysomnography parameters compared with home sleep: mean total sleep times were reduced by 48 min, mean rapid eye movement sleep latency increased by 45 min, and the arousal index increased by 9. Arousability to an awake state by sound was similar. Our results suggest that the ICU environment plays a significant but partial role in objectively assessed ICU sleep impairment in patients, which may explain the limited improvement of objectively assessed sleep after environmental interventions.},

Physical activity during the preoperative period was assessed subjectively with the SQUASH questionnaire and objectively with the Sensewear activity monitor (accelerometer with physiological sensors). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess differences and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreement between the measurement methods. Descriptive statistics were used for the dose-characteristics and Cohen's Kappa for the proportion of participants fulfilling the Dutch guideline for healthy physical activity (NNGB). Duration of vigorous activity was significantly higher when measured subjectively (120 min/week) than objectively (7 min/week, p = 0.001). Bland-Altman plots showed that differences between the methods increased with longer durations of moderate and total activity. The dose-characteristics of physical activity measured with the SQUASH varied widely among the participants and it consisted mainly of leisure time activities and light household activities. The percentage of participants complying with the NNGB guideline was 74% when measured subjectively and 90% when measured objectively (κ = 0.259, p = 0.089). Surprisingly, both measurement methods suggest that the majority of patients awaiting CABG surgery met the recommendations of the NNGB guideline. The agreement between the methods however decreased with higher physical activity levels. Despite its limitations, the study suggests the complementary value of a subjective and objective measurement of physical activity in free-living conditions among CABG patients.},

  abstract = {Clinical trials evaluating the safety and effectiveness of sedative medication use in critically ill adults undergoing mechanical ventilation differ considerably in their methodological approach. This heterogeneity impedes the ability to compare results across studies. The Sedation Consortium on Endpoints and Procedures for Treatment, Education, and Research Recommendations convened a meeting of multidisciplinary experts to develop recommendations for key methodologic elements of sedation trials in the ICU to help guide academic and industry clinical investigators. A 2-day in-person meeting was held in Washington, DC, on March 28-29, 2019, followed by a three-round, online modified Delphi consensus process. Thirty-six participants from academia, industry, and the Food and Drug Administration with expertise in relevant content areas, including two former ICU patients attended the in-person meeting, and the majority completed an online follow-up survey and participated in the modified Delphi process. The final recommendations were iteratively refined based on the survey results, participants' reactions to those results, summaries written by panel moderators, and a review of the meeting transcripts made from audio recordings. Fifteen recommendations were developed for study design and conduct, subject enrollment, outcomes, and measurement instruments. Consensus recommendations included obtaining input from ICU survivors and/or their families, ensuring adequate training for personnel using validated instruments for assessments of sedation, pain, and delirium in the ICU environment, and the need for methodological standardization. These recommendations are intended to assist researchers in the design, conduct, selection of endpoints, and reporting of clinical trials involving sedative medications and/or sedation protocols for adult ICU patients who require mechanical ventilation. These recommendations should be viewed as a starting point to improve clinical trials and help reduce methodological heterogeneity in future clinical trials.},

  abstract = {To summarize recent developments in the understanding of the pharmacology of the hypnotic and opioid drugs, with relevance to target-controlled infusions and newer pharmacokinetic models. General-purpose models have been developed for propofol, remifentanil, and dexmedetomidine, suitable for use in a wide variety of patients, but still not universally applicable. A validation study of the predictive performance of the Eleveld propofol model showed reasonable performance in children, healthy adults, and obese adults but poorer performance in elderly patients. Observational studies show that complications during total intravenous anesthesia often arise from omission of basic safety checks and inadequate knowledge, rather than model misspecification. Specifically, there is a lack of understanding of the influence of the clinical situation on the pharmacodynamics of hypnotic drugs. Artificial intelligence is likely to produce useful drug infusion rate advisory systems, or even closed-loop control systems that could potentially provide better patient-individualized titration of anesthetic drugs. Further efforts to develop new models are unlikely to be clinically beneficial. Efforts should rather be made to ensure better education and a better appreciation of variability in pharmacodynamics and the need for better ways of tailoring drug doses to individual patient needs.},

Sedation is commonly required during electrode implantation to attenuate anxiety, pain, and severe tics. Anesthetic agents potentially impair the quality of microelectrode recordings (MER). Little is known about the effect of these anesthetics on MER in patients with TS. We describe our experience with different sedative regimens on MER and tic severity in patients with TS. The clinical records of all TS patients who underwent DBS surgery between 2010 and 2018 were reviewed. Demographic data, stimulation targets, anesthetic agents, perioperative complications, and MER from each hemisphere were collected and analyzed. Single-unit activity was identified by filtering spiking activity from broadband MER data and principal component analysis with K-means clustering. Vocal and motor tics which caused artifacts in the MER data were manually selected using visual and auditory inspection. Six patients underwent bilateral DBS electrode implantation. In all patients, the target was the anterior internal globus pallidus. Patient comfort and hemodynamic and respiratory stability were maintained with conscious sedation with one or more of the following anesthetic drugs: propofol, midazolam, remifentanil, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Good quality MER and clinical testing were obtained in 9 hemispheres of 6 patients. In 3 patients, MER quality was poor on one side. Cautiously applied sedative drugs can provide patient comfort, hemodynamic and respiratory stability, and suppress severe tics, with minimal interference with MER.},

DBS surgery is commonly performed under local anesthesia (LA) to obtain reliable microelectrode recordings. However, procedural sedation and/or analgesia (PSA) is often desirable to improve patient comfort. The impact of PSA in addition to LA on outcome is largely unknown. Therefore, we performed an observational study to assess the effect of PSA compared to LA alone during STN DBS surgery on outcome in PD patients. Seventy PD patients (22 under LA, 48 under LA + PSA) scheduled for STN DBS implantation were included. Dexmedetomidine, clonidine or remifentanil were used for PSA. The primary outcome was the change in Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score III (MDS-UPDRS III) and levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) between baseline, one month before surgery, and twelve months postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures were motor function during activities of daily living (MDS-UPDRS II), cognitive alterations and surgical adverse events. Postoperative assessment was conducted in "on" stimulation and "on" medication conditions. At twelve months follow-up, UPDRS III and UPDRS II scores in "on" medication conditions were similar between the LA and PSA groups. The two groups showed a similar LEDD reduction and an equivalent decline in executive function measured by the Stroop Color-Word Test, Trail Making Test-B, and verbal fluency. The incidence of perioperative and postoperative adverse events was similar between groups. This study demonstrates that PSA during STN DBS implantation surgery in PD patients was not associated with differences in motor and non-motor outcome after twelve months compared with LA only.},

  abstract = {Biomarkers for neurodegenerative dementias offer interesting prospects regarding diagnosis and disease monitoring. Monoamines such as dopamine, (nor)adrenaline, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), and their respective metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were shown to be altered in dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biomarker research is hampered by potential confounds including the influence of time of day and volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected. Therefore, the possibility of a circadian rhythm in CSF and plasma, and the presence of a rostrocaudal concentration gradient (RCG) in CSF for aforementioned monoamines/metabolites, were investigated. Circadian rhythmicity was assessed using reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (RP-UHPLC-ECD) to measure monoamine/metabolite concentrations in 271 paired CSF and plasma samples, successively collected over a period of 30 h and derived from eight healthy subjects. Plasma samples were also analyzed for melatonin, serving as positive control analyte, using ELISA. The RCG examination entailed RP-UHPLC-ECD analyses on five consecutive CSF samples derived from 10 patients with AD and 10 non-AD/control subjects. Besides a diurnal rhythm for melatonin, we found a similar rhythmicity for plasma HVA, with acrophases occurring between 02:00 and 06:00 h, in four out of seven subjects. Three and two subjects showed a circadian rhythm for CSF HVA and 5-HIAA, respectively. No rhythmicity was observed in any other compound. We found that only CSF MHPG, HVA and 5-HIAA levels differed across CSF fractions, and that these changes in 5-HIAA levels varied in the AD versus non-AD/control group. Positive correlations between CSF volume and HVA and 5-HIAA levels, indicative of a RCG, were also observed. Such a RCG could not be detected for the other monoamines/metabolites. Our results stress the importance of standardizing sampling procedures of biological fluids with respect to time of day, volume and number of samples.},

We studied whether elderly patients benefit to the same extent compared with younger patients and at long-term follow up as compared with the general population. Between 2001 and 2010, data from all patients presented to our hospital after OHCA were recorded. Elderly patients (⩾75 years) were compared with younger patients. Neurological outcome was classified as cerebral performance category (CPC) at hospital discharge and long-term survival was compared with younger patients and predicted survival rates of the general population. Of the 810 patients admitted after OHCA, a total of 551 patients (68%) achieved return of spontaneous circulation, including 125 (23%) elderly patients with a mean age of 81 ± 5 years. In-hospital survival was lower in elderly patients compared with younger patients with rates of 33% versus 57% ( p < 0.001). A CPC of 1 was present in 73% of the elderly patients versus 86% of the younger patients ( p = 0.031). In 7.3% of the elderly patients, a CPC >2 was observed versus 2.5% of their younger counterparts ( p = 0.103). Elderly patients had a median survival of 6.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-7.9] years compared with 7.7 (95% CI 7.5-7.9) years of the general population ( p = 0.019). The survival rate after OHCA in elderly patients is approximately half that of younger patients. Elderly patients who survive to discharge frequently have favorable neurological outcomes and a long-term survival that approximates that of the general population.},

Blood samples were collected from a catheter in a cephalic vein at 3-7 time points between 1 and 100 min following the propofol bolus and/or infusion in five chimpanzees, or TCI in six chimpanzees. Cp was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The Marsh, Schnider and Eleveld human pharmacokinetic models were used to predict Cp for each case and we examined the predictive performances of these models using the Varvel criteria Median PE and Median APE. Median PE and Median APE for Marsh, Schnider and Eleveld models were within or close to the acceptable range. A human TCI pump was successfully maintained propofol Cp during general anesthesia in six chimpanzees. Human propofol pharmacokinetic models and TCI pumps can be applied in chimpanzees.},

  abstract = {Tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity are incapacitating motor symptoms that can be suppressed with stereotactic neurosurgical treatment like deep brain stimulation (DBS) and ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy, pallidotomy). Traditionally, clinicians rely on clinical rating scales for intraoperative evaluation of these motor symptoms during awake stereotactic neurosurgery. However, these clinical scales have a relatively high inter-rater variability and rely on experienced raters. Therefore, objective registration (e.g., using movement sensors) is a reasonable extension for intraoperative assessment of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. The main goal of this scoping review is to provide an overview of electronic motor measurements during awake stereotactic neurosurgery. The protocol was based on the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. After a systematic database search (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science), articles were screened for relevance. Hundred-and-three articles were subject to detailed screening. Key clinical and technical information was extracted. The inclusion criteria encompassed use of electronic motor measurements during stereotactic neurosurgery performed under local anesthesia. Twenty-three articles were included. These studies had various objectives, including correlating sensor-based outcome measures to clinical scores, identifying optimal DBS electrode positions, and translating clinical assessments to objective assessments. The studies were highly heterogeneous in device choice, sensor location, measurement protocol, design, outcome measures, and data analysis. This review shows that intraoperative quantification of motor symptoms is still limited by variable signal analysis techniques and lacking standardized measurement protocols. However, electronic motor measurements can complement visual evaluations and provide objective confirmation of correct placement of the DBS electrode and/or lesioning. On the long term, this might benefit patient outcomes and provide reliable outcome measures in scientific research.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of IONM and the cortical excitability in these patients. Fifteen patients with DMD and scoliosis and 15 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) underwent scoliosis correction surgery with the use of IONM. IONM consisted of transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potential (Tc-MEP) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring. The highest Tc-MEP amplitudes were collected to test the feasibility. Preoperative compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-MEPs were recorded to test the cortical excitability. SSEPs were scored as elicitable or not elicitable. Tc-MEP amplitudes were significantly lower in the DMD group for both the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. However, the abductor hallucis muscle had similar amplitudes in both the DMD as the AIS group. TMS/CMAP and Tc-MEP/CMAP ratios were similar in the DMD and AIS group (P = 0.126 and P = 0.792 respectively). Tc-MEP and SSEP monitoring is feasible, particularly when Tc-MEPs are recorded from the abductor hallucis muscle in patients with DMD. Similar TMS/CMAP and Tc-MEP/CMAP ratios show that there were no differences observed in cortical excitability between the groups. IONM seems a feasible and valuable neurophysiological tool to signal possible surgically induced damage to the spinal cord during scoliosis correction surgery in patients with DMD.},

Changes in arterial blood pressure (BP) during procedural sedation are not well described. Individual patient data from five trials of propofol sedation for colonoscopy and a clinical database were pooled and explored with logistic and linear regression. A literature search and focused meta-analysis compared the incidence of hypotension with propofol and alternative forms of procedural sedation. Hypotensive episodes were characterised by the original authors' definitions (typically systolic BP <90 mm Hg). In pooled individual patient data (n=939), 36% of procedures were associated with episodes of hypotension. Longer periods of propofol sedation and larger propofol doses were associated with longer-lasting and more-profound hypotension. Amongst 380 patients for whom individual BP measurements were available, 107 (28%) experienced systolic BP <90 mm Hg for >5 min, and in 89 (23%) the episodes exceeded 10 min. Meta-analysis of 18 RCTs identified an increased risk ratio for the development of hypotension in procedures where propofol was used compared with the use of etomidate (two studies; n=260; risk ratio [RR] 2.0 [95% confidence interval: 1.37-2.92]; P=0.0003), remimazolam (one study; n=384; RR 2.15 [1.61-2.87]; P=0.0001), midazolam (14 studies; n=2218; RR 1.46 [1.18-1.79]; P=0.0004), or all benzodiazepines (15 studies; n=2602; 1.67 [1.41-1.98]; P<0.00001). Hypotension was less likely with propofol than with dexmedetomidine (one study; n=60; RR 0.24 [0.09-0.62]; P=0.003). Hypotension is common during propofol sedation for colonoscopy and of a magnitude and duration associated with harm in surgical patients.},

Biomarker research using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a promising way to illuminate the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. CSF biomarker studies performed so far generally included patients with neurodegenerative diseases without an adequate control group. The Anaesthetic Biobank of Cerebrospinal fluid (ABC) was established to address this. The aims are to (I) provide healthy-control reference values for CSF-based biomarkers, and (II) to investigate associations between CSF-based candidate biomarkers and neuropsychiatric symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, we collect and store CSF and blood from adult patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for elective surgery. Blood (20.5 mL) is collected during intravenous cannulation and CSF (10 mL) is aspirated prior to intrathecal local anaesthetic injection. A portion of the blood and CSF is sent for routine laboratory analyses, the remaining material is stored at -80 °C. Relevant clinical, surgical and anaesthetic data are registered. A neurological examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are performed pre-operatively and a subset of patients fill in questionnaires on somatic and mental health (depression, anxiety and stress). Four-hundred-fifty patients (58% male; median age: 56 years) have been enrolled in the ABC. The planned spinal anaesthetic procedure was not attempted for various reasons in eleven patients, in fourteen patients the spinal puncture failed and in twelve patients CSF aspiration was unsuccessful. A mean of 9.3 mL CSF was obtained in the remaining 413 of patients. Most patients had a minor medical history and 60% scored in the normal range on the MoCA (median score: 26). The ABC is an ongoing biobanking project that can contribute to CSF-based biomarker research. The large sample size with constant sampling methods and extensive patient phenotyping provide excellent conditions for future neuroscientific research.},

This multicenter cohort study is an analysis of prospectively collected observational data from the Brain Injury: Prehospital Registry of Outcome, Treatments and Epidemiology of Cerebral Trauma (BRAIN-PROTECT) study in the Netherlands. Patients treated for suspected severe TBI by the Dutch Helicopter Emergency Medical Services between February 2012 and December 2017 were included.

The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality at 1 year, functional neurological recovery at discharge (measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale), and length of hospital stay. Data were also collected on demographic factors, preinjury medical condition, injury characteristics, operational characteristics, and prehospital vital parameters. A total of 1827 patients were analyzed, of whom 1283 (70%) were male individuals and the median (interquartile range) age was 45 (23-65) years. In the unadjusted analysis, higher 30-day mortality was observed in patients who received prehospital tranexamic acid (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.55; P < .001), compared with patients who did not receive prehospital tranexamic acid. After adjustment for confounders, no association between prehospital administration of tranexamic acid and mortality was found across the entire cohort of patients. However, a substantial increase in the odds of 30-day mortality persisted in patients with severe isolated TBI who received prehospital tranexamic acid (OR, 4.49; 95% CI, 1.57-12.87; P = .005) and after multiple imputations (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.22-3.45; P = .007). This study found that prehospital tranexamic acid administration was associated with increased mortality in patients with isolated severe TBI, suggesting the judicious use of the drug when no evidence for extracranial hemorrhage is present.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to explore the influence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on both postoperative cognitive dysfunction and quality of life (QoL) and the association between the two patient-related outcomes. In a prospective, observational cohort study, patients with elective, isolated CABG were included. Cognitive function was assessed using the Cogstate computerised cognitive test battery preoperatively, 3 days and 6 months after surgery. QoL was measured preoperatively and at 6 months using the RAND-36 questionnaire including the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (MCS). Regression analysis, with adjustment for confounders, was used to evaluate the association between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and QoL. A total of 142 patients were included in the study. Evidence of persistent cognitive dysfunction was observed in 33% of patients after 6 months. At 6 months, the PCS had improved in 59% and decreased in 21% of patients, and the MCS increased in 49% and decreased in 29%. Postoperative cognitive changes were not associated with QoL scores. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction and decreased QoL are common 6 months after surgery, although cognitive function and QoL were found to have improved in many patients at 6 months of follow-up. Impaired cognitive function is not associated with impaired QoL at 6 months. NCT03774342.},

This dual-centre, prospective, observational study assesses whether the availability of SmartPilot® View alters the behaviour of anaesthetic drug titration of anaesthetists and improves the Anaesthesia Quality Score (AQS; percentage of time spent with MAP 60-80 mm Hg and Bispectral Index [BIS] 40-60 [blinded]). We recruited 493 patients scheduled for elective surgery in two university centres. A control group (CONTROL; n=170) was enrolled to observe drug titration in current practice. Thereafter, an intervention group was enrolled, for which SmartPilot® View was made available to optimise drug titration (SPV; n=188). The AQS, haemodynamic and hypnotic effects, recovery times, pain scores, and other parameters were compared between groups. There were 358 patients eligible for analysis. Anaesthesia quality score was similar between CONTROL and SPV (median AQS [Q1-Q3]) 25.3% [7.4-41.5%] and 22.2% [8.0-44.4%], respectively; P=0.898). Compared with CONTROL, SPV patients had less severe hypotension and hypertension, less BIS <40, faster tracheal extubation, and lower early postoperative pain scores. Adding SmartPilot® View information did not affect average drug titration behaviour. However, small improvements in control of MAP and BIS and early recovery suggest improved titration for some patients without increasing the risk of overdosing or underdosing. NCT01467167.},

  abstract = {Severe traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young people around the world. Prehospital care focuses on the prevention and treatment of secondary brain injury and commonly includes tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia. The choice of induction agent in this setting is controversial. This study therefore investigated the association between the chosen induction medication etomidate versus S(+)-ketamine and the 30-day mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury who received prehospital airway management in the Netherlands. This study is a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected observational data of the Brain Injury: Prehospital Registry of Outcomes, Treatments and Epidemiology of Cerebral Trauma (BRAIN-PROTECT) cohort study. Patients with suspected severe traumatic brain injury who were transported to a participating trauma center and who received etomidate or S(+)-ketamine for prehospital induction of anesthesia for advanced airway management were included. Statistical analyses were performed with multivariable logistic regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis. In total, 1,457 patients were eligible for analysis. No significant association between the administered induction medication and 30-day mortality was observed in unadjusted analyses (32.9% mortality for etomidate versus 33.8% mortality for S(+)-ketamine; P = 0.716; odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.32; P = 0.711), as well as after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.73; P = 0.765; and risk difference 0.017; 95% CI, -0.051 to 0.084; P = 0.686). Likewise, in planned subgroup analyses for patients with confirmed traumatic brain injury and patients with isolated traumatic brain injury, no significant differences were found. Consistent results were found after multiple imputations of missing data. The analysis found no evidence for an association between the use of etomidate or S(+)-ketamine as an anesthetic agent for intubation in patients with traumatic brain injury and mortality after 30 days in the prehospital setting, suggesting that the choice of induction agent may not influence the patient mortality rate in this population.},

It causes an arousable state of sedation, which is beneficial during neurosurgical procedures that require the patient to cooperate with neurological tests (i.e. tumor surgery or implantation of deep brain stimulators). During procedures where monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials and/or motor evoked potentials is required, dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjunct to general anesthesia with GABAergic drugs to decrease the dose of the latter when these drugs impair the monitoring signals. The use of dexmedetomidine has also been associated with neuroprotective effects and a decreased incidence of delirium, but studies confirming these effects in the peri-operative (neuro-)surgical setting are lacking. Although dexmedetomidine does not cause respiratory depression, its hemodynamic effects are complex and careful patient selection, choice of dose, and monitoring must be performed.},

The BRAIN-PROTECT study is a prospective observational study on prehospital management of patients with severe TBI in the Netherlands. The study population comprised all consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of TBI and a prehospital GCS score ≤ 8, who were managed by one of the 4 Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS). Patients were followed-up in 9 trauma centers until 1 year after injury. Planned sub-analyses were performed for patients with "confirmed" and "isolated" TBI. Data from 2,589 patients, of whom 2,117 (81.8%) were transferred to a participating trauma center, were analyzed. The incidence rate of prehospitally suspected and confirmed severe TBI were 3.2 (95% CI: 3.1;3.4) and 2.7 (95% CI: 2.5;2.8) per 100,000 inhabitants per year, respectively. Median patient age was 46 years, 58.4% were involved in traffic crashes, of which 37.4% were bicycle related. 47.6% presented with an initial GCS of 3. The median time from HEMS dispatch to hospital arrival was 54 minutes. The overall 30-day mortality was 39.0% (95% CI: 36.8;41.2).

Predictive performance was assessed using the Varvel criteria. For PK, the Eleveld model showed a bias < ±20% in children, adults, and obese adults, but a greater bias (-27%) in older subjects. Precision was <30% in all groups. For PD, the bias and wobble were <5 BIS units and the precision was close to 10 BIS units in all groups. Anaesthetists were able to achieve intraoperative BIS values of 40-60 using effect-site target concentrations about 85-140% of the age-adjusted Ce The Eleveld propofol PK-PD model showed predictive precision <30% for arterial plasma concentrations and BIS predictions with a low (population) bias when used in TCI in clinical anaesthesia practice.},

  abstract = {For high-risk spinal surgeries, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is used to detect and prevent intraoperative neurological injury. The motor tracts are monitored by recording and analyzing muscle transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potentials (mTc-MEPs). A mTc-MEP amplitude decrease of 50-80% is the most common warning criterion for possible neurological injury. However, these warning criteria often result in false positive warnings. False positives may be caused by inadequate depth of anesthesia and blood pressure on mTc-MEP amplitudes. The aim of this paper is to validate the study protocol in which the goal is to investigate the effects of depth of anesthesia (part 1) and blood pressure (part 2) on mTc-MEPs. Per part, 25 patients will be included. In order to investigate the effects of depth of anesthesia, a processed electroencephalogram (pEEG) monitor will be used. At pEEG values of 30, 40 and 50, mTc-MEP measurements will be performed. To examine the effect of blood pressure on mTc-MEPs the mean arterial pressure will be elevated from 60 to 100 mmHg during which mTc-MEP measurements will be performed. We hypothesize that by understanding the effects of depth of anesthesia and blood pressure on mTc-MEPs, the mTc-MEP monitoring can be interpreted more reliably. This may contribute to fewer false positive warnings. By performing this study after induction and prior to incision, this protocol provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of depths of anesthesia and blood pressure on mTc-MEPs alone with as little confounders as possible.

Systemic inflammation resulting in neuroinflammation is considered important in the pathogenesis of POCD. The aim of this study was to explore the association between the early surgery-induced inflammatory response and POCD within 3 months after surgery in older cancer patients. Patients ≥65 years in need of surgery for a solid tumor were included in a prospective cohort study. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured perioperatively. Cognitive performance was assessed preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. POCD was defined as a decline in cognitive test scores of ≥25% on ≥2 of five tests within the different cognitive domains of memory, executive functioning, and information processing speed. Logistic regression analysis was performed. POCD was observed in 44 (17.7%) of 248 included patients. Age >75, preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≤26 and major surgery were independent significant predictors for POCD. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, no significant associations were shown between the early surgery-induced inflammatory response and either POCD or decline within the different cognitive domains. This study shows that one out of six older patients with cancer developed POCD within 3 months after surgery. The early surgery-induced inflammatory response was neither associated with POCD, nor with decline in the separate cognitive domains. Further research is necessary for better understanding of the complex etiology of POCD.},

There is growing interest in exercise programs as part of surgical 'prehabilitation'. We therefore studied preoperative physical activity levels of patients undergoing elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery, and performed an exploratory analysis of the influence of physical activity on postoperative outcome. The Short Questionnaire to Assess Health (SQUASH) was used to assess physical activity among 100 patients, of mean (SD) age 65.4 (7.6) years. Additionally, handgrip strength was measured, and the get-up-and-go test was conducted. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed, and a computerised cognitive test battery was used to assess cognitive performance preoperatively, and three months after surgery. Preoperatively, 76% of patients met the recommended national guidelines for physical activity. The incidence of pre-existing medical conditions, and other pre-operative patient features were similar in active and inactive patients. Preoperative physical activity was significantly inversely related to the logistic EuroSCORE. The level of physical activity was also significantly inversely related with preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) and peak postoperative CRP, but physical activity did not appear to be associated with any adverse postoperative outcomes or extended length of hospital stay. The incidence of postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PNCD) at 3 months postoperatively was 26%. Cognitive performance was not related with physical activity levels. In summary, this was the first study to assess activity levels of cardiac surgical patients with the SQUASH questionnaire. The majority of patients were physically active. Although physical activity was associated with lower levels of inflammation in this pilot study, it was not associated with an improved clinical or cognitive postoperative outcome.},

We aimed to investigate the association of anesthetic and physiological parameters with mTc-MEPs. Intraoperative mTc-MEP amplitudes, mTc-MEP area under the curves (AUC), and anesthetic and physiological measurements were collected retrospectively from the records of 108 consecutive patients undergoing elective spinal surgery. Pharmacological parameters of interest included propofol and opioid concentration, ketamine and noradrenaline infusion rates. Physiological parameters recorded included mean arterial pressure (MAP), bispectral index (BIS), heart rate, hemoglobin O 2 saturation, temperature, and Et co2 . A forward selection procedure was performed using multivariable mixed model analysis. Data from 75 (69.4%) patients were included. MAP and BIS were significantly associated with mTc-MEP amplitude ( P < .001). mTc-MEP amplitudes increased by 6.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7%-10.4%) per 10 mm Hg increase in MAP and by 2.79% (CI, 2.26%-3.32%) for every unit increase in BIS. MAP ( P < .001), BIS ( P < .001), heart rate ( P = .01), and temperature ( P = .02) were significantly associated with mTc-MEP AUC. The AUC increased by 7.5% (CI, 3.3%-11.7%) per 10 mm Hg increase of MAP, by 2.98% (CI, 2.41%-3.54%) per unit increase in BIS, and by 0.68% (CI, 0.13%-1.23%) per beat per minute increase in heart rate. mTc-MEP AUC decreased by 21.4% (CI, -38.11% to -3.98%) per degree increase in temperature. MAP, BIS, heart rate, and temperature were significantly associated with mTc-MEP amplitude and/or AUC. Maintenance of BIS and MAP at the high normal values may attenuate anesthetic effects on mTc-MEPs.},

  abstract = {Transcranial electrical stimulation muscle-recorded motor evoked potentials (Tc-mMEPs) are used to monitor the spinal cord motor tracts during spinal surgery. There is considerable intra- and interindividual variability in the signals recorded, causing a high incidence of false positive warnings. Inadequate blood pressure is commonly blamed for false positive warnings and is usually managed with fluid and vasopressor therapy. The aim of the study was to systematically investigate the effects of norepinephrine and ephedrine-induced arterial blood pressure elevation on Tc-mMEPs. Twenty-five patients undergoing spinal surgery were included in this prospective observational study. After anesthetic induction and positioning, but before incision, a norepinephrine infusion was used to increase the mean arterial pressure (MAP) from approximately 60 to 100 mm Hg. Tc-mMEP amplitudes and area under the curves (AUC) were recorded from the abductor hallucis (AH), tibialis anterior (TA), and hand muscles every 2 minutes. Voltage thresholds of the AH, TA, and hand muscles were determined at MAP values of 60, 80, and 100 mm Hg. The primary objective was to determine the effects of increasing the MAP with a vasopressor infusion on Tc-mMEP amplitude, AUC, and threshold. For the secondary objective, the outcomes were adjusted for depth of anesthesia and propofol concentrations. Post hoc analyses included adjusting for confounders, noradrenaline infusion rate, and use of ephedrine, investigating the effects of cardiac index on Tc-mMEP characteristics, investigating the influence of increasing MAP on the excitability of the peripheral nervous system, and investigating the effects of MAP on BIS. In the AH, TA, and hand muscles, Tc-mMEP amplitudes and AUC were significantly associated with MAP (P < .02). A 10 mm Hg increase of the MAP was associated with a 11.0% to 17.7% increase in the amplitude and a 10.5% to 16.8% increase in the AUC. When adjusting for BIS, propofol concentrations, and use of ephedrine, MAP remained only significantly associated with the Tc-mMEP amplitude (P = .002) and AUC (P = .003) of the AH muscles. The influence of cardiac index on Tc-mMEP amplitude and AUC provided similar results when compared to the influence of MAP on Tc-mMEP amplitude and AUC. No influence of increasing MAP on the excitability of the peripheral nervous system was found. Increasing MAP significantly increased BIS values, even when corrected for propofol concentrations. Elevation of MAP is associated with significantly higher Tc-mMEP amplitudes, AUCs, and lower voltage threshold. When corrected for BIS, propofol concentration, and use of ephedrine, the associations between increasing MAP and Tc-mMEP characteristics were largely attenuated. BIS values significantly increased by increasing MAP, when corrected for propofol concentration. Thereby, our results imply that increasing MAP increases the cortical excitability.},

  abstract = {During hyperglycaemia, some glucose bypasses glycolysis and is metabolised via the potentially neurotoxic polyol pathway, in which glucose is metabolised to sorbitol and fructose. Increased polyol concentrations have been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neurological patients with and without diabetes mellitus. However, polyol levels in patients without evident neurological abnormalities have not been investigated so far. The aim of this study was to determine CSF polyol concentrations in patients without major neurological disease with normal or elevated CSF glucose concentrations. This observational cohort study used CSF and plasma analyses, as well as clinical data, from 30 participants of the Anaesthetic Biobank of Cerebrospinal Fluid study. Biomaterial was collected from adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under spinal anaesthesia. CSF polyol concentrations were measured by GC/flame ionisation detector in ten patients with normal CSF glucose levels (group 1), ten patients with elevated CSF glucose levels (group 2) and ten patients with elevated CSF glucose levels and type 2 diabetes (group 3). We compared the concentrations of plasma glucose, CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose, and CSF polyol/glucose ratios between the three groups, and determined the correlation between plasma glucose levels and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose levels. Groups 2 and 3 had significantly higher CSF fructose levels compared with group 1 (p=0.036 and p<0.001, respectively). Group 3 showed significant differences compared with groups 1 and 2 for CSF sorbitol (p<0.001 and 0.036, respectively). Moreover, patients with diabetes had a significantly higher CSF sorbitol/glucose ratio compared with patients without diabetes. There was a strong positive correlation between plasma glucose and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose. Finally, age, sex, CSF/plasma albumin ratio and preoperative cognitive function scores were significantly correlated with plasma glucose and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose levels. Hyperglycaemia causes a proportional increase in polyol concentrations in CSF of patients without major neurological disease. Furthermore, this study provides the first indication of upregulation of the cerebral polyol pathway in patients with diabetes without evident neurological abnormalities.},

The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between the intraoperative MLE and the clinical effect of DBS. Thirty Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III (MDS-UPDRS III) scores during bilateral STN-DBS implantation were included in this retrospective study. MDS-UPDRS III subscores (resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia) of the contralateral upper extremity were used. During surgery, these subscores were assessed directly before and after insertion of the electrode. Also, these subscores were determined in the outpatient clinic after 11 weeks on average (on-stimulation). All assessments were performed in an off-medication state (at least 12 hours of medication washout). Postinsertion MDS-UPDRS motor scores decreased significantly compared to preinsertion scores (p < 0.001 for both hemispheres). The MLE showed a positive correlation with the clinical effect of DBS in both hemispheres (rho = 0.68 for the primarily treated hemisphere, p < 0.001, and rho = 0.59 for the secondarily treated hemisphere, p < 0.01). The MLE has a clinically relevant correlation with the effect of DBS in PD patients. These results suggest that the MLE can be relied upon as evidence of a clinically effective DBS electrode placement.},

The effect of these agents on MER are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of commonly used PSA agents, dexmedetomidine, clonidine and remifentanil and patient characteristics on MER during DBS surgery. Data from 78 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent STN-DBS surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The procedures were performed under local anesthesia or under PSA with dexmedetomidine, clonidine or remifentanil. In total, 4082 sites with multi-unit activity (MUA) and 588 with single units were acquired. Single unit firing rates and coefficient of variation (CV), and MUA total power were compared between patient groups. We observed a significant reduction in MUA, an increase of the CV and a trend for reduced firing rate by dexmedetomidine. The effect of dexmedetomidine was dose-dependent for all measures. Remifentanil had no effect on the firing rate but was associated with a significant increase in CV and a decrease in MUA. Clonidine showed no significant effect on firing rate, CV or MUA. In addition to anesthetic effects, MUA and CV were also influenced by patient-dependent variables. Our results showed that PSA influenced neuronal properties in the STN and the dexmedetomidine (DEX) effect was dose-dependent. In addition, patient-dependent characteristics also influenced MER.},

Dental treatment is often impossible in geriatric MND patients with CRB. Intranasal midazolam may provide a non-invasive sedation method, but there is currently no information on its use in geriatric patients. In this observational study, we included geriatric patients with severe MND and CRB needing urgent dental treatment. Each patient received 5 mg midazolam intranasally. Agitation/sedation levels, heart rate, respiration rate and oxygen saturation were recorded at 5-minute intervals. Thirty two patients were included. Mean age was 84 (±7) years. Mean (SD) time to treatment start was 13 (±5) minutes, and mean time to maximum sedation 17 (±11) minutes. Sedation was sufficient to enable dental treatment to be completed in 31 (97%) patients. Anxiolysis/light sedation occurred in 16 (50%) patients, and moderate to deep sedation occurred in 16 (50%) patients. No patients suffered from apnoea, although 3 patients required a chin-lift manoeuvre. Hypoxaemia occurred in 1 of these patients and in 2 other patients without airway obstruction. All patients recovered uneventfully. In a regression model, age, weight and other sedative medication use were found not to be associated with maximum sedation depth. Of 5 mg intranasal midazolam facilitates treatment of geriatric patients with MND in the comfort of their own environment. More information is needed to guide titration to balance the desired sedation level and patient safety.},

  abstract = {Potential biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamines and their corresponding precursors and metabolites. During CSF sampling, CSF flows towards the lumbar sampling site from more cranial regions. To compare the results of studies in which different CSF volumes were acquired, it is important to know if ventricular-lumbar concentration gradients exist. This has only been addressed for a few biogenic amines, and almost exclusively in neurologically unwell patients due to the burden of a lumbar puncture (necessary to obtain CSF). The aim of our study was to determine if concentration gradients exist for routinely measured CSF constituents and biogenic amines in neurologically healthy patients. We applied a novel ultrasensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of multiple monoamines, precursors and metabolites in CSF and plasma. CSF and blood samples were collected from twenty neurologically healthy patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia. Ten mL of lumbar CSF was collected in five consecutive two mL fractions. We determined leucocyte and erythrocyte counts, glucose, albumin and protein concentrations and quantified monoamines, precursors and metabolites on each of the fractions using LC-MS/MS. In twenty patients (60% male; median age: 46 years), dopamine, DOPAC, 3-MT, HVA, noradrenaline, normetanephrine and 5-HIAA concentrations increased from the first to the last CSF fraction (all p < 0.001). CSF adrenaline concentrations were below the detection limit, whereas serotonin measurements were regarded as unreliable. Albumin and total protein levels decreased significantly across CSF fractions. A ventricular-lumbar CSF concentration gradient existed for most of the investigated analytes. This is a novel finding for dopamine, noradrenaline, 3-MT and normetanephrine. These results contribute to the understanding of the neurobiology and underline the importance of standardized procedures for CSF handling to allow comparisons between studies.},

Patients 65 years and older undergoing surgery for removal of a solid malignant tumour were included in an observational cohort study. All complications occurring up to 30 days postoperatively were documented prospectively. Inflammatory markers were measured in plasma samples pre- and postoperatively: C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Associations between inflammatory markers and postoperative complications were explored using logistic regression analysis. Between July 2010 and April 2014, plasma samples of 224 patients were collected. Median age was 72 (65-89) years and 116 (51.8%) patients were female. Approximately half of the patients developed postoperative complications (49.6%) of whom 62 patients (55.9%) developed >1 complication. An independent prognostic effect was observed for the inflammatory biomarkers IL-6 and IL-10 for the occurrence of postoperative complications. The perioperative inflammatory response is associated with complications, independently from patient and surgical factors which are also associated with outcome. Research is warranted towards further exploration of the perioperative inflammatory response with the aim to improve perioperative care and outcome, and might help to improve surgical planning and decision making for older patients with cancer.},

Observations from 350 individuals (220 men, 130 women) were analyzed, comprising 6,312 ABP-700 concentrations, 5,658 ABP-700 metabolite (CPM-acid) concentrations, 25,745 filtered BIS values, and 6,249 MOAA/S scores, and a recirculatory model developed. Various subject covariates and pretreatment with an opioid or a benzodiazepine were explored as covariates. Relationships between BIS and MOAA/S models and involuntary muscle movements were examined. The final model shows that the pharmacokinetics of ABP-700 are characterized by small compartmental volumes and rapid clearance. The BIS model incorporates an effect-site for BIS suppression and a secondary excitatory/disinhibitory effect-site associated with a risk of involuntary muscle movements. The secondary effect-site has a threshold that decreases with age. The MOAA/S model did not show excitatory effects. The GABAA receptor agonist ABP-700 shows the expected suppressive effects for BIS and MOAA/S, but also disinhibitory effects for BIS associated with involuntary muscle movements and reduced by pretreatment. Our model provides information about involuntary muscle movements that may be useful to improve depth of anesthesia monitoring for GABAA receptor agonists.},

In this prospective cohort study, patients 65 years and older in need for oncologic surgery were included. Inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL10 and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured in plasma samples pre- and post-operatively. Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOS) was used as screening instrument for POD in the first week after surgery. In case of positive screening, diagnosis of POD was assessed by a clinician. Between 2010 and 2016, plasma samples of 311 patients with median age of 72 years (range 65-89) were collected. A total of 38 (12%) patients developed POD in the first week after surgery. The perioperative increase in plasma levels of IL-10 and NGAL were associated with POD in multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 1.33 [1.09-1.63] P = 0.005 and OR 1.30 [1.03-1.64], P = 0.026, respectively). The biomarkers CRP, IL-1β and IL-6 were not significantly associated with POD. Increased surgery-evoked inflammatory responses of IL-10 and NGAL are associated with the development of POD in older oncological patients. The outcomes of this study contribute to understanding the aetiology of neuroinflammation and the development of POD.},

While several studies have investigated the ability of the underlying pharmacokinetic-dynamic models to predict plasma concentrations, there are no data on their performance in predicting drug concentrations in the human brain. We assessed the predictive performance of the Marsh propofol model and Minto remifentanil model for plasma and brain tissue concentrations. Plasma samples were obtained during neurosurgery from 38 patients, and brain tissue samples from nine patients. Propofol and remifentanil concentrations were measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analysed from the nine patients in whom both plasma and brain samples were simultaneously obtained. For the Minto model (five patients), the median performance error was 72% for plasma and -14% for brain tissue concentration predictions. The model tended to underestimate plasma remifentanil concentrations, and to overestimate brain tissue remifentanil concentrations. For the Marsh model (five patients), the median prediction errors for plasma and brain tissue concentrations were 12% and 81%, respectively. However, when the data from all blood propofol assays (36 patients) were analysed, the median prediction error was 11%, with overprediction in 15 (42%) patients and underprediction in 21 (58%). These findings confirm earlier reports demonstrating inaccuracy for commonly used pharmacokinetic-dynamic models for plasma concentrations and extend these findings to the prediction of effect-site concentrations.},

Collaboration amongst clinicians within networks instead of competition between clinicians can have wide-ranging benefits that extend beyond research, and can include improvements in training, rapid dissemination of protocols, and knowledge concerning new problems, ultimately improving general standards of care.},

  abstract = {Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using a mixture of propofol and remifentanil in the same syringe has become an accepted technique in Pediatric Anesthesia. A survey by a group of respected UK anesthetists demonstrated a low incidence of serious complications, related to the pharmacology and dose of the drugs. However, a current guideline for the safe use of TIVA recommends against this practice. Pharmaceutical concerns include the physical stability of the emulsion when remifentanil is mixed with propofol; changes in drug concentration over time; nonuniform mixing of propofol and remifentanil; the risk of bacterial contamination; and the potential for drug administration errors. Propofol and remifentanil have markedly different pharmacokinetic profiles. When remifentanil is mixed with propofol and delivered as a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol, remifentanil delivery is not target-controlled but passively follows the variable infusion rates calculated by the syringe driver to deliver predicted plasma or effect-site concentrations of propofol. The pharmacokinetic consequences can be illustrated using pharmacokinetic modeling similar to that used in TCI pumps. The clinical consequences reflect the dose-dependent pharmacodynamics of remifentanil. Increasing the target propofol concentration produces a rapid increase and peak in remifentanil concentration that risks apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension, especially with higher concentrations of remifentanil. The faster decline in remifentanil concentration with falling propofol concentrations risks inadequate narcosis and unwanted responses to surgical stimuli. Remifentanil delivery is inflexible and dosing cannot be adjusted to the clinical need and responses of individual patients. The medicolegal considerations are stark. In UK and EU Law, mixing propofol and remifentanil creates a new, unlicensed drug and the person mixing takes on the responsibilities of manufacturer. If a patient receiving anesthesia in the form of a mixed propofol-remifentanil infusion suffered a critical incident or actual harm, the clinician's practice may come under scrutiny and criticism, potentially involving a legal challenge and the Medical Regulator.},

  abstract = {In laboratory animals, exposure to most general anaesthetics leads to neurotoxicity manifested by neuronal cell death and abnormal behaviour and cognition. Some large human cohort studies have shown an association between general anaesthesia at a young age and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficits, but these studies are prone to bias. Others have found no evidence for an association. We aimed to establish whether general anaesthesia in early infancy affects neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this international, assessor-masked, equivalence, randomised, controlled trial conducted at 28 hospitals in Australia, Italy, the USA, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, we recruited infants of less than 60 weeks' postmenstrual age who were born at more than 26 weeks' gestation and were undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy, without previous exposure to general anaesthesia or risk factors for neurological injury. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a web-based randomisation service to receive either awake-regional anaesthetic or sevoflurane-based general anaesthetic. Anaesthetists were aware of group allocation, but individuals administering the neurodevelopmental assessments were not. Parents were informed of their infants group allocation upon request, but were told to mask this information from assessors. The primary outcome measure was full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, third edition (WPPSI-III), at 5 years of age. The primary analysis was done on a per-protocol basis, adjusted for gestational age at birth and country, with multiple imputation used to account for missing data. An intention-to-treat analysis was also done. A difference in means of 5 points was predefined as the clinical equivalence margin. This completed trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00756600. Between Feb 9, 2007, and Jan 31, 2013, 4023 infants were screened and 722 were randomly allocated: 363 (50%) to the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 359 (50%) to the general anaesthesia group. There were 74 protocol violations in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and two in the general anaesthesia group. Primary outcome data for the per-protocol analysis were obtained from 205 children in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 242 in the general anaesthesia group. The median duration of general anaesthesia was 54 min (IQR 41-70). The mean FSIQ score was 99·08 (SD 18·35) in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 98·97 (19·66) in the general anaesthesia group, with a difference in means (awake-regional anaesthesia minus general anaesthesia) of 0·23 (95% CI -2·59 to 3·06), providing strong evidence of equivalence. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were similar to those of the per-protocol analysis. Slightly less than 1 h of general anaesthesia in early infancy does not alter neurodevelopmental outcome at age 5 years compared with awake-regional anaesthesia in a predominantly male study population.

This study investigates the occurrence of intestinal integrity loss during oncologic surgery, measured by I-FABP change. Secondary the relationship between compromised intestinal integrity, and related variables and complications were studied. Patients undergoing oncologic surgery from prospective cohort studies were included. Urine I-FABP samples were collected preoperatively (T0) and at wound closure (T1), and in a subgroup on Day 1 (D1) and Day 2 (D2) postoperatively. I-FABP dynamics were investigated and logistic regression analyses were performed to study the association between I-FABP levels and patient-related, surgical variables and complications. A total of 297 patients were included with median age of 70 years. Median I-FABP value increased from 80.0 pg/mL at T0 (interquartile range [IQR] 38.0-142.0) to 115 pg/mL at T1 (IQR 48.0-198.0) (p < 0.05). Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.08) and anesthesia time (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25) were related to stronger I-FABP increase. When comparing I-FABP change in patients experiencing any complications versus no complications, relative I-FABP change at T1 was 145% of T0 (IQR 86-260) versus 113% (IQR 44-184) respectively (p < 0.05). A significant change in I-FABP levels was seen perioperatively indicating compromised intestinal integrity. Age and anesthesia time were related to higher I-FABP increase. In patients experiencing postoperative complications, a higher I-FABP increase was found.},

Although POCD has been the subject of considerable research over the past decades, it remains uncertain why some patients do not return to preoperative levels of cognitive function. Surgery and anesthesia have both been implicated to play a role in POCD development, and certain patient-related factors, such as advanced age and low preoperative baseline cognitive function, have consistently been found to predict postoperative cognitive decline. This article will present an overview of POCD and its etiology and provide advice on possible strategies on its prevention.},

The present study explores human inter-rater agreement in sleep stage scoring following the AASM guidelines, within a heterogenous ICU patient cohort. Two human experts independently scored a total of 51,454 epochs in 20 PSG recordings acquired at the ICU. Epoch-per-epoch comparison of scored stages revealed a Cohen's κ coefficient of agreement of 0.36 for standard 5-stage scoring. Highest agreement occurred in Wake (κ = 0.46), while REM showed the lowest (κ = 0.12). Significant correlations were found between inter-rater agreement, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II, r = - 0.506, p = 0.038), and 12-month mortality (r = - 0.524, p = 0.031).

The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the incidence of events with potential adverse health consequences within this service model and the risk factors for the occurrence of these events. We retrospectively interrogated a database containing the computerized anesthetic records of 2937 procedures where moderate-to-deep sedation was provided using TCI administration of propofol and remifentanil between May 2014 and October 2017. The primary outcome measures were the incidence of sedation-related events with potential adverse health consequences and risk factors for the occurrence of such events. The events under investigation were unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), death on the day of the procedure due to sedation-related events, cardiovascular events (arrhythmias, hypertension, and hypotension), pulmonary events (aspiration, desaturation, unplanned tracheal intubation), anaphylactic or allergic reactions, and the termination of the procedure due to sedation-related events. Cardiovascular and pulmonary events were classified as severe, significant, or moderate. Events were identified by using computer algorithms to search the computerized records from all included procedures. Data from 2937 procedures were analyzed. No patients suffered catastrophic events (death, need for CPR, or unplanned ICU admission). Thirty-two severe sedation-related events occurred in 32 procedures. Severe desaturation (0.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-0.9) and severe hypertension (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.04-0.37) were the most common severe events. Significant hypotension (8.8%; 95% CI, 7.73-9.77) and significant desaturation (1.6%; 95% CI, 1.12-2.02) were found to be the most common events with potential adverse health consequences. No patient suffered lasting health consequences. Average mean and maximum targeted effect-site concentrations (Cet) for propofol were 2.6 ± 0.83 and 3.3 ± 1.09 µg·mL, respectively, and for remifentanil 0.84 ± 0.18 and 0.99 ± 0.22 ng·mL, respectively. Maximum Cets of propofol were lower among patients with higher body mass index (BMI) and were higher among patients of younger age. Higher BMI was a risk factor for desaturation. Increased age and lower BMI were risk factors for hypotension. Longer procedure time was a risk factor for both desaturation and hypotension. Moderate-to-deep sedation by propofol and remifentanil TCI has a low incidence of catastrophic and severe events.},

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models can increase the accuracy of intravenous drug titration, especially in populations that differ from the 'average.' However, with a growing number of PKPD models, and other technology available to date, it can be hard to see the wood for the trees. This review attempts to guide the reader through the PKPD jungle. General purpose PKPD models for propofol and remifentanil designed to apply to a broader population, including children, the elderly and the obese, reduce the need for population-specific models. PKPD models for drugs such as dexmedetomidine and antimicrobial agents may be useful for procedural sedation or in the ICU. Technological advances such as Bayesian model adjustment based on point-of-care plasma concentration measurements, closed-loop drug delivery and artificial intelligence may improve the ease of use of the anaesthetic drugs and increase the accuracy of titration. Newer and more complex modelling techniques and technological advancements can help to deliver anaesthetic drugs, sedatives and other drugs in a more stable and thereby safer way.},

NCD affected 12.3% of elderly patients (age ≥ 70 years, n = 57) at 3 months after surgery, with executive function mostly affected. By contrast, 8.4% of younger patients (age < 70 years, n = 107) were affected, with information processing speed mostly affected. Low educational attainment was a risk factor (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.9-19.0) of overall NCD, whereas preoperative anxiety was associated with decline in the domain of executive function. Postoperative NCD is a complication of oncological surgery for all adults instead of the elderly only. Preoperative anxiety was associated with an increased risk of executive function decline, and low educational attainment was a key factor for overall NCD.},

This review focuses on recent comparative studies of commonly used and new drugs for adult ambulatory sedation. Midazolam and propofol are commonly used for ambulatory sedation. Their pharmacological properties offer many advantages and there is much experience with their use. Ketamine can be a useful addition to hypnotic drugs but the advantage of the use of ketofol (a mixture of propofol and ketamine) is, although often practiced, difficult to assess. Dexmedetomidine is a relatively new sedative drug and many studies suggest advantages. New findings about its effects, however, show that the hemodynamic consequences of the use of dexmedetomidine may last for several hours. New sedative drugs for procedural sedation are still being developed: remimazolam has many properties that would make it an ideal sedative and has been studied in a phase 3 study. The properties that would constitute the ideal sedative have yet to be combined in one drug. The selection of the drugs used for ambulatory sedation depends on many factors such as procedure type, patient characteristics and the expectations of patients and the healthcare provider. Because of this, the literature cannot yet provide a definitive answer to the question which drug is best selected in a specific situation.},

In recent years, successful attempts have been made to harmonize these criteria and, consequently, to improve public trust in the process and diagnosis. An international multidisciplinary collaboration has been created and it has published minimum criteria, provided guidance for professionals and encouragement to revise or develop guidelines on brain death/DNC worldwide. There are two sets of criteria for declaration of death. First, if there is neither cardiac output nor respiratory effort, then cardiopulmonary criteria are used. Second, if both the cerebrum and brainstem have completely and permanently lost all functions, and there is a persistent coma, absent brainstem reflexes and no spontaneous respiratory effort, death can be declared on the basis of brain death/DNC. Although attempts to formulate uniform criteria are ongoing, consensus has been reached on the minimum criteria. Some inconsistencies and questions remain.},

Before temporary colostomy take-down: anal leakage and discomfort, dignity impairment, struggling to locate the contracting muscle, restoring anal strength. After colostomy take-down: loss of defecating control again and damage to peri-anal skin, perceived effects and insistence on persisting with training, faith in effectiveness, trying to comply, trying to restrict medication use, maintaining a hygienic self-image and dignity, promoting quality of life, and a chance to regain a normal life. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS: Participants described the rehabilitation exercise as beneficial to controlling the defecation and expressed their intent to continue such.

To determine the rate-limiting steps in Se volatilization from selenate and selenite, time- and concentration-dependent kinetics of Se accumulation and volatilization were studied in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea). Time-dependent kinetic studies showed that selenate was taken up 2-fold faster than selenite. Selenate was rapidly translocated to the shoot, away from the root, the site of volatilization, whereas only approximately 10% of the selenite was translocated. For both selenate- and selenite-supplied plants, Se accumulation and volatilization increased linearly with external Se concentration up to 20 &mgr;M; volatilization rates were also linearly correlated with root Se concentrations. Se-volatilization rates were 2- to 3-fold higher from plants supplied with selenite compared with selenate. Se speciation by x-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that selenite-supplied plants accumulated organic Se, most likely selenomethionine, whereas selenate-supplied plants accumulated selenate. Our data suggest that Se volatilization from selenate is limited by the rate of selenate reduction, as well as by the availability of Se in roots, as influenced by uptake and translocation. Se volatilization from selenite may be limited by selenite uptake and by the conversion of selenomethionine to dimethylselenide.},

The three animal groups were indistinguishable in their external physical characteristics, sensorimotor skills and indices of anxiety-like behaviors. In the open field, however, homozygous animals were hyperactive and appeared to show less habituation to the initially novel environment. In the Morris water maze, homozygous animals displayed clear deficits in spatial learning and memory with marginal deficits in visual association learning. Apart from the last mentioned deficits, these abnormalities are consistent with hippocampal dysfunction and in some cases with elevated dopaminergic transmission via D2 dopamine receptors. As similar deficits in spatial learning and memory have been found in schizophrenia, where decreased dysbindin-1 has been found in the hippocampus, the sandy mouse may also model certain aspects of cognition and behavior relevant to schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to describe the CT and MR imaging findings of gouty tophi in the wrist and present this entity as a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. Retrospective review of the CT (n = 18) and MR imaging (n = 20) studies of the wrist in patients with a documented diagnosis of gout who presented with gout-related carpal tunnel syndrome was performed; images of 24 wrists were collected over a 5-year period. Patient population included 20 men, who ranged in age from 35 to 76 years. All images were reviewed by two musculoskeletal radiologists who reached a consensus opinion. Surgical correlation was available in 12 patients. Tophi were found in the floor of the carpal tunnel (n = 18), carpal bones (n = 17), radiocarpal joint (n = 17), and extensor tendons or tendon sheaths (n = 16) of the wrist. All tophi showed similar signal characteristics (from low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images with heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images) with the exception of tophi in the floor of the carpal tunnel (low signal intensity on T2-weighted images). Varying degrees of calcification were noted on CT and MR imaging studies. Gadolinium-enhanced MR studies showed heterogeneous enhancement. Gouty tophi should be entertained as a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome in the appropriate patient population. Familiarity with this entity and its imaging characteristics may prove helpful in diagnosis and preoperative planning.},

In order to improve PAC nursing education and quality of care, the present study applies a modified Delphi method to identify the core competences of nurses who provide PAC services to acute stroke patients. We surveyed 18 experts in post-acute care and long-term care anonymously using a 29-question questionnaire in order to identify the essential professional skills that are required to perform PAC effectively. The results of this survey indicate that the core competences of PAC may be divided into two categories: Case Management and Care Management. Case Management includes Direct Care, Communication, Health Care Education, Nursing Consulting, and Family Assessment & Health Care. Care Management includes Interdisciplinary Teamwork, Patient Care Management, and Resource Integration. The importance and practicality of each item was evaluated using a 7-point Likert scale. The experts required 2 rounds to reach a consensus about the importance and 3 rounds to determine the practicality of PAC core competences. This process highlighted the differing points of view that are held by professionals in the realms of nursing, medicine, and national health policy. The PAC in-job training program in its current form inadequately cul-tivates core competence in Care Management. The results of the present study may be used to inform the development of PAC nurse orientation training programs and continuing education courses.},

The 3D model was modified, placed inside a digitally designed housing unit and fabricated on a desktop 3D printer using polylactic acid (PLA) filament. The model was filled with an echogenic solution of gelatin with psyllium fiber. Twenty-two staff anesthesiologists performed a spinal and epidural on the 3D printed simulator and a commercially available Simulab phantom. Participants evaluated the tactile and ultrasound imaging fidelity of both phantoms via Likert-scale questionnaire. The 3D printed neuraxial phantom cost $13 to print and required 25 hours of non-supervised printing and 2 hours of assembly time. The 3D printed phantom was found to be less realistic to surface palpation than the Simulab phantom due to fragility of the silicone but had significantly better fidelity for loss of resistance, dural puncture and ultrasound imaging than the Simulab phantom. Low-cost neuraxial phantoms with fidelity comparable to commercial models can be produced using CT data and low-cost infrastructure consisting of FLOS software and desktop 3D printers.},

The effect of insulin administration on renal potassium excretion is unclear. Some studies suggest that insulin has an antikaliuretic effect although plasma potassium levels were poorly controlled. Since the introduction of glycemic control in the intensive care unit, insulin use has increased. We examined the relation between administered insulin and renal potassium excretion in critically ill patients under computer-assisted glucose and potassium regulation. Prospective observational study. Twelve-bed surgical intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital. Consecutive intensive care unit patients. Potassium and glucose levels were regulated by a computer-assisted decision support system. Both potassium and insulin were continuously administered by syringe pump. Renal potassium excretion was measured daily in the 24-hr urine collections. The 24-hr urinary samples of patients with kidney failure or on renal replacement therapy were excluded. Multivariate analysis with potassium excretion as the dependent variable was performed. In 178 consecutive patients, 1,456 24-hr urinary samples, were analyzed. Mean ± SD plasma potassium was 4.2 ± 0.3 mmol/L, with 79 ± 46 mmol/d of potassium administered and a mean insulin dose of 53 ± 38 U/day. Renal potassium excretion was 126 ± 51 mmol/day. After multivariate analysis correcting for relevant variables (including diuretics, pH, potassium levels and renal sodium excretion), insulin administration was independently and positively associated with renal potassium excretion. Other significant variables were potassium levels, potassium administration, renal sodium and chloride excretion, creatinine clearance, diuretic therapy, pH, known diabetes and intensive care unit admission day (R = .52; p <. 001). Insulin administration is associated with an increase in the renal potassium excretion in critically ill patients.},

The RAARR algorithm can automatically assign experimental spectra under a broad range of conditions, including spectra comprised of multiple mixture components, in ≲100 s. The RAARR algorithm exploits constraints placed by the conservation of energy to find sets of connected lines in an unassigned spectrum. The highly constrained structure of these sets eliminates all but a handful of plausible assignments for a given set, greatly reducing the number of potential assignments that must be evaluated. We successfully apply our algorithm to automatically assign 15 experimental spectra, including 5 previously unassigned species, without prior estimation of molecular rotational constants. In 9 of the 15 cases, the RAARR algorithm successfully assigns two or more mixture components.},

Since the inflammatory milieu can cause important alterations in epithelial cell function, we examined the cytokine effects on the expression of the enterocyte differentiation marker, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), a protein that detoxifies bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and limits fat absorption. Sodium butyrate (NaBu), a short-chain fatty acid and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was used to induce IAP expression in HT-29 cells and the cells were also treated +/- the cytokines. Northern blots confirmed IAP induction by NaBu, however, pretreatment (6 h) with either cytokine showed a dose-dependent inhibition of IAP expression. IAP Western analyses and alkaline phosphatase enzyme assays corroborated the Northern data and confirmed that the cytokines inhibit IAP induction. Transient transfections with a reporter plasmid carrying the human IAP promoter showed significant inhibition of NaBu-induced IAP gene activation by the cytokines (100 and 60% inhibition with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, respectively). Western analyses showed that NaBu induced H4 and H3 histone acetylation, and pretreatment with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha did not change this global acetylation pattern. In contrast, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that local histone acetylation of the IAP promoter region was specifically inhibited by either cytokine. We conclude that IL-1beta and TNF-alpha inhibit NaBu-induced IAP gene expression, likely by blocking the histone acetylation within its promoter. Cytokine-mediated IAP gene silencing may have important implications for gut epithelial function in the setting of intestinal inflammatory conditions.},

  abstract = {An adjuvant is a chemical incorporated into vaccines that enhances their efficacy by improving the immune response. Identifying adjuvant names from cancer vaccine studies is essential for furthering research and enhancing immunotherapies. However, the manual curation from the constantly expanding biomedical literature poses significant challenges. This study explores the automated recognition of vaccine adjuvant names using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) and Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama). We utilized two datasets: 97 clinical trial records from AdjuvareDB and 290 PubMed abstracts annotated with the Vaccine Adjuvant Compendium (VAC). Two LLMs, GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 were employed in zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms with up to four examples per prompt. Prompts explicitly targeted adjuvant names, testing the impact of contextual information such as substances or interventions. Outputs underwent automated and manual validation for accuracy and consistency. GPT-4o consistently attained 100% Precision across all situations, while also exhibiting notable enhancements in Recall and F1-scores, particularly with the incorporation of interventions. On the VAC dataset, GPT-4o achieved a maximum F1-score of 77.32% with interventions, surpassing Llama-3.2-3B by approximately 2%. On the AdjuvareDB dataset, GPT-4o reached an F1-score of 81.67% for three-shot prompting with interventions, surpassing Llama-3.2-3B's maximum F1-score of 65.62%. These results highlight the critical role of contextual information in enhancing model performance, with GPT-4o demonstrating a superior ability to leverage this enrichment. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at accurately identifying adjuvant names, including rare and novel variations of naming representation. This study emphasizes the capability of LLMs to enhance cancer vaccine development by efficiently extracting insights from clinical trial data. Future work aims to broaden the framework to encompass a wider array of biomedical literature and enhance model generalizability across various vaccines and adjuvants.

Since granule exocytosis from neutrophils is regulated by ion fluxes, we examined the effect of protein I on neutrophil activation. Pretreatment with protein I (250 nM) impaired degranulation from neutrophils: beta-glucuronidase release decreased to 27 +/- 6% S.E. of cells treated with N-f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP, 0.1 microM) and to 13 +/- 4% of cells treated with leukotriene B4 (LTB4, 0.1 microM); lysozyme release decreased to 52 +/- 17% of fMLP-treated cells and 22 +/- 9% of LTB4-treated cells. Morphometric analysis was consistent: control neutrophils increased their surface membrane after fMLP (43.3 +/- 5.6 microns relative perimeter versus 71.4 +/- 3.7 microns) while protein I-treated neutrophils did not (29.4 +/- 2 (S.E.) microns relative perimeter versus 34 +/- 4 microns). Enzyme release after exposure to phorbol myristate acetate was not affected (lysozyme: 86 +/- 27% of control). Cell/cell aggregation in response to fMLP was inhibited by treatment with protein I. However, generation of O2 was not affected. Protein I altered the surface membrane potential (Oxonol V): protein I evoked a transient membrane hyperpolarization which was not inhibited by furosemide. After exposure to fMLP, protein I-treated neutrophils underwent a furosemide-sensitive hyperpolarization rather than the usual depolarization. Protein I did not alter increments in [Ca]i (Fura-2) stimulated by fMLP (460 +/- 99 nM (S.E.) versus 377 +/- 44 nM) nor decrements in [pH]i (7.22 +/- 0.04 S.E. versus 7.22 +/- 0.02, bis-(carboxy-ethyl)carboxyfluorescein). The results suggest that degranulation and O2 generation have separate ionic requirements and that protein I interrupts the activation sequence proximal to activation of protein kinase C.},

Each of 36 athletes with shoulder pain aggravated by abduction and external rotation was examined in a single visit during which conventional radiography, arthrography, CT arthrography, and MR arthrography were performed. In 17 of these athletes, imaging findings were compared with those at arthroscopy. All images were independently evaluated by two groups of musculoskeletal radiologists. Structures found to be affected were, in decreasing order of frequency, the following: the posterosuperior labrum, supraspinatus tendon, infraspinatus tendon, humeral head, glenoid cavity and rim, acromioclavicular joint, anteroinferior capsulolabral complex, biceps tendon, and subscapularis tendon. MR arthrography without and with abduction and external rotation yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity for all lesions with the exceptions of bone sclerosis and enthesophytes (which were best seen with CT arthrography). MR arthrography with abduction and external rotation was most accurate for diagnosis of rotator cuff and anteroinferior capsulolabral complex tears. On the basis of these preliminary results, we believe that MR arthrography with abduction and external rotation should be part of the imaging evaluation of shoulder pain in throwing athletes, owing to the high sensitivity of this imaging technique.},

Outcome indicators include: Services utilized (emergency services, re-hospitalization), physiological status (catheter indwelling status, consciousness level, wound severity-number and wound stages) and functional status (reflected by Barthel Index). A prospective research design was used to collect the results. Five hospital-based HHNAs were invited to participate in this research. Clients newly admitted to HHNAs and diagnosed as non-cancer patients were recruited, and the researchers gathered outcome indicators over a six-month period. Data were analyzed using SPSS 8.0 computer software. There were 75 clients in this study. Results showed that most of the clients (64.0%) received service for more than 180 days. The client characteristics were dominated by elderly (66.6% age above 70), female (53.3%) and married (74.7%). The three leading care needs were NG tubing service (84.0%), Foley tubing service (45.3%) and wound care (38.7%). The Kruscal Wallis Test revealed that there was no difference in emergency service frequency and re-hospitalization between clients who received service for more than 180 days and those who received service for less than 180 days. The Wilcoxon Sign rank test showed that within one half-year, catheter indwelling status, functional status, and wound severity were not significantly different, with the exception only of conscious level (p = .001). The results of this study can be viewed as preliminary data to assist in shaping home health nursing services in Taiwan.},

Ideally, the endpoint metric should be an objective comparison of the trainee-acquired image with a reference ideal image. Therefore, we developed a simulator-based methodology of preclinical verification of proficiency (VOP) in trainees by tracking objective evaluation of the final acquired images. We utilized geometric data from the simulator probes to compare image acquisition of anesthesia residents who participated in our structured longitudinal simulator-based TEE educational program vs ideal image planes determined from a panel of experts. Thirty-three participants completed the study (15 experts, 7 postgraduate year (PGY)-1 and 11 PGY-4). The results of our study demonstrated a significant difference in image capture success rates between learners and experts (χ2 = 14.716, df = 2, P < 0.001) with the difference between learners (PGY-1 and PGY-4) not being statistically significant (χ2 = 0, df = 1, P = 1.000). Therefore, our results suggest that novices (i.e. PGY-1 residents) are capable of attaining a level of proficiency comparable to those with modest training (i.e. PGY-4 residents) after completion of a simulation-based training curriculum. However, professionals with years of clinical training (i.e. attending physicians) exhibit a superior mastery of such skills. It is hence feasible to develop a simulator-based VOP program in performance of TEE for junior anesthesia residents.},

Diagnostic MR features of deltoid muscle contracture include fibrotic cord in the deltoid muscle, especially its middle portion, extending from the superior acromial surface to the deltoid tuberosity, and winging of the scapula (increased winging angle of the scapula). Characteristic radiographic features include abduction contracture, winging of the scapula, lateral down-sloping of the acromial process, and a superior acromial enthesophyte.

Materials and Methods Cases selected from a radiology textbook series spanning a variety of imaging modalities, subspecialties, and anatomic pathologies were converted into standardized prompts that were entered into ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 algorithms; April 3 to June 1, 2023). Responses were analyzed for accuracy via comparison with the final diagnosis and top 3 differential diagnosis provided in the textbook, which served as the ground truth. Reliability, defined based on the frequency of algorithmic hallucination, was assessed through the identification of factually incorrect statements and fabricated references. Comparisons were made between the algorithms using the McNemar test and a generalized estimating equation model framework.

  abstract = {This review explores the current landscape of AI applications in imaging for TAVR, emphasizing the potential and limitations of these tools for (1) automating the image analysis and reporting process, (2) improving procedural planning, and (3) offering additional insight into post-TAVR outcomes. Finally, the direction of future research necessary to bridge these tools towards clinical integration is discussed. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a pivotal treatment option for select patients with severe aortic stenosis, and its indication for use continues to broaden. Noninvasive imaging techniques such as CTA and MRA have become routine for patient selection, preprocedural planning, and predicting the risk of complications. As the current methods for pre-TAVR image analysis are labor-intensive and have significant inter-operator variability, experts are looking towards artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution. AI has the potential to significantly enhance the planning, execution, and post-procedural follow up of TAVR. While AI tools are promising, the irreplaceable value of nuanced clinical judgment by skilled physician teams must not be overlooked. With continued research, collaboration, and careful implementation, AI can become an integral part in imaging for TAVR, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.},

This study aims to assess the multimodal capabilities of contemporary large language models, which allow analysis of image inputs in addition to textual data, on radiology board-style examination questions with images. 280 questions were retrospectively selected from the AuntMinnie public test bank. The test questions were converted into three formats of prompts; (1) Multimodal, (2) Image-only, and (3) Text-only input. Three models, GPT-4V, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, were evaluated using these prompts. The Cochran Q test and pairwise McNemar test were used to compare performances between prompt formats and models. No difference was found for the performance in terms of % correct answers between the text, image, and multimodal prompt formats for GPT-4V (54%, 52%, and 57%, respectively; p = .31) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (53%, 54%, and 57%, respectively; p = .53). For Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the image input (48%) significantly underperformed compared to the text input (63%, p < .001) and the multimodal input (66%, p < .001), but no difference was found between the text and multimodal inputs (p = .29). Claude significantly outperformed GPT and Gemini in the text and multimodal formats (p < .01). Vision-capable large language models cannot effectively use images to increase performance on radiology board-style examination questions. When using textual data alone, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Pro, highlighting the advancements in the field and its potential for use in further research.},

The GRIP-COMPASS study was a prospective double-blinded interventional study in 910 patients after cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valvular surgery). Patients were assigned to either the normal-low potassium target (nLP group, 4.0 mmol/L) or the normal-high potassium target (nHP group, 4.5 mmol/L) in alternating blocks of 50 patients. Potassium levels were regulated using a validated computer-assisted potassium replacement protocol (GRIP-II). The primary end point was the incidence of AF/AFL on a 12-lead electrocardiogram during the first postoperative week. Of the 910 patients, 447 were assigned to the nLP group; and 463, to the nHP group, with no baseline differences between the 2 groups. The mean daily administered dose of potassium was 30 ± 23 mmol (nLP) versus 52 ± 27 mmol (nHP) (P < .001), which resulted in mean intensive care unit potassium concentration of 4.22 ± 0.36 mmol/L and 4.33 ± 0.34 mmol/L, respectively (P < .001). The incidence of AF/AFL after cardiac surgery did not differ: 38% in the nLP group and 41% in the nHP group. Also in several subgroups (eg, patients not known with prior AF/AFL or with valve surgery), there were no differences. There were no differences in incidence of AF/AFL with 2 potassium regulation strategies with different potassium targets and different amounts of potassium administered in patients after cardiac surgery.},

We encountered a situation where the giant neck masses of a patient pushed the epiglottis posteriorly toward the posterior pharyngeal wall and compressed the laryngeal aperture narrowing after anesthetic induction, causing direct laryngoscopic intubation and sequential fiber-optic intubation failed. The neck masses twisted the aryepiglottic fold tortuously and clogged the laryngeal aperture tightly, making a flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope unable to pass through the laryngeal aperture. Later, we utilized a McCoy laryngoscope alternately to lift the compressed larynx up and away from the posterior pharyngeal wall, creating a passage and completing endotracheal intubation successfully with the aid of a gum elastic bougie. Our case suggested that the tilting tip blade of the McCoy laryngoscope could lever the tongue base up against the tumor mass compression to improve laryngeal views and facilitate endotracheal intubation when a difficult fiber-optic intubation was encountered on a compressed laryngeal aperture.},

While the concept of child abuse and related factors have been widely explored in interdisciplinary studies, a definition of 'child abuse' that is both precise and consistent has yet to be given. Lack of such limits the ability of clinicians to identify child abuse in clinical settings, and creates difficulties in conducting rigorous scientific research studies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to analyze the concept of child abuse based on literature published between 1960 and 2008 (n = 32) using Walker and Avant's concept analysis model in which child abuse is determined along two dimensions. These dimensions include the objective physical dimension, which addresses children younger than 20 years of age who experience repeated injuries or whose history of injury is incompatible with the findings of physical examinations, and the subjective psychological dimension, which addresses children who were treated unfairly or malevolently and their subsequent subjective feelings. Antecedents consist of abuser, victim, and environmental characteristics. Consequences include both physical and psychological aspects. Nurses and other professionals should benefit from a clearer definition of child abuse in their clinical and research settings.},

Our study shows that the electrokinetic energy conversion performance (maximum efficiency, pressure rise and streaming potential) are approximately identical for 1:1 (KCl), 2:1 (CaCl2) and 3:1 (LaCl3) electrolytes when capillary is positively charged. For negatively charged capillary, energy conversion performance degrades significantly with the increase of counter-ion valence. For both positively and negatively charged capillaries, higher maximum efficiency can be resulted in low bulk concentration and surface charge density regimes. However, high maximum pressure rise generation for the pumping is found in the low bulk concentration and high surface charge density regimes. For the electric power generation, higher maximum streaming potential is found when both bulk concentration and surface charge density are low.},

Built environment design is recognized as important in the care and management of responsive behaviors for those living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in secured dementia care units (e.g., exiting attempts, agitation). The repetitious behavior of "walking with purpose" (previously termed wandering) in those with dementia has influenced safety-related architectural design components of dementia care units that decrease exiting attempts. Empirical literature addressing design interventions to prevent exiting for those with dementia is lacking and outdated. We sought to describe known design techniques through a topical analysis of experimental studies. A thorough search for empirical studies that assessed interior design interventions at exit doors within dementia care units was undertaken. The review included an extensive search for existing literature and a screening of each study identified for its relevance, quality, and applicability. The experimental studies included in the review collectively assessed five interior design interventions at egress doorways: implementing horizontal and vertical floor grid patterns, mirrors, murals, conditioning responses to color cues, and camouflaging door hardware or vision panels. Why empirical studies have not continued more recently as built environment trends have shifted toward promoting meaningful and purposeful movement through design are considered. Advances in our understanding around the pathophysiology of dementia which might affect future design interventions related to egress are also identified. The built environment is an important part of dementia care, and further prospective research is needed on the role of design interventions in the context of exiting attempts within secured units and subsequent behavior outcomes.},

It can occur in a balanced or unbalanced form and as a sole abnormality is associated with an intermediate prognosis. Additionally, this translocation is observed in the context of hyperdiploid B-ALL, in which case it is associated with a poor prognosis. However, due to different translocation partner genes at chromosomes 1 and 19, distinct subtypes of hyperdiploid B-ALL with t(1;19)/der(19)t(1;19) are recognized based on the presence or absence of the TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene, but the cytogenetic and etiologic differences between the two remain understudied. We report a case of an adult with a history of relapsed precursor B-ALL whose conventional cytogenetics showed an abnormal female karyotype with both hyperdiploidy and a t(1;19)(q23;p13). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on previously G-banded metaphases using the LSI TCF3/PBX1 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe confirmed the presence of the TCF3-PBX1 gene fusion. This particular pattern with a TCF3-PBX1 fusion within the context of a hyperdiploid karyotype is seen in B-ALL and is usually associated with a poor outcome. This case is one of only a few cases with both hyperdiploidy and a confirmed TCF3-PBX1 fusion, demonstrating the importance of using FISH for proper molecular classification of these cases in order to distinguish them from those with hyperdiploidy but no TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene. Such molecular studies may provide insight into the precise differences between TCF3-PBX1 positive and negative hyperdiploid B-ALL bearing the t(1;19)(q23;p13).},

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes, used in Western countries since 1980, have not been readily used in Taiwanese long-term care facilities since their introduction in 1995. Instead, nasogastric tubes are used for extended periods. The reasons for limited percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use among long-term care residents are unknown. A phenomenologic qualitative design using in-depth semi-structured interviews collected the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use experiences of directors of long-term care facilities. The directors also provided descriptive data on the prevalence of feeding tubes among their residents. Eight directors of long-term care facilities in southern Taiwan participated in tape-recorded interviews. Data were thematically analysed using the methods of Strauss and Corbin. Feeding tube prevalence data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Four themes emerged as contributing to limited percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use in long-term care facilities: acceptability, availability, affordability and accountability. Over one-third of the residents required feeding tubes with 97% of those having nasogastric tube. Nasogastric tubes were used for a year or more in over half of the patients requiring enteral feeding. Chinese cultural values play a significant role in influencing end-of-life care and decisions about percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use. Nursing directors in long-term care assume a gatekeeper role to promote acceptability, provide availability and ensure accountability of nutritional interventions. Policy makers must be engaged to promote the affordability of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use among long-term care residents. To improve nutritional outcomes among long-term care residents, nurses must acknowledge the Chinese culture related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes. Professionals must provide sufficient information about the advantages of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and discuss with families the meaning of quality of life and suffering at the end-of-life.},

In this work, we investigate the motivations underlying EBEPs as a function of moral values. Specifically, we propose EBEPs may often be best understood as morally motivated behaviors grounded in people's moral values and perceptions of moral violations. As evidence, we report five studies that integrate spatial modeling and experimental methods to investigate the relationship between moral values and EBEPs. Our results, from these U.S. based studies, suggest that moral values oriented around group preservation are predictive of the county-level prevalence of hate groups and associated with the belief that extreme behavioral expressions of prejudice against marginalized groups are justified. Additional analyses suggest that the association between group-based moral values and EBEPs against outgroups can be partly explained by the belief that these groups have done something morally wrong.},

Shorter time to administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with improved outcomes, but early recognition of sepsis remains a major challenge. In a two-center cohort study with prospective sample collection from 1400 adult patients in emergency departments suspected of sepsis, we sought to determine the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of a machine-learning algorithm based on clinical data and a set of uncommonly measured biomarkers. Specifically, we demonstrate that a machine-learning model developed using this dataset outputs a score with not only diagnostic capability but also prognostic power with respect to hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day mortality, and 3-day inpatient re-admission both in our entire testing cohort and various subpopulations. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for diagnosis of sepsis was 0.83. Predicted risk scores for patients with septic shock were higher compared with patients with sepsis but without shock (p < 0.0001). Scores for patients with infection and organ dysfunction were higher compared with those without either condition (p < 0.0001). Stratification based on predicted scores of the patients into low, medium, and high-risk groups showed significant differences in LOS (p < 0.0001), 30-day mortality (p < 0.0001), and 30-day inpatient readmission (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, a machine-learning algorithm based on electronic medical record (EMR) data and three nonroutinely measured biomarkers demonstrated good diagnostic and prognostic capability at the time of initial blood culture.},

In this study, we used real-time 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to analyze geometric changes in multiple axes of the TA throughout the cardiac cycle in patients without right ventricular abnormalities. R-wave-gated 3D TEE images of the TA were acquired in 39 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The patients with abnormal right ventricular/tricuspid structure or function were excluded from the study. For each patient, eight points along the TA were traced in the 3D dataset and used to reconstruct the TA at four stages of the cardiac cycle (end- and mid-systole, end- and mid-diastole). Statistical analyses were applied to determine whether TA area, perimeter, axes, and planarity changed significantly over each stage of the cardiac cycle. TA area (P = 0.012) and perimeter (P = 0.024) both changed significantly over the cardiac cycle. Of all the axes, only the posterolateral-anteroseptal demonstrated significant dynamism (P < 0.001). There was also a significant displacement in the vertical axis between the points and the regression plane in end-systole (P < 0.001), mid-diastole (P = 0.014), and mid-systole (P < 0.001).

Three-dimensional R-wave gated, full-volume transesophageal echocardiography images were obtained after deployment of the MitraClip device. A high-quality diastolic frame of the mitral valve was segmented using Mimics Innovation Suite and merged with a flange. The data were exported as a stereolithography (.stl) file, and a rigid 3-dimensional model was printed using a MakerBot Replicator 2 printer. A flexible silicone cast then was created and deployed in the pulse-duplicator chamber filled with a blood-mimicking fluid. The authors were able to obtain continuous-wave Doppler tracings of the valve inflow with a transesophageal echocardiography transducer. They also were able to generate diastolic ventricular and atrial pressure tracings. Pressure half-time and mitral valve area were computed from these measurements. This pulse duplicator shows promising applications in hemodynamic testing of patient-specific anatomy. Future modifications to the system may allow for visualization and data collection of gradients across the aortic valve.},

Reduced expression of this gene and of its encoded protein, dysbindin-1, have been reported in the brains of schizophrenia cases. It has not been established, however, if the protein reductions encompass all dysbindin-1 isoforms or if they are associated with decreased DTNBP1 gene expression. Using a matched pairs design in which each of 28 Caucasian schizophrenia cases was matched in age and sex to a normal Caucasian control, Western blotting of whole-tissue lysates of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) revealed significant reductions in dysbindin-1C (but not in dysbindin-1A or -1B) in schizophrenia (P = 0.022). These reductions occurred without any significant change in levels of the encoding transcript in the same tissue samples and in the absence of the only DTNBP1 risk haplotype for schizophrenia reported in the USA. Indeed, no significant correlations were found between case-control differences in any dysbindin-1 isoform and the case-control differences in its encoding mRNA. Consequently, the mean 60% decrease in dysbindin-1C observed in 71% of our case-control pairs appears to reflect abnormalities in mRNA translation and/or processes promoting dysbindin-1C degradation (e.g. oxidative stress, phosphorylation and/or ubiquitination). Given the predominantly post-synaptic localization of dysbindin-1C and known post-synaptic effects of dysbindin-1 reductions in the rodent equivalent of the DLPFC, the present findings suggest that decreased dysbindin-1C in the DLPFC may contribute to the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia by promoting NMDA receptor hypofunction in fast-spiking interneurons.},

The subsequent resection and pathology revealed intraosseous tophus deposition, which is particularly rare at this site and at this age. Imaging studies revealed some characteristic imaging features which can retrospectively be attributed to gouty tophus. When an expansile osteolytic lesion manifesting low signal intensity on T2-weighted image and internal calcifications on CT scan is encountered, the possibility of intraosseous tophus should be included in the list of differential diagnoses, even in a teenage patient without prior history of gout.},

Previous studies show that students who struggle with the identification and segmentation of speech sounds are more likely to encounter difficulties with clinical phonetic transcription. To clarify the connection between phonemic awareness and phonetic transcription in Mandarin-speaking undergraduate students, as well as the improvement of these skills after phonetic transcription training. A pretest-post-test design was adopted for this study. The experimental group (n = 38) consisted of students majoring in audiology and speech-language pathology who were given 12 weeks of transcription training. The control group (n = 33) consisted of audiology and speech-language pathology majors who completed the same module a year earlier without undergoing the transcription training. Two instruments were used to assess their skills: (1) the Phonemic Awareness Skill Test (PA test) and (2) the Phonetic Transcription Skill Test (PT test) designed for the purposes of the present study. Performance on most subtests of the PT and PA tests improved significantly at post-test for the experiment group, although only PT training was provided. After phonetic transcription training, the relationship between phonemic addition abilities and phonetic transcription strengthened. Phonemic identification was found to be a predictor of undergraduate students' PT skills of disordered speech samples. Results from this study provide insights into the role of phonetic transcription training in improving phonemic awareness and phonetic transcription skills. What is already known on the subject Phonetic transcription of disordered speech samples is especially crucial for the assessment and treatment of functional or organic speech-sound disorders. Phonemic awareness is not only an essential ability for reading alphabetic language but also associated with acquiring phonetic transcription skills. What this paper adds to existing knowledge A dynamically changing association between phonemic transcription and phonetic transcription during transcription training was reported. Phonetic transcription training of disordered speech samples acted as a driving force for deeper relationships between the two skills. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Training phonetic recognition and transcription equips future and practising speech-language pathologists with better skills in managing speech-sound disorders. Implications for phonemic awareness training also have the potential to extend to the literacy skills of alphabetic language speakers.},

Twenty-four sets of images of cadaveric joints were evaluated independently by two observers. These sets consisted of MR arthrographic images obtained with traction (applied to the wrist using 1- to 3-kg weights) and without traction in five shoulders in which SLAP lesions had been excluded arthroscopically or by cadaveric sectioning; and MR arthrographic images obtained with and without traction in seven shoulders in which various types of SLAP lesions had been created arthroscopically and later confirmed by cadaveric sectioning. Analysis of the data indicated that MR arthrography in combination with arm traction and external rotation improved diagnostic accuracy with regard to identification and categorization of SLAP lesions when compared with studies made without traction. The combination of MR arthrography and arm traction with the shoulder in external rotation provides a more effective approach for detection of SLAP lesions than does similar MR arthrography performed without arm traction.},

These transcripts, designated L/S junction-spanning transcripts (L/STs), are synthesized in abundance in a variety of cells infected with mutant viruses defective in the gene for ICP4, the major transcriptional regulatory protein of the virus. Transcription of abundant 2.3- and 8.5-kb series of L/STs was shown to initiate within the same sequences as less abundant 4.2-, 7.3-, and > 9.5-kb transcripts by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. S1 nuclease analysis revealed a single 5' terminus 28 bp downstream of a TATA box and 6 bp downstream of a consensus ICP4 binding site. The location of the transcriptional start site indicates that the promoter of the L/STs likely corresponds to the bidirectional promoter described by Bohenzky et al. (R. A. Bohenzky, A. G. Papavassiliou, I. H. Gelman, and S. Silverstein, J. Virol. 67:632-642, 1993). The L/STs accumulate with late kinetics in ICP4 mutant-infected cells and are polyadenylated. Mutant viruses encoding forms of ICP4 unable to bind the consensus site, ATCGTC, exhibited abundant expression of the L/STs, whereas mutants encoding forms of ICP4 able to bind this site expressed no detectable L/STs, suggesting that ICP4 plays a critical role in repressing L/ST expression. Their synthesis in ICP4 mutant-infected cells is inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating that they are induced either by an immediate-early viral protein other than ICP4 or by a virus-induced cellular protein. Preliminary evidence indicates that the L/STs are not present in latently infected ganglia. The abundant expression of the L/STs with late kinetics only in the absence of functional ICP4 and the sensitivity of their synthesis to cycloheximide indicate that they are not members of any of the recognized kinetic classes of herpes simplex virus type 1 transcripts but constitute a new class of viral transcript.},

Coronal imaging allowed complete visualization of the calcaneofibular, posterior talofibular, tibiocalcaneal, and posterior tibiotalar ligaments. In both imaging planes, differentiation of the deep and superficial layers of the medial collateral ligament was possible. Differentiation between the syndesmotic complex and the lateral collateral ligament was accomplished easily; in particular, differentiation of the posterior tibiofibular ligament from the posterior talofibular ligament was not difficult because of the differing insertions of these ligaments. The inhomogeneous appearance of the medial collateral ligament and the posterior talofibular ligament on MR images correlated with areas of fatty tissue on corresponding microscopic sections.

Whereas it implies chronicity, it lacks specificity in discriminating normal from a significantly remodeled MV apparatus. Regional aspects of MV remodeling have shown superior value over global remodeling in predicting recurrence after MV repair for IMR. Quite possibly, presence of specific regional changes in MV geometry that are unique to chronic IMR patients could also be used to diagnose the presence and track progression of remodeling. Knowledge of these changes in MV apparatus in patients with IMR can possibly be used to identify patients for surgical intervention before irreversible remodeling occurs. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiographic data were collected from patients who underwent MV surgery for IMR (IMR group, n = 66), and from patients with normal valvular and biventricular function (control group, n = 10). The acquired data of the MV were geometrically analyzed to make regional comparisons between the IMR and the control group to identify measurements that reliably differentiate normal from remodeled MVs. Lengthening of the middle potion of the anterior annulus (A2 regional perimeter: 11.149 mm versus 9.798 mm, p = 0.0041), larger nonplanarity angle (147.985 versus 140.720 degrees, p = 0.0459), and increased tenting angle of the posteromedial scallop of the posterior leaflet (P3 tenting angle: 44.354 versus 40.461 degrees, p = 0.0435) were sufficient in differentiating between IMR and the control group. Specific three-dimensional changes in MV geometry can be used to reliably identify a significantly remodeled valve apparatus.},

Allergic contact dermatitis to potties, metal toys, and children's jewelry is well known, however, there is a broad range of skin risks in toys. With the objective to identify and publicize the associated risk of contact dermatitis in children's toys, we have searched the PubMed database from creation to September 9, 2019. Studies were eligible if they reported a new case of contact dermatitis secondary to interaction with a toy in patients from birth to 18 years of age. A toy was defined as something children interact with for entertainment during leisure time. In this review of the PubMed database we filtered by age and language which may have prevented us from detecting cases in adults that could be extrapolated to children. In addition, several articles were excluded based on title alone. A total of 1312 articles were identified and reviewed manually for inclusion criteria. Review of the articles found 25 original articles for consideration. Several toys were found to be associated with contact dermatitis. These included electronics, toy cars, costume jewelry, bicycles, sqwish balls, slime, Play-Doh, and plasticine. Electronics such as video game controllers, cellphones, iPads, and computers were implicated. In conclusion, there is still an unmet need for observation of this segment of industry for labeling of contents and ongoing surveillance.},

HCV-specific antibodies (anti-HCV Ab) in blood specimens were tested for HCV seropositive by the third-generation HCV ELISA system. The subjects, later identified as 152 seropositive and 88 seronegative, were selected for analysis of the correlates of HCV infection. They were interviewed to explore a variety of possible risk factors for HCV infection with a structured questionnaire. The results showed that the anti-HCV age-adjusted seroprevalence was 55.8%. Needle injection was significant to the increased anti-HCV seroprevalence, with multivariate age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of 1.9 and 1.2-3.9 respectively. This study identifies Ma-Sha-Gou as an endemic area of HCV infection, in which needle injection from any medical activity was a possible transmission pathway in the village, and suggests the health authorities/community health nurses should give the residents a comprehensive community-based education program to interrupt HCV transmission.},

An oval mass with low signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images posterior to the PCL, simulating a PCL ganglion cyst, was seen in all 10 patients. A tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus was also seen in all patients. The sites of communication between the cyst and meniscal tear were observed in sagittal MR images in eight patients. Septation within the cyst and associated joint effusion were seen in eight and four patients, respectively. Arthroscopy in eight patients and transmeniscal needle drainage in the other two patients confirmed both the meniscal tear and the pericruciate meniscal cyst. Pericruciate meniscal cysts cause fluid collections posterior to the PCL, simulating a PCL ganglion cyst. Careful analysis of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus should be performed when a cyst-like structure is seen adjacent to the PCL.},

We did so by regulating expression of MutL homologue MLH 1, which is essential in mismatch repair, in a kidney cell line that had been transduced by an AID-containing vector. Whether or not MLH1 was expressed, we found no difference in the mutation rates of an indicator gene. We conclude that in order to contribute to hypermutation, mismatch repair needs additional factors that are present in activated B lymphocytes, but absent in the cell line investigated.},

The relationships between the environmental factors and CDIs were analysed in a hybrid within- and between-hospital random-effect model.

All inpatients in 129 general hospital trusts of the NHS in the years 2011-2019, covering 120,629 cases of CDI. Annual number of CDIs per hospital trust. Single rooms were associated with fewer CDIs at the within-hospital level, but not at the between-hospital level. Similarly, more nursing staff was associated with fewer CDIs at the within-hospital level, but not at the between-hospital level. This effect was not observed for physician staffing. A different picture emerged for the protective effect of cultural resources, with a weakly significant effect of between-hospital differences, but no within-hospital effect. Financial resources were not associated with CDIs either between hospitals or within them over time. The present study identified hospital resources with a beneficial influence on CDI rates. Healthcare organizations can use this knowledge for active CDI prevention.},

The semiotic framework of Peirce's Universal Categories (UCs) laid ground for a novel cognitive-semiotic typology of social interactions. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 16 volunteers watched a movie narrative encompassing verbal and non-verbal social interactions. Three types of non-verbal interactions were coded ("unresolved," "non-habitual," and "habitual") based on a typology reflecting Peirce's UCs. As expected, the auditory cortex responded to verbal interactions, but non-verbal interactions modulated temporal areas as well. Conceivably, when speech was lacking, ambiguous visual information (unresolved interactions) primed auditory processing in contrast to learned behavioral patterns (habitual interactions). The latter recruited a parahippocampal-occipital network supporting conceptual processing and associative memory retrieval. Requesting semiotic contextualization, non-habitual interactions activated visuo-spatial and contextual rule-learning areas such as the temporo-parietal junction and right lateral prefrontal cortex. In summary, the cognitive-semiotic typology reflected distinct sensory and association networks underlying the interpretation of observed non-verbal social interactions.},

Flow theory is a well-established model developed to describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii) direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and motivational processes during media entertainment.},

However, reliable and consistent findings have not been reported yet. Several methodological factors might be responsible for the discrepant findings, including the heterogeneity of patient samples in terms of symptom severity. In the current study, we combined investigations of the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of BPD patients with seed-based connectivity measures and then computed the correlation of connectivity measures with borderline symptom severity. Correlation-based connectivity analysis was performed on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 26 female BPD patients and 26 healthy controls. Increased intrinsic connectivity was found in clusters involving part of the caudate nucleus and the left insula in the patient group, indicating greater integration of each region. Further seed-based connectivity analyses revealed that with the caudate seed, the patient data exhibited an increased resting-state functional connectivity in the bilateral ventral striatum and the midline prefrontal regions extending to the ACC, a network associated with reward processing. The left insula seed showed significantly increased connectivity with the bilateral fronto-orbital/insula, the inferior parietal lobule and the mid-cingulate cortex, a network involved in attention and salience encoding, in the patient population. Moreover, symptom severity, as assessed with the BSL-95 outside the scanner, was negatively correlated with the coupling of the insula and the striatum in the BPD group. Overall, an increased functional connectivity within two large-scale circuitries underlying reward and salience processing was evident in patients, as compared to healthy participants. When correlated with borderline symptom severity, a reduced connectivity between key regions belonging to the reward system and salience network was observed in the patients. These findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the BPD pathophysiology and thereby delineate potential treatment targets.},

Attention deployment (AD) and cognitive reappraisal (CR) are both efficient cognitive ER strategies, which are based on partially dissociated neural effects. Our understanding of the neural underpinnings of ER is based on laboratory paradigms that study changes of the brain activation related to isolated emotional stimuli. To track the neural response to ER in the changing and dynamic environment of daily life, we extended the common existing paradigms by applying a sequence of emotionally provocative stimuli involving three aversive images. Eighteen participants completed an ER paradigm, in which they had to either shift their attention away from the emotionally negative images by counting backwards (AD strategy) or reinterpret the meaning of stimuli (CR strategy) to attain a down-regulation of affective responses. An increased recruitment of left-sided lateral and medial PFC was shown upon regulation of negative emotions with CR as compared to AD. Remarkably, the amygdala activation showed an increasing pattern of activation during CR. The inverse relationship between PFC and amygdala was compromised during elongated blocks of reappraisal, reflecting a reduction in engagement of the top-down prefrontal regulatory circuitry upon repeated exposure to negative stimuli. These results highlight that temporal dynamic of amygdala response and its functional connectivity differentiates AD and CR strategies in regulating emotions. Findings of the current study underscore the importance of adopting temporally variant approaches for investigating the neural effects of ER. Identifying neural systems that subserve down-regulation of negative emotions is of importance in developing treatment strategies for various forms of psychopathology.},

In particular, studies indicate altered functional coupling between nodes of the language and default mode networks. Neurofeedback based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) can be used to modulate such aberrant network connectivity. We investigated resting-state connectivity changes after neurofeedback (NF) in 21 patients with schizophrenia and 35 healthy individuals. All participants underwent two days of neurofeedback training of important nodes of the left-hemispheric language network including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). In a double-blind randomized cross-over design, participants learned to down- and up-regulate their brain activation in the designated target regions based on NF. Prior to and after each training day, a resting state measurement took place. Coupling between nodes of the language and the default mode network (DMN) selectively increased after down-as compared to up-regulation NF. Network analyses revealed more pronounced increases in functional connectivity between nodes of the language network and the DMN in patients compared to healthy individuals. In particular, down-regulation NF led to increased coupling between nodes of the language network and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (IPL) as well as posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus in patients. Up-regulation strengthened connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Improved well-being four weeks after the training predicted increased functional coupling between the left IFG and left IPL. Modulatory effects emerged as increased internetwork communication, indicating that down-regulation NF selectively enhances coupling between language and DM network nodes in patients with AVH. RtfMRI NF may thus be used to modulate brain network function that is relevant to the phenomenology of AVH. Specific effects of self-regulation on symptom improvement have to be explored in therapeutic interventions.},

Implementing information from only one electrode, however, may miss relevant information from complex electrophysiological networks. Component based analysis, in turn, depends on a priori knowledge of the signal topography. Complex designs such as studies on multisensory integration of emotions investigate subtle differences in distributed networks based on only a few trials per condition. Thus, they require a sensitive and comprehensive approach which does not rely on a-priori knowledge about the underlying neural processes. In this pilot study, feasibility and sensitivity of source localization-driven analysis for EEG-fMRI was tested using a multisensory integration paradigm. Dynamic audiovisual stimuli consisting of emotional talking faces and pseudowords with emotional prosody were rated in a delayed response task. The trials comprised affectively congruent and incongruent displays. In addition to event-locked EEG and fMRI analyses, induced oscillatory EEG responses at estimated cortical sources and in specific temporo-spectral windows were correlated with the corresponding BOLD responses. EEG analysis showed high data quality with less than 10% trial rejection. In an early time window, alpha oscillations were suppressed in bilateral occipital cortices and fMRI analysis confirmed high data quality with reliable activation in auditory, visual and frontal areas to the presentation of multisensory stimuli. In line with previous studies, we obtained reliable correlation patterns for event locked occipital alpha suppression and BOLD signal time course. Our results suggest a valid methodological approach to investigate complex stimuli using the present source localization driven method for EEG-fMRI. This novel procedure may help to investigate combined EEG-fMRI data from novel complex paradigms with high spatial and temporal resolution.},

In the intervention arm, leading ICU personnel (physicians and nurses) will be trained in ICU Support and implement the ICU Support elements into the daily work routine of their units upon completion of data collection period T0 (baseline). In the control arm, ICU Support will not be implemented until the completion of the data collection period T1 (1 month after study start). Until then, the regular daily schedule of the ICU teams will be maintained. The final data collection period (T2) will take place 4 months after the start of the study. Primary outcomes include the number of intensive care complications per patient during their ICU stay during T1 and the sick-related absence of ICU staff during T1. Secondary outcomes include, among others, the average severity of intensive care complications per patient and employee self-reported data regarding their teamwork and patient safety behaviors. The need for healthy and well-trained ICU staff is omnipresent; thus, structured and evidence-based interventions aimed at supporting ICU teams and facilitating patient safety are required. This multicenter study aims to explore the effectiveness of ICU Support for patient- and staff-centered outcomes. The insights derived from this study have the potential to significantly improve ICU patient safety, staff communication, and connectedness and decrease sickness-related expenses and social costs associated with high work demands among ICU staff.

  abstract = {A gene-environment interaction between expression genotypes of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and adverse childhood experience increases the risk of antisocial behavior. However, the neural underpinnings of this interaction remain uninvestigated. A cortico-limbic circuit involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala is central to the suppression of aggressive impulses and is modulated by serotonin (5-HT). MAOA genotypes may modulate the vulnerability of this circuit and increase the risk for emotion regulation deficits after specific life events. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) challenges 5-HT regulation and may identify vulnerable neuronal circuits, contributing to the gene-environment interaction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging measured the resting-state state activity in 64 healthy males in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Cortical maps of amygdala correlation identified the impact of ATD and its interaction with low- (MAOA-L) and high-expression variants (MAOA-H) of MAOA on cortico-limbic connectivity. Across all Regions of Interest (ROIs) exhibiting an ATD effect on cortico-limbic connectivity, MAOA-L carriers were more susceptible to ATD than MAOA-H carriers. In particular, the MAOA-L group exhibited a larger reduction of amygdala connectivity with the right prefrontal cortex and a larger increase of amygdala connectivity with the insula and dorsal PCC. MAOA-L carriers were more susceptable to a central 5-HT challenge in cortico-limbic networks. Such vulnerability of the cortical serotonergic system may contribute to the emergence of antisocial behavior after systemic challenges, observed as gene-environment interaction.

It was demonstrated that playing a video game leads to striatal dopamine release. It is unclear, however, which aspects of the game cause this reward system activation and if violent content contributes to it. We combined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with individual affect measures to address the neuronal correlates of violence in a video game. Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during fMRI measurement. We defined success as eliminating opponents, and failure as being eliminated themselves. Affect was measured directly before and after game play using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Failure and success events evoked increased activity in visual cortex but only failure decreased activity in orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus. A negative correlation between negative affect and responses to failure was evident in the right temporal pole (rTP). The deactivation of the caudate nucleus during failure is in accordance with its role in reward-prediction error: it occurred whenever subject missed an expected reward (being eliminated rather than eliminating the opponent). We found no indication that violence events were directly rewarding for the players. We addressed subjective evaluations of affect change due to gameplay to study the reward system. Subjects reporting greater negative affect after playing the game had less rTP activity associated with failure. The rTP may therefore be involved in evaluating the failure events in a social context, to regulate the players' mood.},

Given the holistic nature of the spiral curriculum, we assumed that a purely digital model would have an impact on knowledge acquisition due to missing hands-on learning opportunities. The aim of the study was to investigate, using an emergency seminar as an example, whether purely digital training leads to a difference in theoretical knowledge compared to the traditional model. Study design: We used a two-groups design comparing a sample of medical students taught in 2020 with a purely digital teaching format (DF;  Students in the DF group scored significantly lower than students in the TF group in the final exams. Students in the DF group rated the course significantly worse than students in the TF group. The study results illustrate that purely digital education leads to inferior knowledge acquisition compared to the traditional spiral curriculum. A possible explanation may lie in a deeper processing of the information (e.g., understanding the information by experience and analysis) and accordingly a better memory recall. Moreover, the students' critical appraisal of the DF may have had an unfavorable effect on learning performance. Moderating factors may be lower learning motivation or the "zoom fatigue" effect. These study results clearly illustrate the importance of hands-on teaching for knowledge acquisition. The interlocking of theoretical knowledge and practical skills, as ensured by the spiral curriculum, is essential.},

This study investigates the differences in neural network activity during the playing of both versions of the video game. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded ongoing brain activity of 18 young men playing the violence-related and the non-violence-related version of the video game Carmageddon. Image time series were decomposed into functional connectivity (FC) patterns using independent component analysis (ICA) and template-matching yielded a mapping to established functional brain networks. The FC patterns revealed a decrease in connectivity within 6 brain networks during the violence-related compared to the non-violence-related condition: three sensory-motor networks, the reward network, the default mode network (DMN), and the right-lateralized frontoparietal network. Playing violent racing games may change functional brain connectivity, in particular and even after controlling for event frequency, in the reward network and the DMN. These changes may underlie the short-term increase of aggressive affects, cognitions, and behaviors as observed after playing violent video games.},

In a large-scale pilot project 265 medical students were trained for an ICU assignment. The innovative training module was accompanied by a pre-post questionnaire for self-assessment of the skills learned. 22 weeks after the training module and still during the pandemic deployment, another questionnaire was used to evaluate experiences in deployment and the efficiency of the training module with respect to preparation for ICU deployment. The analysis revealed significant mean differences for all COVID-19-specific variables (safety dimension) in favor of the training module (n = 168). The deployment evaluation showed that the training concept was inconsistently assessed as preparation for the work deployment for 69 of the 89 deployed students in total (53% agreement/47% disagreement). The results show a good feasibility of an innovative training concept for medical students with respect to a pandemic deployment as assistants in intensive care units. The concept is suitable for providing additional helpers in intensive care units during a pandemic; however, the inconsistent evaluation indicates that the concept can be expanded and needs to be adapted.},

For educators, there are often pragmatic reasons to decide for one or another of them, such as costs, infrastructural requirements, time expenditure or qualification of the teacher. However, a central aspect to consider is the learning outcome: Does a new method achieve a similar learning success as an established standard method? To answer this question, we need an appropriate method to assess comparability of learning outcomes. In this paper, we present two essential statistical concepts that can address the issue of comparability of learning outcomes: Equivalence and non-inferiority testing. We explain the ideas behind these concepts and illustrate them with an example data set. To clarify several concepts, we use theoretical examples from one selected field: the teaching and assessment of Basic Life Support (BLS). Equivalence and non-inferiority tests can be powerful tools for comparing teaching and assessment methods. However, their correct application requires adequate knowledge about their strengths, pitfalls and application fields. The aim of this paper is to deliver this knowledge and to provide clinician researchers with a practical guidance to a successful application of these methods.},

Altered transmission of the central nervous serotonin (5-HT) contributes to dysfunctions in the cognitive control of emotions. To date, studies relating to pharmaco-fMRI challenging of the 5-HT system have focused on emotion processing for facial expressions. We investigated effects of a single-dose selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) on emotion regulation during virtual violence. For this purpose, 38 male participants played a violent video game during fMRI scanning. The SSRI reduced neural responses to violent actions in right-hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex encompassing the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but not to non-violent actions. Within the ACC, the drug effect differentiated areas with high inhibitory 5-HT1A receptor density (subgenual s25) from those with a lower density (pregenual p32, p24). This finding links functional responses during virtual violent actions with 5-HT neurotransmission in emotion regulation networks, underpinning the ecological validity of the 5-HT model in aggressive behavior. Available 5-HT receptor density data suggest that this SSRI effect is only observable when inhibitory and excitatory 5-HT receptors are balanced. The observed early functional changes may impact patient groups receiving SSRI treatment.},

Therefore, an Impella for venting the LV was implanted. After 6 days of mechanical circulatory support, her heart function recovered. All support could be weaned, and 2 months later, she had made a full recovery.

In this randomized controlled noninferiority trial, 251 medical undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of two interventions (QIF n = 127; VAPF n = 124). In QIF, participants received feedback from a qualified instructor. In VAPF, participants video-recorded each other while performing a wound dressing and gave each other feedback assisted by a standardized checklist. Outcome measures were participants' score in an objective structured practical examination (OSPE) and a written exam after the course. Noninferiority of VAPF (n = 123) compared to QIF (n = 127) was confirmed for both OSPE (QIF: 8.83 ± 1.30; VAPF: 8.88 ± 1.04; mean difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.25) and written exam (QIF: 8.99 ± 1.06; VAPF: 9.14 ± 1.05; mean difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.12). VAPF is a cost-efficient and viable alternative to QIF commonly used in medical education. It provides comparable training outcomes to the traditional training method with lower personnel investment. VAPF is a promising educational method for improving essential clinical competencies.},

This study aimed to examine the role of error framing in basic life support (BLS) training for future healthcare professionals.

Significant equivalence was determined for all study arms with respect to CR and self-confidence. Our study revealed that EM was not detrimental to learners' CPR performance. Given existing research on long-term beneficial effects of EM on patient safety, coupled with the proven equivalence of EM and EA concerning short-term performance, we argue that EM is a promising approach for future medical education purposes.

  abstract = {Face-to-face communication is multimodal; it encompasses spoken words, facial expressions, gaze, and co-speech gestures. In contrast to linguistic symbols (e.g., spoken words or signs in sign language) relying on mostly explicit conventions, gestures vary in their degree of conventionality. Bodily signs may have a general accepted or conventionalized meaning (e.g., a head shake) or less so (e.g., self-grooming). We hypothesized that subjective perception of conventionality in co-speech gestures relies on the classical language network, i.e., the left hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Broca's area) and the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG, Wernicke's area) and studied 36 subjects watching video-recorded story retellings during a behavioral and an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. It is well documented that neural correlates of such naturalistic videos emerge as intersubject covariance (ISC) in fMRI even without involving a stimulus (model-free analysis). The subjects attended either to perceived conventionality or to a control condition (any hand movements or gesture-speech relations). Such tasks modulate ISC in contributing neural structures and thus we studied ISC changes to task demands in language networks. Indeed, the conventionality task significantly increased covariance of the button press time series and neuronal synchronization in the left IFG over the comparison with other tasks. In the left IFG, synchronous activity was observed during the conventionality task only. In contrast, the left pSTG exhibited correlated activation patterns during all conditions with an increase in the conventionality task at the trend level only. Conceivably, the left IFG can be considered a core region for the processing of perceived conventionality in co-speech gestures similar to spoken language. In general, the interpretation of conventionalized signs may rely on neural mechanisms that engage during language comprehension.},

Over the past years, a multitude of studies have addressed the question of how affective cues conveyed by auditory and visual channels are integrated. Behavioral studies show that hearing and seeing emotional expressions can support and influence each other, a notion which is supported by investigations on the underlying neurobiology. Numerous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions subserving the integration of multimodal emotions and have provided new insights into the neural processing steps underlying the synergistic confluence of affective information from voice and face. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review covering current behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging findings on the combination of emotions from the auditory and visual domains. Behavioral advantages arising from multimodal redundancy are paralleled by specific integration patterns on the neural level, from encoding in early sensory cortices to late cognitive evaluation in higher association areas. In summary, these findings indicate that bimodal emotions interact at multiple stages of the audiovisual integration process.},

This suggests an MAOA-L-specific neurobiological vulnerability associated with trait aggression. The neural networks underlying this vulnerability are unknown. The present study investigated genotype-specific associations between resting state brain networks and trait aggression (Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire) in 82 healthy Caucasian males. Genotype influences on aggression-related networks were studied for intrinsic and seed-based brain connectivity. Intrinsic connectivity was higher in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) of MAOA-L compared to high expressing allele (MAOA-H) carriers. Seed-based connectivity analyses revealed genotype differences in the functional involvement of this region. MAOA genotype modulated the relationship between trait aggression and VMPFC connectivity with supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and areas of the default mode network (DMN). Separate analyses for the two groups were performed to better understand how the genotype modulated the relationship between aggression and brain networks. They revealed a positive correlation between VMPFC connectivity and aggression in right angular gyrus (AG) and a negative correlation in right SMG in the MAOA-L group. No such effect emerged in the MAOA-H carriers. The results indicate a particular relevance of VMPFC for aggression in MAOA-L carriers; in specific, a detachment from the DMN along with a strengthened coupling to the AG seems to go along with lower trait aggression. MAOA-L carriers may thus depend on a synchronization of emotion regulation systems (VMPFC) with core areas of empathy (SMG) to prevent aggression.},

  abstract = {The recent expansion of studies on hypermutation may benefit from a fast and uncomplicated way to measure mutation rates. In this paper we compare different retroviral vector designs for monitoring hypermutation in vivo. Retroviral vectors combine a high transduction rate with integration at random sites within the host cell genome, thus equalizing positional effects on the reporter gene. The vectors contain a reporter gene with a premature TAG termination codon; upon reversion, a full-length fluorescent protein is expressed. Any single point mutation at the amber codon activates the reporter--except the transition from G to A, which only creates the stop codon TAA. In the construct, the reporter gene is followed by an internal ribosome entry site and a second marker that allows selection of stably transduced cells. As a reporter gene, we tested the green and yellow fluorescence proteins (GFP and YFP); and various proteins with red fluorescence (dsRed). The second marker was either a drug resistance gene, or a second fluorescent protein. We also introduced various cis-acting enhancer elements into the reporter construct, to study the simultaneous activity of enhancers on transcription and hypermutation. We found that GFP as a reporter, combined with a drug selection marker, gave the most consistent and convenient mutation rate measurements. DsRed is a good alternative to GFP, but variants with greater fluorescence intensity are needed when combined with green fluorescence measurements. We also confirm that no immunoglobulin specific sequence is needed to target hypermutation. Depending on their position in these ectopically expressed constructs, enhancers can have positive or negative effects on hypermutation.},

In particular, amygdala responsivity to negative stimuli is exaggerated while engagement of prefrontal regulatory control regions is attenuated. Successful application of emotion regulation (ER) strategies may counteract this disbalance, however, application of learned strategies in daily life is hampered in individuals afflicted by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized that a single session of real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) guided upregulation of prefrontal regions during an emotion regulation task enhances self-control during exposure to negative stimuli and facilitates transfer of the learned ER skills to daily life. In a cross-over design, individuals with a PTSD diagnosis after a single traumatic event (n = 20) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria and individuals without a formal psychiatric diagnosis (n = 21) underwent a cognitive reappraisal training. In randomized order, all participants completed two rtfMRI neurofeedback (NF) runs targeting the left lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and two control runs without NF (NoNF) while using cognitive reappraisal to reduce their emotional response to negative scenes. During the NoNF runs, two %%-signs were displayed instead of the two-digit feedback (FB) to achieve a comparable visual stimulation. The project aimed at defining the clinical potential of the training according to three success markers: (1) NF induced changes in left lateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala activity during the regulation of aversive scenes compared to cognitive reappraisal alone (primary registered outcome), (2) associated changes on the symptomatic and behavioral level such as indicated by PTSD symptom severity and affect ratings, (3) clinical utility such as indicated by perceived efficacy, acceptance, and transfer to daily life measured four weeks after the training. In comparison to the reappraisal without feedback, a neurofeedback-specific decrease in the left lateral PFC (d = 0.54) alongside an attenuation of amygdala responses (d = 0.33) emerged. Reduced amygdala responses during NF were associated with symptom improvement (r = -0.42) and less negative affect (r = -0.63) at follow-up. The difference in symptom scores exceeds requirements for a minimal clinically important difference and corresponds to a medium effect size (d = 0.64). Importantly, 75% of individuals with PTSD used the strategies in daily life during a one-month follow-up period and perceived the training as efficient. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of the NF training indicated by reduced amygdala responses that were associated with improved symptom severity and affective state four weeks after the NF training as well as patient-centered perceived control during the training, helpfulness and application of strategies in daily life. However, reduced prefrontal involvement was unexpected. The study suggests good tolerability of the training protocol and potential for clinical use in the treatment of PTSD.},

Here, we investigated the serotonergic modulation of intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) within the DMN in healthy adult females, controlling for the menstrual cycle phase. Eighteen healthy women in the follicular phase (aged 20-31 years) participated in a double-blind controlled cross-over study of serotonin depletion. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) and a balanced amino acid load (BAL), used as the control condition, were applied on two separate days of assessment. Neural resting state data using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and individual trait impulsivity scores were obtained. ATD compared with BAL significantly reduced FC with the DMN in the precuneus (associated with self-referential thinking) and enhanced FC with the DMN in the frontal cortex (associated with cognitive reasoning). Connectivity differences with the DMN between BAL and ATD in the precentral gyrus were significantly correlated with the magnitude of serotonin depletion. Right medial frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus connectivity differences with the DMN were inversely correlated with trait impulsivity. These findings partially deviate from previous findings obtained in males and underline the importance of gender-specific studies and controlling for menstrual cycle to further elucidate the mechanism of ATD-induced changes within intrinsic thought processes.},

Disturbances of these mechanisms on multiple levels of neural processing may contribute to clinical symptoms in major depression (MD). A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted to identify neurobiological foundations of altered mismatch processing in MD. Twenty-five patients with major depression and 25 matched healthy individuals completed an auditory mismatch paradigm optimized for fMRI. Brain activity during mismatch processing was compared between groups. Moreover, seed-based connectivity analyses investigated depression-specific brain networks. In patients, mismatch processing was associated with reduced activation in the right auditory cortex as well as in a fronto-parietal attention network. Moreover, functional coupling between the right auditory cortex and frontal areas was reduced in patients. Seed-to voxel analysis on the whole-brain level revealed reduced connectivity between the auditory cortex and the thalamus as well as posterior cingulate. The present study indicates deficits in sensory processing on the level of the auditory cortex in depression. Hyposensitivity in a fronto-parietal network presumably reflects altered attention mechanisms in depression. The observed impairments may contribute to psychopathology by reducing the ability of the affected individuals to orient attention toward important environmental cues.},

Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two independent coders performed the time-based analysis of the audio-visual game content. Boredom was operationalized as interaction of prolonged absence of goal-directed behavior with lowered affect in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). A decrease of positive affect (PA) correlated with response amplitudes in bilateral insular clusters extending into the amygdala to prolonged inactive phases in a game play and an increase in negative affect (NA) was associated with higher responses in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Precuneus and hippocampus responses were negatively correlated with changes in NA. We describe for the first time neural contributions to boredom, using a video game as complex virtual environment. Further our study confirmed that PA and NA are separable constructs, reflected by distinct neural patterns. PA may be associated with afferent limbic activity whereas NA with affective control.},

We examined the effect of this task-switching requirement on chest-compression quality to gain insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying performance in standard CPR. Understanding these mechanisms can help in the development of evidence-based practical implications and cognitive aids for CPR. A total of 300 first-year medical and dentistry students (212 females, 20.2 ± 4.4 years) participated in this randomized controlled trial. They received either a CPR training comprising both chest compressions and ventilation (standard CPR) or a CPR training comprising chest compressions only (chest-compression-only CPR). Chest-compression quality (compression depth and rate) was measured via a resuscitation manikin and analyzed using linear mixed models and linear trend analyses. Overall, chest-compression quality did not differ across standard CPR and chest-compression-only CPR. However, in standard CPR, compression quality was better after ventilation than before ventilation. Importantly, ventilation impaired the quality of the compressions executed immediately after ventilation, but the quality increased with each compression after ventilation, resulting in a better chest-compression quality after ventilation than before it. This study suggests that ventilation acts as a break, improving physical capability, which in turn enhances compressions after ventilation. However, at the same time, ventilation causes a task switch which increases cognitive demands and impairs chest-compression quality immediately after ventilation. Considering the negative effect of the task-switching demand on chest-compression quality, it is useful to develop cognitive aids for professional medical care. Such cognitive aids can signal an upcoming switch to ventilation, thereby reducing the multitasking load in terms of reduced monitoring demands with respect to the number of chest compressions that have already been executed.},

In particular, prefrontal regions have been postulated to control amygdala activity by inhibitory projections, and this process may be disrupted in aggressive individuals. The atypical antipsychotic quetiapine successfully attenuates aggressive behavior in various disorders; the underlying neural processes, however, are unknown. A strengthened functional coupling in the prefrontal-amygdala system may account for these anti-aggressive effects. An inhibition of this network has been reported for virtual aggression in violent video games as well. However, there have been so far no in-vivo observations of pharmacological influences on corticolimbic projections during human aggressive behavior. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, quetiapine and placebo were administered for three successive days prior to an fMRI experiment. In this experiment, functional brain connectivity was assessed during virtual aggressive behavior in a violent video game and an aggression-free control task in a non-violent modification. Quetiapine increased the functional connectivity of ACC and DLPFC with the amygdala during virtual aggression, whereas OFC-amygdala coupling was attenuated. These effects were observed neither for placebo nor for the non-violent control. These results demonstrate for the first time a pharmacological modification of aggression-related human brain networks in a naturalistic setting. The violence-specific modulation of prefrontal-amygdala networks appears to control aggressive behavior and provides a neurobiological model for the anti-aggressive effects of quetiapine.},

A validated inventory (state-trait operation anxiety-state) was used to assess perioperative state anxiety before (T1) and after (T2) surgery. In addition, trait operation anxiety was evaluated with an additional validated inventory (state-trait operation anxiety-trait). Moreover, user ratings on the usefulness of VORT were assessed with an evaluation questionnaire. Study arms were compared for perioperative state anxiety with two-tailed independent samples t tests. Subjective ratings were correlated with STOA-Trait values to investigate possible associations between perioperative anxiety with perceived usefulness. There were no significant differences in perioperative state anxiety between VORT and standard operation preparation procedures before and after the surgery. Nonetheless, patients' ratings of VORT overall were positive. The tour was perceived as useful and, therefore, showed acceptance for VR use. These ratings were unrelated to the degree of perioperative anxiety. The subjective benefit of VORT could not be explained by a reduction of perioperative anxiety. Instead, VORT appears to serve the need for information and reduce uncertainty. In addition, VORT is perceived as beneficial regardless of the age of the patients. Considering this effect and the manageable organizational and financial effort toward implementation, the general use of VORT can be recommended.

Three hours after challenge intake (ATD or a balanced control condition, BAL), resting state fMRI scans were obtained. In patients, ATD led to attenuated FC of the right superior premotor cortex (BA 6) with the DMN, comparable to the extent found in controls after BAL administration. ATD lowered FC of the left somatosensory cortex (BA 3) with the DMN, independently of the factor group, but with stronger effects in controls. Data reveal a serotonergic modulation of FC between BA 6 and 3, known to be relevant for motor planning and sensory perception, and the DMN, thereby possibly pointing toward ATD acting beneficially on neural planning of motor activity in patients with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Virtual environments (VEs), in the recent years, have become more prevalent in neuroscience. These VEs can offer great flexibility, replicability, and control over the presented stimuli in an immersive setting. With recent developments, it has become feasible to achieve higher-quality visuals and VEs at a reasonable investment. Our aim in this project was to develop and implement a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI)-based neurofeedback (NF) training paradigm, taking into account new technological advances that allow us to integrate complex stimuli into a visually updated and engaging VE. We built upon and developed a first-person shooter in which the dynamic change of the VE was the feedback variable in the brain-computer interface (BCI). We designed a study to assess the feasibility of the BCI in creating an immersive VE for NF training. In a randomized single-blinded fMRI-based NF-training session, 24 participants were randomly allocated into one of two groups: active and reduced contingency NF. All participants completed three runs of the shooter-game VE lasting 10 min each. Brain activity in a supplementary motor area region of interest regulated the possible movement speed of the player's avatar and thus increased the reward probability. The gaming performance revealed that the participants were able to actively engage in game tasks and improve across sessions. All 24 participants reported being able to successfully employ NF strategies during the training while performing in-game tasks with significantly higher perceived NF control ratings in the NF group. Spectral analysis showed significant differential effects on brain activity between the groups. Connectivity analysis revealed significant differences, showing a lowered connectivity in the NF group compared to the reduced contingency-NF group. The self-assessment manikin ratings showed an increase in arousal in both groups but failed significance. Arousal has been linked to presence, or feelings of immersion, supporting the VE's objective. Long paradigms, such as NF in MRI settings, can lead to mental fatigue; therefore, VEs can help overcome such limitations. The rewarding achievements from gaming targets can lead to implicit learning of self-regulation and may broaden the scope of NF applications.},

In such circumstances, video-assisted guidance by the dispatcher has been demonstrated to be advantageous for the recognition of cardiac arrest and the improvement of CPR quality. The present study investigates the effectiveness of a brief training program for control center dispatchers in the recognition of common errors during simulated resuscitation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and registered at the German Clinical Trial Register on 27th of February 2024 (Registration number: DRKS00032661) prior to inclusion of the first participant. Within a two-armed group study design, paramedics and emergency physicians were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 44) or a control group (n = 44). The experimental group was initially exposed to a targeted brief training aimed at enhancing the recognition of excessively deep chest compression depth. All participants evaluated 42 distinct video sequences showing seven typical errors during CPR. The shown CPRs were simulated on a training manikin and the videos were evaluated by the participants under laboratory conditions. The primary endpoint was the accurate evaluation of the presented videos with too deep compression depth in a laboratory setting. A total of 3696 video sequences were evaluated. The experimental group demonstrated a significantly higher recognition rate for too deep chest compressions compared to the control group (87.9% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001). With regard to the remaining errors, no significant differences were observed between the study groups. Overall, 2861 of the 3696 videos (77.7%) were correctly classified. The proportion of correctly classified videos was significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group (79.8% vs. 75.6%, p = 0.003), indicating a statistically significant effect of the intervention. The identification of chest compressions with too deep compression depth in a video of simulated CPR was found to increase significantly in evaluators who had undergone a brief training course. The trial was registered in the German Clinical Trial Register "BfArM - Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien (DRKS)" under the registration number DRKS00032661.},

Possible explanations may be obsolescence and/or a shift in needs. We investigated whether overarching topics and specific learning objectives of the WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide are still up-to-date, their attributed importance, and their perceived difficulty to achieve. Experts on patient safety and medical education from 3 European countries were asked to suggest learning objectives concerning patient safety using group concept mapping. Following 3 successive steps, experts rated ideas by importance and difficulty to achieve. Correlation analyses investigated the relationship between those. Overarching topics of the learning goals (clusters) were identified with multivariate analysis. A total of 119 statements about intended learning objectives on patient safety were generated, of which 86 remained for sorting and rating. Based on multivariate analyses, 10 overarching topics (clusters) emerged. Both the learning objectives and the overarching topics showed high correspondence with the WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide. Strong correlations emerged between importance and difficulty ratings for learning objectives and overarching topics. The WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide's learning goals are still relevant and up-to-date. Remarkably, learning objectives categorized as highly important are also perceived as difficult to achieve. In summary, the insufficient implementation in medical curricula cannot be attributed to the content of the learning goals. The future focus should be on how the WHO learning goals can be implemented in existing curricular courses.},

However, the question whether perceptual integration of facial and vocal emotions takes place in primary sensory areas, multimodal cortices, or in affective structures remains unanswered yet. Using novel computer-generated stimuli, we combined emotional faces and voices in congruent and incongruent ways and assessed functional brain data (fMRI) during an emotional classification task. Both congruent and incongruent audiovisual stimuli evoked larger responses in thalamus and superior temporal regions compared with unimodal conditions. Congruent emotions were characterized by activation in amygdala, insula, ventral posterior cingulate (vPCC), temporo-occipital, and auditory cortices; incongruent emotions activated a frontoparietal network and bilateral caudate nucleus, indicating a greater processing load in working memory and emotion-encoding areas. The vPCC alone exhibited differential reactions to congruency and incongruency for all emotion categories and can thus be considered a central structure for supramodal representation of complex emotional information. Moreover, the left amygdala reflected supramodal representation of happy stimuli. These findings document that emotional information does not merge at the perceptual audiovisual integration level in unimodal or multimodal areas, but in vPCC and amygdala.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was measured in fifteen right-handed males while playing the video game Carmageddon. Neuroimaging data were analyzed based on violent and non-violent success and failure events. Correlations with subjective game experience measured brain-behavior and -affect relationships. Results revealed a differential involvement of the striatal reward system: non-violent success elicited activation of the ventral striatum, whereas violent success activated specifically the dorsal striatum. Subjective game experience correlated with putamen and medial prefrontal cortex activation specifically for violent success. These results emphasize a differential neural processing of violent and non-violent success events in dorsal and ventral striatum. Virtual violence seems to enable selective responses of the reward system and positive in-game experience.},

Typical problems arising from either low or exaggerated interspecific morphological differentiation are best met by automated methods of machine learning that learn efficient and effective species identification from training samples. However, limited infraspecific sampling remains a key challenge also in machine learning. In this study, we assessed whether a data augmentation approach may help to overcome the problem of scarce training data in automated visual species identification. The stepwise augmentation of data comprised image rotation as well as visual and virtual augmentation. The visual data augmentation applies classic approaches of data augmentation and generation of artificial images using a generative adversarial networks approach. Descriptive feature vectors are derived from bottleneck features of a VGG-16 convolutional neural network that are then stepwise reduced in dimensionality using Global Average Pooling and principal component analysis to prevent overfitting. Finally, data augmentation employs synthetic additional sampling in feature space by an oversampling algorithm in vector space. Applied on four different image data sets, which include scarab beetle genitalia (Pleophylla, Schizonycha) as well as wing patterns of bees (Osmia) and cattleheart butterflies (Parides), our augmentation approach outperformed a deep learning baseline approach by means of resulting identification accuracy with nonaugmented data as well as a traditional 2D morphometric approach (Procrustes analysis of scarab beetle genitalia).

Important top-down influences are attentional focus and supramodal social memory representations. The present study investigated the neural networks underlying these top-down processes and their role in social stimulus classification. In a neuroimaging study with 45 healthy participants, we employed a social adaptation of the Implicit Association Test. Attentional focus was modified via the classification task, which compared two domains of social perception (emotion and gender), using the exactly same stimulus set. Supramodal memory representations were addressed via congruency of the target categories for the classification of auditory and visual social stimuli (voices and faces). Functional magnetic resonance imaging identified attention-specific and supramodal networks. Emotion classification networks included bilateral anterior insula, pre-supplementary motor area, and right inferior frontal gyrus. They were pure attention-driven and independent from stimulus modality or congruency of the target concepts. No neural contribution of supramodal memory representations could be revealed for emotion classification. In contrast, gender classification relied on supramodal memory representations in rostral anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. In summary, different domains of social perception involve different top-down processes which take place in clearly distinguishable neural networks.},

Unique challenges faced by healthcare facilities in border regions render them particularly vulnerable during crises, emphasizing the need to promote resilience in these areas. The current study evaluated the state and needs of resilience in healthcare professionals in a representative European border region. All hospitals and emergency medical care services in the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands) were approached to participate via an online-survey. Behavioral data on psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), work-related stressors, individual resilience (Brief Resilience Scale, Resilience at Work scale), and organizational resilience (Benchmark Resilience Tool-short) were collected. 2233 participants initiated the survey with 500 responses included in the analysis. 46% of the participants indicated clinically significant psychological distress. Most challenging stressors were staff availability, available time, and workload. On average, individual resilience was in the normal range, yet 15.6% showed below average resilience. At the organizational level, healthcare institutions can particularly enhance resilience in the domains of Internal resources, Situation Awareness, and Unity of purpose. Compared to their neighbor countries, German healthcare professionals indicated higher levels of depressive symptoms, were more burdened by work-related stressors, and reported lower levels of organizational resilience. Findings highlight that healthcare institutions not only need to promote the resilience of the individual employee particularly in border regions, healthcare institutions, must also act to be better prepared for potential threats and crises while considering each country's unique needs.},

The limited availability of highly qualified instructors and tight economic conditions complicates the delivery of these life-saving trainings. Consequently, innovative and resource-efficient approaches are needed to minimize or eliminate contagion while maintaining high training standards and managing learner anxiety related to infection risk. In a non-inferiority trial 346 first-year medical, dentistry, and physiotherapy students underwent BLS training at AIXTRA-Competence Center for Training and Patient Safety at the University Hospital RWTH Aachen. Our objectives were (1) to examine whether peer feedback BLS training supported by tele-instructors matches the learning performance of standard instructor-guided BLS training for laypersons; and (2) to minimize infection risk during BLS training. Therefore, in a parallel group design, we compared arm (1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) BLS training (Historical control group of 2019) with arm (2) a Tele-Instructor Supported Peer-Feedback (TPF) BLS training (Intervention group of 2020). Both study arms were based on Peyton's 4-step approach. Before and after each training session, objective data for BLS performance (compression depth and rate) were recorded using a resuscitation manikin. We also assessed overall BLS performance via standardized instructor evaluation and student self-reports of confidence via questionnaire. Non-inferiority margins for the outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with SIF. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority. The results confirmed non-inferiority of TPF to SIF for all tested outcome parameters. A follow-up after 2 weeks found no confirmed COVID-19 infections among the participants. Tele-instructor supported peer feedback is a powerful alternative to in-person instructor feedback on BLS skills during a pandemic, where infection risk needs to be minimized while maximizing the quality of BLS skill learning. https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00025199, Trial ID: DRKS00025199.},

Neurofeedback (NF) seems a promising method to address the neural dysfunctions underlying those cognitive impairments. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a central hub for cognitive processing, is one of the brain regions known to be dysfunctional in schizophrenia. Here we conducted NF training based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with schizophrenia to enable them to control their ACC activity. Training was performed over 3 days in a group of 11 patients with schizophrenia and 11 healthy controls. Social feedback was provided in accordance with the evoked activity in the selected region of interest (ROI). Neural and cognitive strategies were examined off-line. Both groups learned to control the activity of their ACC but used different neural strategies: patients activated the dorsal and healthy controls the rostral subdivision. Patients mainly used imagination of music to elicit activity and the control group imagination of sports. In a stepwise regression analysis, the difference in neural control did not result from the differences in cognitive strategies but from diagnosis alone. Based on social reinforcers, patients with schizophrenia can learn to regulate localized brain activity. However, cognitive strategies and neural network location differ from healthy controls. These data emphasize that for therapeutic interventions in patients with schizophrenia compensatory strategies may emerge. Specific cognitive skills or specific dysfunctional networks should be addressed to train impaired skills. Social NF based on fMRI may be one method to accomplish precise learning targets.},

  abstract = {Practical skills training is an essential part of medical education. An important example is the training of Basic Life Support (BLS) skills, which are key to improve patient outcomes in life-threatening situations. However, despite practical training, BLS performance is often sub-optimal even among healthcare professionals and medical students. Finding more effective training methods is therefore of high importance. A promising method to enhance learning outcomes is reflective practice. The goal of the present study was to evaluate whether a short reflective practice intervention following standard BLS training (Peyton's 4-step approach) improves BLS training outcomes, reflected in higher BLS performance and higher self-confidence to perform BLS. 287 first-year medical students were randomly assigned to one of two BLS training conditions: 1) standard BLS training (ST), 2) ST followed by a 15-minute reflective practice exercise. Outcome parameters included objective BLS performance data assessed by a resuscitation manikin, and students' self-reported confidence in their BLS skills. Outcomes were assessed directly after the training (T0) and re-assessed one week later (T1). A two-way mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effect of the intervention on BLS performance and self-reported confidence. Significance was determined by two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The intervention group performed significantly more effective compressions at T1 and began significantly faster with performing their first chest compression at T0 and T1, in comparison to the control group. No significant differences between study groups regarding their self-reported confidence to perform BLS were observed. This research shows that standard BLS training accompanied with a simple, cost-effective reflective practice exercise can improve learners' BLS skill acquisition and retention. This shows that reflective practice has the potential to enhance practical skills training in medicine; yet, more empirical studies are needed to examine its broader applicability.},

The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize the consultation requests of the ICU to the PC consultation team as well as the patients by a description of trajectories and interventions. Retrospective analysis of all patients receiving intensive care at RWTH Aachen University Hospital in 2019 for whom a PC consultation was requested. The patient population transferred from the ICU to the PC ward was compared with the non-transferred population. In each case, the primary consultation was evaluated regarding the following factors: question, vigilance, length of time from consultation request to its performance, and primary focus of the question. The question focus was categorized into "symptom control", "counselling" and "transfer" (tick options). In addition, a free text field was available for further notes. Exploration of diagnoses was complemented by accessing the electronic health records. A total of 102 consultation requests from the ICU to the PC ward were evaluated. The morbidity of patients was high, and most patients had at least one of the following diagnoses: pulmonary (62%), cardiovascular (61%), and/or neurological disease (55%). Of the patients 32 (31%) were transferred to the PC ward, among whom weakness (94%), fatigue (77%), anxiety (55%), pain (53%), and dyspnea (48%) were the most frequently noted symptoms.

In total, 35 (34%) of all patients who were seen by palliative care specialists on ICUs in 2019 could be discharged alive. The most frequent reasons for nonadmission were lack of capacity of the PC ward (33%), dying while being on the waiting list (20%), and refusal by the patient (20%). Of the patients, 7 (26%) died within 48 h after they had been transferred to the PC ward.

  abstract = {Training Basic Life Support saves lives. However, current BLS training approaches are time-consuming and costly. Alternative cost-efficient and effective training methods are highly needed. The present study evaluated whether a video-feedback supported peer-guided Basic Life Support training approach achieves similar practical performance as a standard instructor-guided training in laypersons. In a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial, 288 first-year medical students were randomized to two study arms with different Basic Life Support training methods: 1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) or 2) a Peer Video Feedback (PVF). Outcome parameters were objective data for Basic Life Support performance (compression depth and rate) from a resuscitation manikin with recording software as well as overall Basic Life Support performance and subjective confidence. Non-inferiority margins (Δ) for these outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with Standard Instructor Feedback. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority. Results confirmed non-inferiority of Peer Video Feedback to Standard Instructor Feedback for compression depth (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 2.9%; 95% CI: -8.2% to 14.1%; Δ = -19%), overall Basic Life Support performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 6.7%; 95% CI: 0.0% to 14.3%; Δ = -27%) and subjective confidence for CPR performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.01; 95% CI: -0.18-0.17; Δ = -0.5) and emergency situations (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.02; 95% CI: -0.21-0.18; Δ = -0.5). Results for compression rate were inconclusive. Peer Video Feedback achieves comparable results as standard instructor-based training methods. It is an easy-to-apply and cost-efficient alternative to standard Basic Life Support training methods. To improve performance with respect to compression rate, additional implementation of a metronome is recommended.},

  abstract = {Diminished synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) has been linked to disrupted impulse control in aversive contexts. However, the neural correlates underlying a serotonergic modulation of female impulsivity remain unclear. The present study investigated punishment-induced inhibition in healthy young women. Eighteen healthy female subjects (aged 20-31) participated in a double-blinded, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, within subjects, repeated measures study. They were assessed on two randomly assigned occasions that were controlled for menstrual cycle phase. In a randomized order, one day, acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) was used to reduce 5-HT synthesis in the brain. On the other day, participants received a tryptophan-balanced amino acid load (BAL) as a control condition. Three hours after administration of ATD/BAL, neural activity was recorded during a modified Go/No-Go task implementing reward or punishment processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neural activation during No-Go trials in punishment conditions after BAL versus ATD administration correlated positively with the magnitude of central 5-HT depletion in the ventral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). Furthermore, neural activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and the dorsal ACC correlated positively with trait impulsivity. The results indicate reduced neural sensitivity to punishment after short-term depletion of 5-HT in brain areas related to emotion regulation (subgenual ACC) increasing with depletion magnitude and in brain areas related to appraisal and expression of emotions (mOFC and dorsal ACC), increasing with trait impulsivity. This suggests a serotonergic modulation of neural circuits related to emotion regulation, impulsive behavior, and punishment processing in females.},

To present the results of the long-term follow-up of a cohort of patients with JEB-H, and to provide guidelines for prognosis, treatment and care. All patients with JEB-H included in the Dutch Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) Registry between 1988 and 2011 were followed longitudinally by our EB team. Diagnosis was established using immunofluorescence antigen mapping, electron microscopy and DNA analysis. In total, we included 22 patients with JEB-H over a 23-year period. Their average age at death was 5.8 months (range 0.5-32.6 months). The causes of death were, in order of frequency: failure to thrive, respiratory failure, pneumonia, dehydration, anaemia, sepsis and euthanasia. The pattern of initial weight gain was a predictor of lifespan in these patients. Invasive treatments to extend life did not promote survival in our patients. It is important to diagnose JEB-H as soon as possible after birth so that the management can be shifted from life-saving to comfort care. The palliative end-of-life care can take place in hospital, but is also safe in the home setting. Suffering in patients with JEB-H can become so unbearable that in some patients who do not respond to adequate analgesic and sedative treatment, newborn euthanasia, performed according to the Groningen protocol, is legally permitted in the Netherlands.},

Each patient received an initial dose (ID) of either vecuronium (V) or ORG 9487 (O) followed by maintenance doses (MDn) of either V or O (ID/MD: O/O, V/O, O/V, and V/V). The time course of action was measured mechanomyographically, determining the duration until 25% recovery of the single twitch (DUR25). The onset time of an ID of ORG 9487 was shorter than that of an ID of vecuronium (96 vs 203 sec, P < 0.001). The DUR25 of the ID of ORG 9487 was less than half that of vecuronium (10.7 +/- 2.8 vs 28.8 +/- 6.1 min, P < 0.001). The DUR25 of MD1 and MD2 of ORG 9487 were shorter than those of vecuronium (O/O: 7.3 +/- 2.8 and 8.5 +/- 2.4 min; V/O: 12.7 +/- 3.3 and 11.5 +/- 3.5 min, vs O/V: 16.4 +/- 4.5 and 20.6 +/- 4.7 min; V/V: 18.8 +/- 3.0 and 20.1 +/- 3.8 min, respectively, P < 0.05). AN ID of vecuronium prolonged the DUR25 of MD1 and MD2 of ORG 9487 (P < 0.05). ORG 9487 is a muscle relaxant with a shorter duration of action than vecuronium.

Retrospective cohort study. The study was performed at the University Medical Centre Groningen in the 4 years between 1 January 2010 and the 31 December 2013. Complications and their severity were graded according to the standard complication score (20 items) of the Dutch Society of Anaesthesia. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for the reported complications. A total of 81 267 anaesthetic cases were included. In the paediatric cohort, there were 410 (2.9%) complications and 1675 (2.5%) in the adults. In both cohorts age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists classification and emergency treatment were independent risk factors for complications. With respect to age, infants less than 1 year were at the highest risk, whereas in the adult cohort, increased age was related to a greater number of complications. The incidences of the specific complications were different between both cohorts. Upper airway obstruction was more frequently observed in paediatric patients (26%), whereas in the adults, complications with the highest incidence concerned conversion of regional-to-general anaesthesia (25%) and hypotension (17%). Risk factors for all peri-operative complications were similar for paediatric and adult anaesthesia. However, the incidence of specific complications differed between both age categories.},

After 3 days, the epidural analgesia was stopped and the patient regained her preoperative motor function within 5 h.

Nevertheless, it is frequently prescribed to pediatric patients as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia or for procedural sedation. There is ample literature on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in this vulnerable patient population, but there is a general lack of consensus on dosing. In this project, we aimed to use the standardized workflow of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary to establish best evidence-based pediatric dosing guidelines for dexmedetomidine as premedication and for procedural sedation. The available literature on dexmedetomidine in pediatrics was reviewed in order to address the following three questions: (1) What is the right dose? (2) What is known about efficacy? (3) What is known about safety? Relevant literature was compiled into a risk-benefit analysis document. A team of clinical experts critically appraised the analysis and the proposed dosing recommendations. Dexmedetomidine is most commonly administered via the intravenous or intranasal route. Clearance is age dependent, warranting higher doses in infants to reach similar exposure as in adults. Dexmedetomidine use results in satisfactory sedation at parent separation, adequate sedation and a favorable recovery profile. The safety profile is good and comparable to adults, with dose-related hemodynamic effects. Following the structured approach of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary, best evidence-based dosing recommendations were proposed for dexmedetomidine, used as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia (intranasal dose) and for procedural sedation (intranasal and intravenous dose) in pediatric patients.},

CHDs were distributed equally in patients with mild or severe CARMs. Patients with multiple congenital abnormalities were more frequently diagnosed with CHD (n = 16, 36%) than patients without multiple congenital malformations (n = 5, 9%, P = .001). Patients with CARM diagnosed with CHD using pediatric cardiac echo screening were younger than 3 months of age at diagnosis. Earlier general pediatric examinations missed 7 (50%) children with mild and 4 (50%) with severe CHDs. The severity of CARM could predict neither prevalence nor severity of CHD. More than one-half of CHDs were missed during the first physical examination. No new CHDs were found in patients older than 3 months of age at the time CARMs were diagnosed. We recommend screening all patients with CARM younger than 3 months of age for CHD at the time CARM is diagnosed.

A mixed methods approach was used, consisting of information retrieved from medical records on prescribed pain medication from Ghana and Benin, and semi-structured interviews with health care personnel (HCP) from Ghana on pain perceptions, assessment and treatment. Medical records (n = 149) of patients treated between 2008 and 2012 were collected between November 2012 and August 2013. Interviews (n = 11) were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and qualitatively analyzed. In 113 (84%) of the 135 included records, pain medication, mostly simple analgesics, was prescribed. In 48% of the prescriptions, an indication was not documented. HCP reported that advanced BU could be painful, especially after wound care and after a skin graft. They reported not be trained in the assessment of mild pain. Pain recognition was perceived as difficult, as patients were said to suppress or to exaggerate pain, and to have different expectations regarding acceptable pain levels. HCP reported a fear of side effects of pain medication, shortage and irregularities in the supply of pain medication, and time constraints among medical doctors for pain management. Professionals perceived BU disease as potentially painful, and predominantly focused on severe pain. Our study suggests that pain in BU deserves attention and should be integrated in current treatment.},

From this perspective, prehabilitation-a proactive, multimodal approach to enhance patients' functional, nutritional, and psychological status prior to surgery-has gained attention as a potential contributor to value-based, personalized care. This study aims to synthesize mechanistic rationale, clinical evidence, and system-level considerations for prehabilitation, with particular focus on allostatic capacity and the body's response to surgical stress. Current evidence shows that prehabilitation may reduce postoperative complications, shorten hospital stays, and improve functional recovery, particularly when interventions are multimodal. However, the existing literature is characterized by methodological heterogeneity and variable quality, seemingly limiting generalizability and large-scale implementation. Further research is required to standardize outcome measures, identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit, and evaluate cost-effectiveness. Integration of prehabilitation into perioperative care pathways will depend on improved mechanistic understanding, robust clinical trials, and alignment with broader health policy and system-level initiatives. Prehabilitation may represent a meaningful step toward value-based and sustainable surgical care, though its implementation must be guided by high-quality evidence and careful consideration of context-specific factors.},

Furthermore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of ARA290. Twenty-six male Lewis/HanHsd rats were exposed to unilateral ischemia for 30 minutes, with subsequent removal of the contralateral kidney. Post-reperfusion, ARA290 was administered early (one hour), late (four hours) or repetitive (one and four hours). Saline was used as vehicle treatment. Rats were sacrificed after three days. Early ARA290 treatment improved renal function. Late- or repetitive treatment tended to improve clinical markers. Furthermore, early ARA290 treatment reduced renal inflammation and acute kidney injury at three days post-reperfusion. Late- or repetitive treatment did not affect inflammation or acute kidney injury. ARA290 attenuated renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study showed the anti-inflammatory effect of ARA290 and suggests early administration in the post-reperfusional phase is most effective.

This randomised, double-blinded trial evaluated the effect of RIC on kidney graft outcome in the first year, and examined the predictive value of a new measure of initial kidney graft function, i.e. the estimated time to a 50% reduction in plasma creatinine post-transplantation (tCr50). A total of 225 patients undergoing deceased donor kidney transplantation were randomised to RIC or a sham procedure performed prior to kidney reperfusion. Up to four repetitive cycles of five minutes of leg ischaemia and five minutes of reperfusion were given. GFR, plasma creatinine, cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured at three and twelve months and estimated GFR was calculated using four different equations. Other secondary outcomes were identified from patient files. RIC did not affect GFR or other outcomes when compared to the sham procedure at three or twelve months. tCr50 correlated with one year graft function (p<0.0001 for both mGFR and eGFR estimates). In contrast, DGF i.e. "need of dialysis the first week" did not correlate significantly with one year GFR. RIC during deceased donor kidney transplantation did not improve one year outcome.

This study aimed to establish a stable and reproducible porcine kidney NMP model incorporating sevoflurane delivery. Different administration techniques and oxygenator setups were evaluated to identify the most effective method of sevoflurane application. Administering sevoflurane directly as a liquid into the perfusate resulted in excessive gas formation and unstable drug concentrations. In contrast, using a vaporizer connected to an Inspire 8F M oxygenator allowed for stable and reproducible sevoflurane levels over a 90-min perfusion period, while maintaining sufficient oxygenation. This method proved to be a reliable approach for sevoflurane delivery in kidney NMP. However, oxygenators exposed to sevoflurane should not be reused due to the risk of membrane damage. These findings support the feasibility of using sevoflurane in kidney NMP and provide a platform for further investigation into its potential to improve renal graft outcomes.},

  abstract = {Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are among the most commonly administered drugs in the perioperative period due to their prominent role in pain management. However, they potentially have perioperative consequences due to immune-modulating effects through the inhibition of prostanoid synthesis, thereby affecting the levels of various cytokines. These effects may have a direct impact on the postoperative outcome of patients since the immune system aims to restore homeostasis and plays an indispensable role in regeneration and repair. By affecting the immune response, consequences can be expected on various organ systems. This narrative review aims to highlight these potential immune system-related consequences, which include systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, immediate and persistent postoperative pain, effects on oncological and neurologic outcome, and wound, anastomotic, and bone healing.},

Experimental evidence indicates that remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) provides systemic protection against ischaemia-reperfusion injury in various tissues. 'Remote ischaemic conditioning in renal transplantation--effect on immediate and extended kidney graft function' (the CONTEXT study) is an investigator initiated, multicentre, randomised controlled trial investigating whether RIC of the leg of the recipient improves short and long-term graft function following deceased donor kidney transplantation. The study will include 200 kidney transplant recipients of organ donation after brain death and 20 kidney transplant recipients of organ donation after circulatory death. Participants are randomised in a 1:1 design to RIC or sham-RIC (control). RIC consists of four cycles of 5 min occlusion of the thigh by a tourniquet inflated to 250 mm Hg, separated by 5 min of deflation. Primary end point is the time to a 50% reduction from the baseline plasma creatinine, estimated from the changes of plasma creatinine values 30 days post-transplant or 30 days after the last performed dialysis post-transplant. Secondary end points are: need of dialysis post-transplant, measured and estimated-glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 3 and 12 months after transplantation, patient and renal graft survival, number of rejection episodes in the first year, and changes in biomarkers of acute kidney injury and inflammation in plasma, urine and graft tissue. The study is approved by the local ethical committees and national data security agencies. Results are expected to be published in 2016. NCT01395719.},

To study its dynamics in kidney transplant recipients (KTR), we determined whether the degree of frailty and its domains are affected by kidney transplantation (KT). Between 2015 and 2017, 176 KTR were included. Frailty scores were measured using the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), assessed preoperatively and during follow-up. Transitions in frailty state and changes in the individual domains were determined. Mean age (±SD) was 51.8 (± 14.1) years, and 63.1% of KTR were male. Thirty patients were considered frail (GFI ≥ 4) at baseline. After a mean follow-up of 22.8 ± 8.3 months, 34 non-frail patients (19.3%) became frail, 125 patients (71.0%) remained the same, and 17 frail patients (9.7%) became non-frail (GFI < 4). In the domain psychosocial functioning, 28.4% of the patients had an increase in GFI score after follow-up. Patients who scored a point in the domain cognition at baseline had a greater chance of becoming frail (OR 4.38, 95% CI 0.59-32.24). In conclusion, almost one-fifth of non-frail KTR transitioned to a frail state after their transplantation. These results could be used to predict the impact of KT on frailty course and help with implementing prehabilitation for patients at risk.},

One of these processes is associated with the phenomenon of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Anaesthetic conditioning is a widely described strategy to attenuate ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We therefore conducted the Volatile Anaesthetic Protection of Renal Transplants-1 trial, a pilot project evaluating the influence of two anaesthetic regimens, propofol- vs sevoflurane-based anaesthesia, on biochemical and clinical outcomes in living donor kidney transplantation. Sixty couples were randomly assigned to the following three groups: PROP (donor and recipient propofol), SEVO (donor and recipient sevoflurane), and PROSE (donor propofol and recipient sevoflurane). The primary outcome was renal injury reflected by urinary biomarkers. The follow-up period was 2 yr. Three couples were excluded, leaving 57 couples for analysis. Concentrations of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), N -acetyl-β- d -glucosaminidase (NAG), and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) in the first urine upon reperfusion showed no differences. On day 2, KIM-1 concentrations were higher in SEVO [952.8 (interquartile range 311.8-1893.0) pg mmol -1 ] compared with PROP [301.2 (202.0-504.7) pg mmol -1 ]. This was the same for NAG: SEVO, 1.835 (1.162-2.457) IU mmol -1 vs PROP, 1.078 (0.819-1.713) IU mmol -1 . Concentrations of H-FABP showed no differences. Measured glomerular filtration rate at 3, 6, and 12 months showed no difference. After 2 yr, there was a difference in the acute rejection rate ( P =0.039). Post hoc testing revealed a difference between PROP (35%) and PROSE (5%; P =0.020). The difference between PROP and SEVO (11%) was not significant ( P =0.110). The SEVO group showed higher urinary KIM-1 and NAG concentrations in living donor kidney transplantation on the second day after transplantation. This was not reflected in inferior graft outcome.

In our centre, patients transplanted preemptively are considered at increased risk of renal graft thrombosis compared to patients who are dialysis-dependent at time of transplantation. Therefore these patients are given a single dose of 5000 IU unfractionated heparin intraoperatively before clamping of the vessels. We questioned whether there is a difference in haemostatic state between preemptively and non-preemptively transplanted patients and whether the distinction in intraoperative heparin administration used in our center is justified. For this analysis, citrate samples of patients participating in the VAPOR-1 trial were used and several haemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters were measured in 29 preemptively and 28 non-preemptively transplanted patients and compared to 37 living kidney donors. Sample points were: induction anaesthesia (T1), 5 minutes after reperfusion (T2) and 2 hours postoperative (T3). At T1, recipient groups showed comparable elevated levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4, indicating platelet activation), prothrombin fragment F1+2 and D-dimer (indicating coagulation activation) and Von Willebrand Factor (indicating endothelial activation) compared to the donors. The Clot Lysis Time (CLT, a measure of fibrinolytic potential) was prolonged in both recipient groups compared to the donors. At T3, F1+2, PF4 and CLT were higher in non-preemptively transplanted recipients compared to preemptively transplanted recipients. Compared to donors, non-preemptive recipients showed a prolonged CLT, but comparable levels of PF4 and D-dimer. In conclusion pre-transplantation, preemptively and non-preemptively transplanted patients show a comparable enhanced haemostatic state. A distinction in intraoperative heparin administration between preemptive and non-preemptive transplantation does not seem justified.},

Reperfusion takes place in the recipient and most of the injury following ischemia and reperfusion occurs during this reperfusion phase; therefore, the intra-operative period seems an attractive window of opportunity to modulate IRI and improve short- and potentially long-term graft outcome. Commonly used volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane and isoflurane have been shown to interfere with many of the pathophysiological processes involved in the injurious cascade of IRI. Therefore, volatile anesthetic (VA) agents might be the preferred anesthetics used during the transplantation procedure.

Consequently, kidney transplant recipients paradoxically are at risk for both thrombosis and bleeding.

Systemic venous, systemic arterial, and renal venous samples were taken at multiple timepoints during and after LDKT. Levels of mtDNA genes changed over time and between vascular compartments. Several donor, recipient, and transplantation-related variables significantly explained the course of mtDNA genes over time. mtDNA genes predicted 1-month and 24-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and acute rejection episodes in the two-year follow-up period. To conclude, mtDNA is released in plasma during the process of LDKT, either from the kidney or from the whole body in response to transplantation.

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the quality of evidence of the included studies, determine the prevalence of frailty among kidney transplant candidates, and evaluate the relationship between frailty and associated patient characteristics and outcomes after kidney transplantation. A systematic search was performed for relevant literature on frailty and kidney transplantation. This was followed by a meta-analysis for patient characteristics and outcomes reported by a minimum of 2 studies including mean age, gender, mean body mass index, type of kidney transplantation, dialysis, previous kidney transplantation, comorbidities, hypertension, race, preemptive kidney transplantation, delayed graft function, and length of stay. A total of 18 studies were included in the systematic review and 14 of those studies were suitable for meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of frailty before transplantation was estimated at 17.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.4-18.7). Frailty was significantly associated with higher age (mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-5.9), lower rate of preemptive transplantation (relative risk, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9), longer duration of delayed graft function (relative risk, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0), and length of stay longer than 2 wk (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3). One in 6 kidney transplant recipients is frail before transplantation. The presence of frailty is associated with lower rates of preemptive transplantation, older recipient age, higher rates of delayed graft function, and longer length of stay. Future research is required to explore the association of frailty with other adverse outcomes after kidney transplantation and the effects of intervention programs to improve the different frailty domains.},

Intraoperative heparin and antiplatelet therapy were not associated with increased bleeding risk. These regimens appear to be safe for the possible prevention of TEC without increasing the risk for bleeding after KTx.},

We studied the ability of four biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), cystatin C, and YKL-40) to predict DGF after deceased donor transplantation, and their association with early graft function and GFR at three and twelve months. 225 deceased donor kidney transplant recipients were included. Biomarkers were measured using automated assays or ELISA. We calculated their ability to predict the need for dialysis post-transplant and correlated with the estimated time to a 50% reduction in plasma creatinine (tCr50), measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and estimated GFR (eGFR). All biomarkers measured at Day 1, except urinary L-FABP, significantly correlated with tCr50 and mGFR at Day 5. Plasma NGAL at Day 1 and a timed urine output predicted DGF (AUC = 0.91 and AUC 0.98).

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing any of the known PEDs with placebo during intensive-care unit (ICU) admission was performed, excluding erythropoietin stimulating agents. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, while outcomes from non-eligible studies for meta-analysis were reported separately. Risk of bias was assessed through the cochrane risk of bias (ROB) 2 tool. Twenty-three studies were included. Only studies using growth hormone, nandrolone, and oxandrolone were found. Growth hormone improved nitrogen balance (standardized mean difference = 1.4 g, 95% confidence interval 0.47-2.32). While mortality was unaffected, it caused increased ICU and hospital stay. A substantial heterogeneity and a concerning risk of bias were present among the studies. PEDs showed no survival benefit but may improve nitrogen balance. A possible subgroup that could benefit from growth hormone or anabolic steroids are critically ill patients who have surpassed the acute inflammatory phase of critical illness. Further research into various aspects of PEDs is needed within the context of current clinical practices.},

Systemic venous, arterial, renal venous, and urinary samples were collected in donors and recipients before, during, and after transplantation. R-SH was measured colorimetrically. Systemic arterial R-SH levels in recipients increased significantly up to 30 sec after reperfusion (p < 0.001). In contrast, renal venous R-SH levels significantly decreased at 5 and 10 min compared to 30 sec after reperfusion (both p < 0.001). This resulted in a significant decrease in delta R-SH (defined as the difference between renal venous and systemic arterial R-SH levels) till 30 sec after reperfusion (p < 0.001), indicating a net decrease in R-SH levels across the transplanted kidney. Overall, these results suggest trans-renal oxidative stress as a consequence of IRI during kidney transplantation, reflected by systemic and renal changes in R-SH levels in transplant recipients.},

Eight female Dutch Landrace pigs were exposed to unilateral renal ischemia for 45 minutes with simultaneous cannulation of the ureter of the ischemic kidney. ARA290 or saline was administered by an intravenous injection at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-reperfusion. The animals were sacrificed seven days post-reperfusion. ARA290 increased glomerular filtration rate during the observation period of seven days. Furthermore, ARA290 tended to reduce MCP-1 and IL-6 expression 15 minutes post-reperfusion. Seven days post-reperfusion ARA290 reduced interstitial fibrosis. The improvement in renal function following renal ischemia/reperfusion and reduced structural damage observed in this study by ARA290 warrants further investigation towards clinical application.},

Although several studies have investigated risk factors for the development of cognitive impairment in the early postoperative phase, risk factors for pNCD at 3 months have been less well studied. The aim of this study was to identify potential anaesthesia-related risk factors for pNCD at 3 months after surgery. We analysed data obtained for a prospective observational study in patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent surgery for excision of a solid tumour. Cognitive function was assessed preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively using 5 neuropsychological tests. Postoperative NCD was defined as a postoperative decline of ≥ 25% relative to baseline in ≥ 2 tests. The association between anaesthesia-related factors (type of anaesthesia, duration of anaesthesia, agents used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia and analgesia, the use of additional vasoactive medication, depth of anaesthesia [bispectral index] and mean arterial pressure) and pNCD was analysed using logistic regression analyses. Furthermore, the relation between anaesthesia-related factors and change in cognitive test scores expressed as a continuous variable was analysed using a z-score. Of the 196 included patients, 23 (12%) fulfilled the criteria for pNCD at 3 months postoperatively. A low preoperative score on Mini-Mental State Examination (OR, 8.9 [95% CI, (2.8-27.9)], p < 0.001) and a longer duration of anaesthesia (OR, 1.003 [95% CI, (1.001-1.005)], p = 0.013) were identified as risk factors for pNCD. On average, patients scored higher on postoperative tests (mean z-score 2.35[± 3.13]). In this cohort, duration of anaesthesia, which is probably an expression of the complexity of the surgery, was the only anaesthesia-related predictor of pNCD. On average, patients' scores on cognitive tests improved postoperatively.},

RIC consisted of 4 × 5-min thigh occlusion by an inflatable tourniquet each followed by 5-min deflation, performed during surgery prior to graft reperfusion. The tourniquet remained deflated for sham-RIC. The primary endpoint was the estimated time to a 50% decrease in baseline plasma creatinine (tCr50) calculated from plasma creatinine measurements 30 days posttransplant or 30 days after the last, posttransplant dialysis. No significant differences were observed between RIC and sham-RIC-treated patients in the primary outcome median tCr50 (122 h [95% confidence interval [CI] 98-151] vs. 112 h [95% CI 91-139], p = 0.58), or the number of patients receiving dialysis in the first posttransplant week (33% vs. 35%, p = 0.71).

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of SCS' drawbacks remain poorly understood. One of the mechanisms that drives delayed graft function (DGF) and poorer transplant outcomes is suggested to entail increased oxidative stress due to prolonged cold ischemia, thus driving lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis via iron-mediated Fenton chemistry. Here, we investigate whether iron chelation with deferasirox can prevent the Fenton reaction and thereby mitigate lipid peroxidation and improve kidney preservation. Porcine kidneys underwent 24 h of SCS in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution with or without deferasirox (60 µmol), followed by 3 h of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Deferasirox-treated kidneys exhibited significantly lower lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by reduced 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4HNE)-protein adduct levels, without altering antioxidative capacity manifested by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) expression. Metabolic stability was enhanced, with increased glucose availability and a higher glucose-to-lactate ratio, suggesting improved oxidative phosphorylation. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels remained stable, indicating no adverse mitochondrial effects. Additionally, deferasirox reduced kidney weight gain, which may reflect lower edema formation, and strongly improved glomerular integrity and reduced tubular dilation. By reducing lipid peroxidation and maintaining metabolic function, deferasirox may help mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), enhance early graft function, and improve transplant outcomes. These findings strengthen the role of iron in cold-induced oxidative damage, and imply that iron chelation is a promising adjunct to improve graft preservation.},

Understanding the signaling transduction pathways of renal ischemic conditioning can promote further clinical translation and pharmacological advancements in this era. This review summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms underlying both local and remote ischemic pre-, per- and postconditioning of the kidney. The different types of conditioning strategies in the kidney recruit similar powerful pro-survival mechanisms.

This is an ongoing debate since more than 25 years, representing a scientific, cultural as well as geographical divide in the anesthesia community. The Pro side argues that total intravenous anesthesia causes less postoperative nausea and higher patient satisfaction than anesthesia using volatile anesthetics. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of anesthetic agents allows for better titration of intravenous anesthesia using pharmacokinetic models. Processed EEG monitors, such as bispectral index monitoring, allows for better assessing the effect of TCI anesthesia than solely assessment of clinical parameters, such as ECG or blood pressure. The combination of TCI propofol and objective depth of anesthesia monitoring allows creating a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile for each patient. Finally, anesthesia using volatile anesthetics poses health risks for healthcare professionals and contributes to greenhouse effect. The Con side argues that for procedures accompanied with ischemia and reperfusion injury of an organ or tissue and for patients suffering from a severe inflammation' the use of volatile anesthetics might well have its advantages above propofol. In times of sudden shortage of drugs, volatile anesthetics can overcome the restriction in the operating theater or even on the intensive care unit, which is another advantage. Volatile anesthetics can be used for induction of anesthesia when IV access is impossible, end-tidal measurements of volatile anesthetic concentration allows confirmation that patients receive anesthetics. Taking environmental considerations into account, both propofol and volatile anesthetics bear certain harm to the environment, be it as waste product or as greenhouse gases. The authors therefore suggest to carefully considering advantages and disadvantages for each patient in its according environment. A well-balanced choice based on the available literature is recommended. The authors recommend careful consideration of advantages and disadvantages of each technique when tailoring an anesthetic to meet patient needs. Where appropriate, anesthesia providers are encouraged to account for unique features of anesthetic drug behavior, patient-reported and observed postoperative outcomes, and economic and environmental considerations when choosing any of the 2 described techniques.},

Postoperative complications were measured by the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Using a linear regression model, 30-day postoperative complications and frailty correlation were adjusted for confounders, including sex, age, ASA Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, BMI, smoking, dialysis, duration of dialysis, type of transplantation, and retransplantation. The mean frailty score was 2.07(±1.6) and 23 patients were classified as frail (GFI ≥4).

The primary endpoint is the incidence of delayed graft function in recipients of DCD and DBD donor kidneys and/or 1-year biopsy-proven and treated acute rejection. Secondary endpoints include functional delayed graft function defined as failure of serum creatinine levels to decrease by at least 10% per day for three consecutive days; primary non-function is defined as a permanent lack of function of the allograft; length of hospital stay and postoperative complications of all kinds, estimated glomerular filtration rate at 1 week and 3 and 12 months calculated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula; readmissions at 3 and 12 months, graft survival and all-cause mortality at 12 months. The study is approved by the local ethical committees and national data security agencies. Results are expected to be published in 2025. NCT02727296.},

The following abstracts are from the Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Scientific and Educational Symposium held virtually in October 2020. Aspects of behavior, including autistic features, impulsivity, adaptive skills, executive function, and anxiety are described. Applied behavioral analysis is a promising approach for autism, and an N-acetylcysteine trial is proposed. Children below 6 years with CdLS have an increased number of and further travel to medical providers, with insurance type comprising a significant barrier. Speech, language, and feeding abilities fall significantly below expectations for age in CdLS. Augmentative alternative communication can yield potential barriers as well as interesting benefits. Developmentally, studies in animal models further elucidate the mechanisms and roles of cohesin: link with mediator transcriptional complex; facilitation of enhancer-promoter communication; regulation of gene expression; allocation of cells to germ layers; and repair of spontaneous DNA damage in placental cells. Genome and RNA sequencing can help identify the molecular cause in the 20% of individuals with suspected CdLS and negative testing. The phenotypes in individuals with variants in the SMC1A gene are distinct, and that with intractable seizures has been further evaluated. AMA CME credits provided by GBMC, Baltimore, MD.

Subjects were overweight (BMI>27) patients with type 2 diabetes (52% female) from a Dutch hospital (mean age 58.14, S.D.=8.86). No differences in the outcomes were found between the intervention and control groups at 3 (T2) or 6 (T3) months. However, results at T2 and T3 revealed that patients with higher SR-skills scores had lower HbA1c levels than patients with lower scores. The SR-intervention did not significantly influence the outcomes. This apparent lack of effect might, however, partly be due to high attrition rates in all treatment groups. SR-skills were positively related to changes in HbA1c-levels. Improving SR-skills of overweight diabetes type 2 patients may improve their glycemic control. Patients who are 'external regulators' may however profit more from directive than from SR-interventions.},

Despite a lack of explicit communication, expectations of parents and siblings regarding future responsibilities corresponded. However, some siblings mentioned the lack of explicit communication made them feel unprepared for the future.

Results of questionnaire studies are compared to those in individuals with Down Syndrome and with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Results on cognition and self-injurious behaviour (SIB) are compared to those in individuals with CdLS caused by NIPBL variants. For Dutch participants with SMC1A variants we performed direct in-person assessments of cognition, autism, and added an interview and questionnaire on adaptive behaviour and sensory processing. Individuals with SMC1A variants show a higher cognitive level and less SIB than individuals with NIPBL variants. Individuals with SMC1A variants without classic CdLS phenotype but with a Rett-like phenotype show more severe intellectual disability and more SIB compared to those with a CdLS phenotype. Autism is less present if outcomes in direct in-person assessments are evaluated taking developmental level into account compared to results based on a questionnaire. Behaviour in individuals with CdLS should be evaluated taking genetic cause into account. Detailed interdisciplinary approaches are of clinical importance to inform tailored care and may eventually improve quality of life of patients and families.},

We examined whether middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients show reduced white matter integrity in fiber tracts important for cognition and whether this abnormality is related to preestablished altered resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN). Diabetic and nondiabetic participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessment. Multiple diffusion measures were calculated using streamline tractography, and correlations with DMN functional connectivity were determined. Diabetic patients showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (a measure of white matter integrity) in the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus. Control subjects showed stronger functional connectivity than patients between the posterior cingulate and both left fusiform and medial frontal gyri. FA of the cingulum bundle was correlated with functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus for combined groups. Thus, middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes show white matter abnormalities that correlate with disrupted functional connectivity in the DMN, suggesting that common mechanisms may underlie structural and functional connectivity. Detecting brain abnormalities in middle age enables implementation of therapies to slow progression of neuropathology.},

Only described in female patients, SMC1A epilepsy syndrome is characterized by the onset of severe refractory epileptic seizures in the first year of life, global developmental delay, a variable degree of intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features not typical of CdLS. This was a descriptive observational study for the largest international cohort with this specific disorder. The main goal of this study was to improve the knowledge of the natural history of this phenotype with particular attention to the psychomotor development and the epilepsy data. The analyzed cohort shows normal prenatal growth with the subsequent development of postnatal microcephaly. The incidence of neonatal problems (seizures and respiratory compromise) is considerable (51.4%). There is a significant prevalence of central nervous system (20%) and cardiovascular malformations (20%). Motor skills are generally delayed. The presence of drug-resistant epilepsy is confirmed; the therapeutic role of a ketogenic diet is still uncertain. The significant regression of previously acquired skills following the onset of seizures has been observed. Facial dysmorphisms are variable and no patient shows a classic CdLS phenotype. To sum up, SMC1A variants caused drug-resistant epilepsy in these patients, more than two-thirds of whom were shown to progress to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The SMC1A gene variants are all different from each other (apart from a couple of monozygotic twins), demonstrating the absence of a mutational hotspot in the SMC1A gene. Owing to the absence of phenotypic specificity, whole-exome sequencing is currently the diagnostic gold standard.},

We performed an international, interdisciplinary study on 51 individuals with SMC1A variants for physical and behavioral characteristics, and compare results to those in 67 individuals with NIPBL variants. For the Netherlands all known individuals with SMC1A variants were studied, both with and without CdLS phenotype. Individuals with SMC1A variants can resemble CdLS, but manifestations are less marked compared to individuals with NIPBL variants: growth is less disturbed, facial signs are less marked (except for periocular signs and thin upper vermillion), there are no major limb anomalies, and they have a higher level of cognitive and adaptive functioning. Self-injurious behavior is more frequent and more severe in the NIPBL group. In the Dutch group 5 of 13 individuals (all females) had a phenotype that shows a remarkable resemblance to Rett syndrome: epileptic encephalopathy, severe or profound intellectual disability, stereotypic movements, and (in some) regression. Their missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations are evenly spread over the gene. We conclude that SMC1A variants can result in a phenotype resembling CdLS and a phenotype resembling Rett syndrome. Resemblances between the SMC1A group and the NIPBL group suggest that a disturbed cohesin function contributes to the phenotype, but differences between these groups may also be explained by other underlying mechanisms such as moonlighting of the cohesin genes.},

A clinical trial was conducted with 101 overweight/obese (body mass index >27) diabetes type 2 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to a self-regulation intervention, an active control group, and a passive control group. Psychological, somatic, socio-demographic, and lifestyle variables were examined as predictors of drop-out from baseline to 6 months follow-up. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that low autonomous regulation or low 'goal ownership' was the best predictor of drop-out. It is suggested that the assessment of 'goal ownership' prior to a weight reduction intervention could identify patients who are sufficiently motivated to participate. Patients who score low on 'goal ownership' may be offered pretreatment interventions to increase their motivation.},

We propose a template-based digital intervention design mechanism enabling the configuration of evidence-based, just-in-time, adaptive intervention components. The design mechanism incorporates a rule definition language enabling experts to specify triggering conditions for interventions based on momentary and historical contextual/personal data. The framework continuously monitors and processes personal data space and evaluates intervention-triggering conditions. We benefit from reinforcement learning methods to develop personalized intervention delivery strategies with respect to timing, frequency, and type (content) of interventions. To validate the personalization algorithm, we lay out a simulation testbed with 2 personas, differing in their various simulated real-life conditions. We evaluate the design mechanism by presenting example intervention definitions based on behavior change taxonomies and clinical guidelines. Furthermore, we provide intervention definitions for a real-world care program targeting diabetes patients. Finally, we validate the personalized delivery mechanism through a set of hypotheses, asserting certain ways of adaptation in the delivery strategy, according to the differences in simulation related to personal preferences, traits, and lifestyle patterns. While the design mechanism is sufficiently expandable to meet the theoretical and clinical intervention design requirements, the personalization algorithm is capable of adapting intervention delivery strategies for simulated real-life conditions.},

We formed an international, multidisciplinary working group that developed an accessible questionnaire including key issues about adults with RTS and disseminated this to all known RTS support groups via social media. We report the observations from a cohort of 87 adult individuals of whom 43 had a molecularly confirmed diagnosis. The adult natural history of RTS is defined by prevalent behavioural/psychiatric problems (83%), gastrointestinal problems (73%) that are represented mainly by constipation; and sleep problems (62%) that manifest in a consistent pattern of sleep apnoea, difficulty staying asleep and an increased need for sleep. Furthermore, over than half of the RTS individuals (65%) had skin and adnexa-related problems. Half of the individuals receive multidisciplinary follow-up and required surgery at least once, and most frequently more than once, during adulthood. Our data confirm that adults with RTS enjoy both social and occupational possibilities, show a variegated experience of everyday life but experience a significant morbidity and ongoing medical issues which do not appear to be as coordinated and multidisciplinary managed as in paediatric patients. We highlight the need for optimal care in a multidisciplinary setting including the pivotal role of specialists for adult care.},

Several explorative studies have applied linear dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and classical Multi-Dimensional Scaling (cMDS) to gain insight into the spatial organization of these expression patterns. In this paper, we describe a non-linear embedding technique called Barnes-Hut Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH-SNE) that emphasizes the local similarity structure of high-dimensional data points. By applying BH-SNE to the gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlases, we demonstrate the consistency of the 2D, non-linear embedding of the sagittal and coronal mouse brain atlases, and across 6 human brains. In addition, we quantitatively show that BH-SNE maps are superior in their separation of neuroanatomical regions in comparison to PCA and cMDS. Finally, we assess the effect of higher-order principal components on the global structure of the BH-SNE similarity maps. Based on our observations, we conclude that BH-SNE maps with or without prior dimensionality reduction (based on PCA) provide comprehensive and intuitive insights in both the local and global spatial transcriptome structure of the human and mouse Allen Brain Atlases.},

There is increasing attention for somatic substrates of behavior in genetic syndromes, and growing evidence of an association between pain and discomfort with SIB in people with ID and genetic syndromes. In this review on SIB phenomenology in people with ID in general and in twelve genetic syndromes, we summarize different SIB characteristics across these etiologically distinct entities and identify influencing factors. We demonstrate that the prevalence of SIB in several well-known genetic intellectual disability syndromes is noticeably higher than in individuals with ID in general, and that characteristics such as age of onset and topographies differ widely across syndromes. Each syndrome is caused by a mutation in a different gene, and this allows detection of several pathways that lead to SIB. Studying these with the behavioral consequences as specific aim will be an important step toward targeted early interventions and prevention.},

However, how lipidation at different sites in a membrane protein affects structure and function remains elusive. Here, using native mass spectrometry we determined that wild-type human tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 exhibit nonstochastic distributions of bound acyl chains. We revealed CD9 lipidation at its three most frequent lipidated sites suffices for EWI-F binding, while cysteine-to-alanine CD9 mutations markedly reduced binding of EWI-F. EWI-F binding by CD9 was rescued by mutating all or, albeit to a lesser extent, only the three most frequently lipidated sites into tryptophans. These mutations did not affect the nanoscale distribution of CD9 in cell membranes, as shown by super-resolution microscopy using a CD9-specific nanobody. Thus, these data demonstrate site-specific, possibly conformation-dependent, functionality of lipidation in tetraspanin CD9 and identify tryptophan mimicry as a possible biochemical approach to study site-specific transmembrane-protein lipidation.},

The presence of disease exacerbates this further, increasing the need for an automated solution. To this extent, SynthSeg is a robust deep learning model designed for automatic brain segmentation across various contrasts and resolutions. This study validates the SynthSeg robust brain segmentation model on computed tomography (CT), using a multi-center dataset. An open access dataset of 260 paired CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from radiotherapy patients treated in 5 centers was collected. Brain segmentations from CT and MRI were obtained with SynthSeg model, a component of the Freesurfer imaging suite. These segmentations were compared and evaluated using Dice scores and Hausdorff 95 distance (HD95), treating MRI-based segmentations as the ground truth. Brain regions that failed to meet performance criteria were excluded based on automated quality control (QC) scores. Dice scores indicate a median overlap of 0.76 (IQR: 0.65-0.83). The mean volume difference is 7.79% (CI: 6.41%-9.18%), with CT segmentations typically smaller than MRI-based. The median HD95 is 2.95 mm (IQR: 1.73-5.39). QC score based thresholding improves median dice by 0.1 and median HD95 by 0.05 mm. Morphological differences related to sex and age, as detected by MRI, were also replicated with CT, with an approximate 17% difference between the CT and MRI results for sex and 10% difference between the results for age. SynthSeg can be utilized for CT-based automatic brain segmentation, but only in applications where precision is not essential. CT performance is lower than MRI based on the integrated QC scores, but low-quality segmentations can be excluded with QC-based thresholding. Additionally, performing CT-based neuroanatomical studies is encouraged, as the results show correlations in sex- and age-based analyses similar to those found with MRI.},

We conducted an interpretative synthesis of literature on tacit knowledge in caregiving dyads with persons with PIMD, persons with dementia or infants. Twelve studies were included. Tacit knowledge is about caregivers and care-recipients becoming sensitive and responsive to each other's cues and together crafting care routines. Learning takes place in a constant process of action and response that transforms those involved. Building tacit knowledge together is necessary for persons with PIMD to learn to recognise and express their needs. Suggestions are made for ways to facilitate its development and transfer.},

Descriptive anatomic study. Ten knees from 8 cadavers were dissected and the PCL was identified. The ligament was peeled away from its insertion and the sides of the insertion site were measured and recorded. The 4 corners of the insertion site were identified and marked. Observations were made of the morphology of the insertion site and the presence of any reproducible anatomic landmarks. A note was made of landmarks that could be easily identified on all of the specimens by direct vision and by palpation with a probe. The ligament consisted of 2 regions, 1 anterolateral, and 1 posteromedial, with a gradual change in the laxity of the ligament as the knee was passed through flexion and extension. The insertion site was situated in a depression between the plateaus of the tibia and extended below the articular surface. The average length +/- standard deviation of the 4 sides was 128 +/- 21.2 mm (medial side), 107 +/- 26.5 mm (superior side), 160 +/- 30.0 mm (lateral side), and 169 +/- 34.5 mm (inferior side). The shape and sides of the insertion site were visually similar among the 10 specimens. The superolateral and superomedial corners were both represented by depressions and a reproducible ridge represented the inferior border. These structures could be visualized as well as palpated on all specimens. Based on the findings of this study, we describe the anatomic characteristics of the tibial footprint of the PCL. Anatomic reference points that represent the corners of the tibial insertion of the PCL were identified by direct vision or palpation consistently on all specimens included in the study. These reference points could potentially aid in the placement of an anterolateral and posteromedial tibial tunnel for a 2 tibial tunnel PCL reconstruction. Reproducible anatomic reference points exist at the tibial insertion of the PCL that can be identified by direct vision and palpation. These reference points may potentially aid in the placement of separate tibial tunnels for a 2-bundle PCL reconstruction.},

A device to deliver bone graft evenly throughout the tibial tunnel was developed. Forty mature sheep underwent simulated quadruple hamstring tendon-ACL reconstruction by use of a bioresorbable interference screw, either with or without bone graft augmentation of the tibial tunnel. Endpoint data were derived at time 0 and after 6 weeks in vivo. Radiostereometric analysis provided quantitation of the translational characteristics; computed tomography evaluated tunnel volume, and measures of yield strength and stiffness were obtained. Sequential fluorochrome administration assessed bone formation, and light microscopy surveyed the biological response. Radiostereometric analysis highlighted differences in the translational characteristics of ACL-deficient knees when compared with intact knees. Reconstructed knees (with or without autograft) showed significantly greater translation when compared with unoperated knees at 6 weeks; autograft bone augmentation provided no benefit. Neither tunnel volume nor yield strength nor stiffness was improved with the addition of autograft bone. No untoward histologic responses were observed. Bone apposition rates were similar between treatment groups. An even distribution of bone graft throughout the tunnels was observed. This model has confirmed the ability of the bone graft-delivery system to evenly distribute bone graft throughout the tunnels. However, the study has failed to show improvement in stability or fixation strength after augmentation with autograft bone. The autograft bone-delivery system may provide a means of establishing an osteoconductive/inductive environment. At this early juncture (6 weeks), no benefit could be defined. Its use in combination with bone morphogenetic proteins or stem cells may provide more rapid fixation, rehabilitation, and reconstitution of bone volume within the tunnel.},

After completion the replies were entered on the PRINTO website. Replies could either be entered directly by parents on the website or on paper. In these cases, the replies were scanned and emailed by local hospital staff to Utrecht where they were entered by I.R. in the database. The survey was completed by 622 parents in 23 countries. The majority (66.7%) of patients were female, with median age 10-11 years at the completion of the questionnaire. Frequencies of self-reported JIA categories corresponded to literature. Some patients had never been referred to the ophthalmologist (22.8%) or physiotherapist (31.7%). Low rates of referral or access to fatigue (3.5%) or pain management teams (10.0%), age appropriate disease education (11.3%), special rehabilitation (13.7%) and support groups (20.1%) were observed.

While on immunosuppressive drugs, about one half of patients did not receive information about immunizations, travelling, possible infections or how to deal with chickenpox or shingles. Low rates of referral to health care professionals may be due to children whose illness is well managed and who do not need additional support or information. Improvements are needed, especially in the areas of supportive care and information patients receive. It is also important to improve doctor patient communication between visits. Physicians can be instrumental in the setting up of support groups and increasing patients' awareness of existing support. Suggestions are given to convey crucial pieces of information structurally and repeatedly to ensure, among other things, compliance.},

As in many areas of daily life, digitalization is becoming increasingly important in the medical field amid the exponential rise in the use of computers and smartphones.

An online survey entitled "Digital online Patient Informed Consent for Anesthesia before Elective Surgery. Recent practice in Europe," with a total of 27 questions, was sent by the European Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) to their members in 47 European countries. To assess the effect of the economy on digitalization and legal status with regard to anesthesia consent, data were stratified based on gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC). In total, 23.1% and 37.2% of the 930 participants indicated that it was possible to obtain consent online or via telephone, respectively. This observation was more often reported in countries with high GDPPC levels than in countries with low GDPPC levels. Furthermore, 27.3% of the responses for simple anesthesia, 18.7% of the responses for complex anesthesia, and 32.2% of the responses for repeated anesthesia indicated that remote consent was in accordance with the law, and this was especially prevalent in countries with high GDPPC. Concerning the timing of consent, patients were informed at least one day before in 67.1% of cases for simple procedures and in 85.2% of cases for complex procedures. Even European countries with high GDPPC use remote informed consent only in a minority of cases, and most of the time for repeated anesthetic procedures.

Venous oxygen saturations represent this relationship between oxygen delivery and oxygen demand and can therefore be used as an additional parameter to detect an impaired cardiorespiratory reserve. Before appropriate use of venous oxygen saturations, however, one should be aware of the physiology. Although venous oxygen saturation has been the subject of research for many years, increasing interest arose especially in the past decade for its use as a therapeutic goal in critically ill patients and during the perioperative period. Also, there has been debate on differences between mixed and central venous oxygen saturation and their interchangeability. Both mixed and central venous oxygen saturation are clinically useful but both variables should be used with insightful knowledge and caution. In general, low values warn the clinician about cardiocirculatory or metabolic impairment and should urge further diagnostics and appropriate action, whereas normal or high values do not rule out persistent tissue hypoxia. The use of venous oxygen saturations seems especially useful in the early phase of disease or injury. Whether venous oxygen saturations should be measured continuously remains unclear. Especially, continuous measurement of central venous oxygen saturation as part of the treatment protocol has been shown a valuable strategy in the emergency department and in cardiac surgery. In clinical practice, venous oxygen saturations should always be used in combination with vital signs and other relevant endpoints.},

The challenges they face are twofold: coping with changes in tasks or responsibilities and performing (new) social roles. This process of 'learning the ropes' is known as Organizational Socialization (OS). Although there is substantial literature on transitions from the perspective of residents, the voices of program directors (PDs) who facilitate and guide residents through the organizational socialization process have not yet been explored. PDs' perspectives are important, since PDs are formally responsible for Postgraduate Medical Education (PGME) and contribute, directly or indirectly, to residents' socialization process. Using the lens of OS, we explored what strategies PDs use to facilitate organizational socialization of newcomer residents. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 PDs of different specialties. We used a theory-informing inductive data analysis study design, comprising an inductive thematic analysis, a deductive interpretation of the results through the lens of OS and, subsequently, an inductive analysis to identify overarching insights. We identified six strategies PDs used to facilitate organizational socialization of newcomer residents and uncovered two overarching insights. First, PDs varied in the extent to which they planned their guidance. Some PDs planned socialization as an explicit learning objective and assigned residents' tasks and responsibilities accordingly, making it an intended program outcome. However, socialization was also facilitated by social interactions in the workplace, making it an unintended program outcome. Second, PDs varied in the extent to which they adapted their strategies to the newcomer residents. Some PDs used individualized strategies tailored to individual residents' needs and skills, particularly in cases of poor performance, by broaching and discussing the issue or adjusting tasks and responsibilities. However, PDs also used workplace strategies requiring residents to adjust to the workplace without much intervention, which was often viewed as an implicit expectation. PDs' used both intentional and unintentional strategies to facilitate socialization in residents, which may imply that socialization can occur irrespective of the PD's strategy. PDs' strategies varied from an individual-centered to a workplace-centered approach to socialization. Further research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of residents' perceptions of PD's efforts to facilitate their socialization process during transitions.},

  abstract = {Well-being at work can be defined as "creating an environment to promote a state of contentment which allows an employee to flourish and achieve their full potential for the benefit of themselves and their organisation." In the health care context, well-being at work of nurses and doctors is important for good patient care. Moreover, it is strongly associated with individual- and organization-level consequences. Relevant literature presents models and concepts of physical, mental, and social well-being. This study uses the 6 elements of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model to interpret well-being at work (job demands, job resources, personal resources, leadership, well-being, and outcomes) as part of a Netherlands Federation of University Medical Hospitals program to find ways to improve and monitor health care professionals' well-being in Dutch hospitals. Many instruments exist to measure well-being at work in terms of population, setting, and other aspects. An overview of available and eligible instruments assessing and monitoring the well-being of nurses and doctors is currently missing. We will perform a scoping review aiming to provide an overview of validated instruments assessing and monitoring the well-being of nurses and doctors at work. We will perform a search of published literature in the following databases: Medline, Embase, and CINAHL. Studies will be eligible if they (1) assess well-being at work of nurses and doctors employed in hospitals; (2) describe an evaluation of an instrument or review an instrument; (3) measure well-being at work or aspects of well-being at work according to the elements of the JD-R model, and (4) were published in English from 2011 onwards. Title/abstract screening according to the eligibility criteria will be followed by full-text screening. Data extraction of included studies will be conducted by 3 reviewers independently. Reviewers will use standardized data extraction forms that include study characteristics, sample characteristics, measurement instrument details, and psychometric properties. The analysis will be descriptive. When synthesizing the data, a distinction will be made between comprehensive instruments and common instruments. This scoping review identifies instruments that have been developed and validated for monitoring the well-being of nurses and doctors at work. Studies were searched between September and December 2021 and screened between December 2021 and May 2022. A total of 739 studies were included. Timely screening of well-being at work may be beneficial for individual health care workers, the organization, and patients. There is often a substantial gap and mismatch between employer perceptions of well-being and well-being interventions. It is important to develop and implement suitable interventions adapted to the needs of nurses and doctors and their health or other problems. Well-being screening should be timely to gain insight into these needs and problems. Moreover, to determine the effectiveness of well-being interventions, measurement is mandatory. The results will be critical for organizations to select a monitoring instrument that best fits the needs of employees and organizations. DERR1-10.2196/43692.},

The Jobs Demands Resources (JD-R) model offers a framework for health at work, encompassing 'job demands', 'job resources', 'personal resources', 'leadership', 'well-being' and 'outcomes'. While various instruments exist to measure health, an overview of instruments specifically designed for assessing nurses and doctors health is currently missing. This study provides a comprehensive overview of available health instruments specifically developed and validated for healthcare professionals in hospital care. Scoping review. MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. Studies assessing the health of nurses and/or doctors in hospitals using or evaluating instruments based on the JD-R model, published between January 2011 and January 2024, excluding student-exclusive samples. We extracted data on study and sample characteristics, as well as details of the measurement instruments, including main and subconstructs. Instruments were categorised based on the JD-R model domains. Descriptive analysis and data visualisation were performed using Excel and Python. We included 1204 studies, reporting 986 unique instruments. We identified 32 comprehensive instruments suitable for broad health screening, measuring four or more of the JD-R model domains. Additionally, we identified instruments focusing on specific domains for targeted screening needs. Furthermore, we present frequently reported instruments assumed to be extensively evaluated, user-friendly, accessible and available in multiple languages. Health at work cannot be determined by a single instrument alone, underscoring the multidimensional nature of workplace health. Alternatively, organisations should select instruments based on domains most relevant and applicable to their context. This approach ensures a more comprehensive assessment of health at work.},

An international survey was sent to veterinarians to understand individual fracture characteristics and management strategies as they relate to outcomes, with the goal of better informing treatment procedures. The data set consisted of 79 fractures from 64 elephants (including Asian and African males and females), 44.3% of which were Class III fractures with pulpal involvement. Of this subset, pulp canal exposures of >0.5 cm were 23.8-fold more likely to develop pulpitis than fractures with <0.5 cm exposed, though canal size did not impact healing versus extraction outcome. Odds ratios showed that treatments including endodontics were 12.0-fold more likely to heal than tusks treated exclusively with medical management, though no association was observed in reducing the risk of pulpitis. Further, pulpitis was 7.58-fold more likely to develop when tap water was used to rinse exposed pulpal tissue; a finding that merits further investigation. The use of endodontic treatment versus medical management alone was significantly associated with improved recovery outcomes (i.e., reduced risk of extraction) in tusk fractures with pulpal involvement.},

One cycle of IVF-eSET or three cycles of IUI-COS. Ongoing pregnancy per couple. We randomly allocated 116 women to IVF-eSET (n = 58) or IUI-COH (n = 58). There were 14 ongoing pregnancies (24%) in the IVF-eSET group and 12 pregnancies (21%) in the IUI-COS group (relative ratio 1.17; 95% confidence interval 0.60-2.30). There were two twin pregnancies in the IVF-eSET group (14%) and two twin pregnancies and one triplet pregnancy in the IUI-COH group (25%). In patients with unexplained or mild male subfertility and a poor prognosis for natural conception, one cycle of IVF-eSET might be as effective as three cycles of IUI-COS as primary treatment. Elective single embryo transfer does not seem an effective strategy in preventing multiple pregnancies in this particular population. In the future a strict SET policy (i.e., compulsory SET) might be an option. Our trial provides evidence for the feasibility and highlights the importance of a large definitive trial to determine the effectiveness and side effects of both strategies.},

Between January 2002 and February 2004, we prospectively included consecutive subfertile couples who had not been evaluated previously for subfertility. We estimated the contribution of the PCT result to the existing prediction model for spontaneous pregnancy by calculating the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of an abnormal PCT result. We constructed a second prediction model (PCT model) based on the reference model including the PCT. Primary endpoint in this study was ongoing pregnancy. We evaluated the performance of the PCT model in comparison with the reference model by calculating goodness of fit, discrimination, calibration, and the "net reclassification improvement". We included 3,021 couples of whom 537 (18%) had a spontaneous pregnancy and 55 (1.8%) a nonsuccessful pregnancy; 1,316 (44%) started treatment within 12 months, 824 (27%) neither started treatment nor became pregnant, and 289 (10%) became lost to follow-up within 12 months. The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62 to 0.94). The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.84) in case of no spermatozoa, 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57 to 1.2) in case of nonmotile spermatozoa, and 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.8) in case of motile, nonprogressive spermatozoa. Adding the PCT result to the reference model did not improve goodness of fit. Discrimination was equally poor for the PCT model and the reference model. The calibration plots of both models showed comparably good calibration. The net reclassification improvement of the predictions of the PCT model compared with the reference model was -1.1%. This study demonstrated that the PCT has prognostic value but does not add substantially to a prognostic model for spontaneous pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Multiple pregnancies are high risk pregnancies with higher chances of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. In the past decades the number of multiple pregnancies has increased. This trend is partly due to the fact that women start family planning at an increased age, but also due to the increased use of ART.Couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility generally receive intrauterine insemination IUI with controlled hormonal stimulation (IUI COH). The cumulative pregnancy rate is 40%, with a 10% multiple pregnancy rate.This study aims to reveal whether alternative treatments such as IVF elective Single Embryo Transfer (IVF e SET) or Modified Natural Cycle IVF (MNC IVF) can reduce the number of multiple pregnancy rates, but uphold similar pregnancy rates as IUI COH in couples with mild male or unexplained subfertility. Secondly, the aim is to perform a cost effective analyses and assess treatment preference of these couples. We plan a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of intra-uterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation or six cycles of Modified Natural Cycle (MNC) IVF or three cycles with IVF-elective Single Embryo Transfer (eSET) plus cryo-cycles within a time frame of 12 months.Couples with unexplained subfertility or mild male subfertility and a poor prognosis for treatment independent pregnancy will be included. Women with anovulatory cycles, severe endometriosis, double sided tubal pathology or serious endocrine illness will be excluded.Our primary outcome is the birth of a healthy singleton. Secondary outcomes are multiple pregnancy, treatment costs, and patient experiences in each treatment arm. The analysis will be performed according tot the intention to treat principle. We will test for non-inferiority of the three arms with respect to live birth. As we accept a 12.5% loss in pregnancy rate in one of the two IVF arms to prevent multiple pregnancies, we need 200 couples per arm (600 couples in total). Determining the safest and most cost-effective treatment will ensure optimal chances of pregnancy for subfertile couples with substantially diminished perinatal and maternal complications. Should patients find the most cost-effective treatment acceptable or even preferable, this could imply the need for a world wide shift in the primary treatment.

Control measurements were made in four animals in which the vascular clamp was not adjusted. Fetal PaO2 fell from 20.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 16.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg within 1 hour after application of the clamp and remained suppressed during 48 hours. There was a transient acidemia at 1 to 2 hours that had corrected by 8 hours. Fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone levels rose from 24 +/- 6 to 1320 +/- 205 pg/ml at 2 hours but decreased by 16 hours. Measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, more than 95% of immunoreactivity corresponded to adrenocorticotropic hormone1-39. Fetal cortisol levels rose by 6 hours and remained elevated through 48 hours. Maternal adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and progesterone levels were unchanged during the study period. We conclude that fetal hypoxemia-acidemia after restriction of uterine blood flow provokes fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone release, but the elevation in adrenocorticotropic hormone is not sustained. However, the level of fetal cortisol rises progressively, consistent with fetal adrenal activation.},

Immunoreactive ACTH was observed in the oocytes of ovaries from humans, cows, pigs, pregnant and non-pregnant sheep, but not from cats or rats. Positive staining of oocytes was associated with all tertiary and secondary follicles, and some primary follicles. There was no apparent difference in the pattern of staining between pregnant and non-pregnant sheep. Staining for ir-ACTH was absent in ovaries from fetal sheep. We conclude that ir-ACTH is present in ovarian tissue, and in particular the oocyte, from several species of mammal.

Findings at THL were compared with findings at diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopies. Tubal occlusion, endometriosis and adhesions were defined as abnormalities. Out of 1119 women, 1103 women underwent THL. A complete evaluation or incomplete but diagnostic procedure could be performed in 989 (89.7%) and 28 (2.5%), respectively. An incomplete non-diagnostic procedure was performed in 11 (1.0%) women. Failure of THL occurred in 75 women (6.8%) and 40 of these women (3.6%) subsequently underwent laparoscopy. Laparoscopy was performed in a total of 126 patients with a median time interval of 7 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 3-13 weeks). Of 64 patients who successfully underwent both THL and laparoscopy, concordant findings were found in 53 women and discordant results in 11 women, 6 of which were caused by tubal spasm. Sensitivity of THL in detecting abnormalities was 100% and specificity was 22.2%, with a likelihood ratio of 1.29. THL in an outpatient setting can detect anatomical abnormalities comparable to the more invasive reference standard diagnostic laparoscopy. If THL succeeds, there is no need to add a diagnostic laparoscopy in the work-up.},

The retinas were exposed to white light (400-740 nm) at intensities between 65 and 140 mW/cm2 for 1 h. Two days after exposure, the increased leakage of fluorescein measured with vitreous fluorophotometry could be mimicked on electron microscopy by the tracers ferrous gluconate and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In cases of minimal fluorescein leakage, traces of HRP were found in the basal folds of the retina pigment epithelium (RPE). No HRP was observed apical to the tight junctions of the RPE cells. When there was a great amount of fluorescein leakage, HRP completely filled the RPE cytoplasm, the extracellular spaces, and several cells in the neuroretina. It is concluded that after exposure to low intensities of white light, blood-retina barrier dysfunction may be due to disruption of the RPE basal fold membrane, leading to increased transcellular passage. The intact tight junctions suggest the under these circumstances intercellular leakage is not a component of BRB dysfunction.},

If women do not conceive, treatment can be continued with gonadotropins or intra-uterine insemination (IUI). At present, it is unclear for how many cycles ovulation induction with CC should be repeated, and when to switch to ovulation induction with gonadotropins and/or IUI. We started a multicenter randomised controlled trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of CC plus intercourse or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus intercourse or six cycles of CC plus IUI or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus IUI.Women with WHO type II anovulation who ovulate but did not conceive after six ovulatory cycles of CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days will be included.Our primary outcome is birth of a healthy child resulting from a pregnancy that was established in the first eight months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and treatment costs. The analysis will be performed according to the intention to treat principle. Two comparisons will be made, one in which CC is compared to gonadotrophins and one in which the addition of IUI is compared to ovulation induction only. Assuming a live birth rate of 40% after CC, 55% after addition of IUI and 55% after ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, with an alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, we need to recruit 200 women per arm (800 women in total).An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee has criticized the data of the first 150 women and concluded that a sample size re-estimation should be performed after including 320 patients (i.e. 80 per arm). The trial will provide evidence on the most effective, safest and most cost effective treatment in women with WHO type II anovulation who do not conceive after six ovulatory cycles with CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days. This evidence could imply the need for changing our guidelines, which may cause a shift in large practice variation to evidence based primary treatment for these women.

In women with clomiphene-citrate resistant WHO group II anovulation, one of the treatment options is ovulation induction with exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH or follitropin). FSH is derived from urine or is produced as recombinant FSH. Two forms of recombinant FSH are available - follitropin alpha and follitropin beta. To evaluate the efficacy, safety, costs and acceptability of recombinant FSH, we performed a review to compare recombinant FSH with urinary-derived FSH products. Follitropin alpha, beta and urinary FSH products appeared to be equally effective in terms of pregnancy rates. Patient safety was also found to be comparable, as the incidence of side effects including multiple pregnancies was similar for all FSH products. In practice follitropin alpha and beta may be more convenient to use due to the ease of self-administration, but they are also more expensive than the urinary products.},

  abstract = {Is transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) non-inferior to hysterosalpingography (HSG) as a first-line tubal patency test in subfertile women in predicting the chance of conception leading to live birth? A multicentre, randomized controlled trial in four teaching hospitals in the Netherlands, which randomized subfertile women scheduled for tubal patency testing to either THL or HSG as a first-line tubal patency test. The primary outcome was conception leading to live birth within 24 months after randomization. A total of 149 women were randomized to THL and 151 to HSG. From the intention-to-treat population, 83 women from the THL group (58.5%) conceived and delivered a live born child within 24 months after randomization compared with 82 women (55.4%) in the HSG group (difference 3.0%, 95% CI -8.3 to 14.4). Time to conception leading to live birth was not statistically different between groups. Miscarriage occurred in 16 (11.3%) women in the THL group, versus 20 (13.5%) women in the HSG group (RR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.32, P = 0.237), and multiple pregnancies occurred in 12 (8.4%) women in the THL group compared with 19 (12.8%) women in the HSG group (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.55, P = 0.58). Ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed in two women in the HSG group (1.4%) and none in the THL group (P = 0.499). In a preselected group of subfertile women with a low risk of tubal pathology, use of THL was not inferior to HSG as a first-line test for predicting conception leading to live birth.},

This retrospective multicentre cohort study investigated the results of THL and subsequent pregnancy rates. Between 2000 and 2011, 1033 subfertile women participated in the study. The primary outcome measure was intrauterine pregnancy, either after natural conception or after treatment with intrauterine insemination or ovulation induction. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and fecundity rate ratios (FRR) were established. THL showed bilateral patent tubes in 83%, one-sided tubal occlusion in 12.4% and bilateral tubal occlusion in 4.6% of women. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates after 36 months were 52% for women with bilateral patent tubes, 44% for one-sided tubal occlusion (FRR 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.39) and 7% for bilateral tubal occlusion (FRR 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.43). Endometriosis was diagnosed in 6.4%, and adhesions in 9.1%, while 3.9% of women had both. Corresponding FRR were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.09), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.46 to 1.02) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.84). In conclusion, women with bilateral tubal occlusion or a combination of endometriosis and adhesions found on THL significantly reduced chances of natural conception.},

A European expert meeting was organized in Brussels, Belgium by the Benelux Neuromodulation Society in order to develop uniform MCS protocols in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses. An expert meeting was organized, and a questionnaire was sent out to all the invited participants before this expert meeting. An extensive literature research was conducted in order to enrich the results. Topics that were addressed during the expert meeting were 1) inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2) targeting and methods of stimulation, 3) effects of MCS, and 4) results from the questionnaire. Substantial commonalities but also important methodologic divergencies emerged from the discussion of MCS experts from 7 European Centers. From this meeting and questionnaire, all participants concluded that there is a need for more homogenous standardized protocols for MCS regarding patient selection, implantation procedure, stimulation parameters, and follow-up-course.},

So, in order to minimize invasiveness while optimizing repeatability, we sought to create an easily reproducible single-access port operative strategy. Four patients suffering from intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis for >10 years (12.8 ± 5.9) underwent a single-port unilateral R5-R11 splanchnotomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. No operative complications were observed. All 4 patients experienced excellent pain relief with a significant improvement of Visual Analogue Scale pain scores (8.8 ± 1.0 preoperatively to 3.0 ± 1.2 postoperatively, P = 0.003). We report the first series of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) splanchnotomy for palliation of intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis. From this small study, single-port VATS splanchnotomy seems to be a safe and effective alternative to multiportal or open procedures.},

The aim of this international questionnaire study was to assess patient-reported outcomes of this new treatment in GSD Ib patients. Patients and caregivers of pediatric patients were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire. This was designed to evaluate treatment effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on clinical symptoms and important aspects of daily life including physical performance, sleep, social and work life, traveling, socioeconomic aspects, and quality of life. The questionnaire was completed by 73 respondents from 17 different countries. The mean duration of treatment was 15 months, the cumulative treatment time was 94.8 years. More than 80% of patients reported an improved quality of life. The number of hospitalizations was reduced (66% of patients), as well as the number of days absent from school or work. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment could be stopped in 49% of patients and reduced in another 42%. Clear improvement of neutropenia and all neutropenia-associated symptoms was reported by the majority of patients. Additionally, patients or caregivers reported positive effects on appetite (63%), level of activity (75%), overall well-being (96%), and sleep (63%). Empagliflozin positively impacts many aspects of daily life including work and social life and thereby significantly improves quality of life of patients and caregivers.},

The two groups self-assessed their knowledge and skills as adequate. However, the control group (N=111) had significantly more difficulty in delivering chest compressions deeper than 4 cm (25 versus 1 candidate in the CPREzy group), P=0.0001. The control group compressed ineffectively in 36% (+/-41%) of all compressions as opposed to 6+/-13% in the CPREzy group (N=112, P=0.0001). If compressions were effective initially, the time until >50% of compressions were less than 4 cm deep was 75+/-81s in the control group versus 194+/-87 s in the CPREzy group (P=0.0001 [-180 to -57.5]). After a few seconds of training in its use, our candidates used the CPREzy effectively. Against the background knowledge that estimation of compression depth by the rescuer or other team members is difficult, and that performing effective compressions is the cornerstone of any resuscitation attempt, our data suggests that a feedback device such as the CPREzy should be used consistently during resuscitation.},

The molecular mechanisms that regulate disease onset and progression are largely unknown. In order to identify molecular pathways that are consistently associated with OPMD, we performed an integrated high-throughput transcriptome study in affected muscles of OPMD animal models and patients. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) was found to be the most consistently and significantly OPMD-deregulated pathway across species. We could correlate the association of the UPS OPMD-deregulated genes with stages of disease progression. The expression trend of a subset of these genes is age-associated and therefore, marks the late onset of the disease, and a second group with expression trends relating to disease-progression. We demonstrate a correlation between expression trends and entrapment into PABPN1 insoluble aggregates of OPMD-deregulated E3 ligases. We also show that manipulations of proteasome and immunoproteasome activity specifically affect the accumulation and aggregation of mutant PABPN1. We suggest that the natural decrease in proteasome expression and its activity during muscle aging contributes to the onset of the disease.},

Additionally, a systematic literature review has been performed to identify instruments to quantify patient-reported outcome measures of psychosocial problems in hepatic GSD patients. Sixteen patients from 12 families were included with ages ranging between 3 and 24 years. Five out of sixteen patients were diagnosed with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder and six patients showed characteristics of this disorder. Fourteen patients experienced sleeping problems, and 11 out of 12 parent couples experienced stress about the illness of their child. We subsequently identified 26 instruments to quantify patient-reported outcome measures for GSD patients. This study demonstrates that GSD patients can develop Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder influencing quality of life at multiple domains. The identification of instruments to assess psychosocial wellbeing is an important step towards a standard set of patient-reported outcome measures.},

Results showed that psychosocial factors were associated with occupational accidents in both sectors. For the construction industry, high time pressure and exposure to violence and harassment by colleagues or supervisors were associated with occupational accidents. For the health and welfare sector, low autonomy and exposure to violence and harassment by colleagues or supervisors or by people outside the organization were associated with occupational accidents. The present paper stresses the importance of also taking psychological consequences and psychosocial factors at work into account in assessing the occurrence of occupational accidents.},

Here we investigated how symptoms in OPMD initiate only at midlife and why a subset of skeletal muscles is predominantly affected. Genome-wide RNA expression profiles from Vastus lateralis muscles human carriers of expanded-PABPN1 at pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages were compared with healthy controls. Major expression changes were found to be associated with age rather than with expression of expanded-PABPN1, instead transcriptomes of OPMD and elderly muscles were significantly similar (P<0.05). Using k-means clustering we identified age-dependent trends in both OPMD and controls, but trends were often accelerated in OPMD. We report an age-regulated decline in PABPN1 levels in Vastus lateralis muscles from the fifth decade. In concurrence with severe muscle degeneration in OPMD, the decline in PABPN1 accelerated in OPMD and was specific to skeletal muscles. Reduced PABPN1 levels (30% to 60%) in muscle cells induced myogenic defects and morphological signatures of cellular aging in proportion to PABPN1 expression levels. We suggest that PABPN1 levels regulate muscle cell aging and OPMD represents an accelerated muscle aging disorder.},

Here we report the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina 450K array on whole blood samples of 68 Ghanaians. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were assessed for plasma renin concentration, aldosterone, and ARR using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and technical covariates. Additionally, we extracted methylation loci previously associated with hypertension, kidney function, or that were annotated to RAAS-related genes and associated these with renin and aldosterone concentration. We identified one DMP for renin, ten DMPs for aldosterone, and one DMP associated with ARR. Top DMPs were annotated to the PTPRN2, SKIL, and KCNT1 genes, which have been reported in relation to cardiometabolic risk factors, atherosclerosis, and sodium-potassium handling. Moreover, EWAS loci previously associated with hypertension, kidney function, or RAAS-related genes were also associated with renin, aldosterone, and ARR. In this first EWAS on RAAS hormones, we identified DMPs associated with renin, aldosterone, and ARR in a SSA population. These findings are a first step in understanding the role of DNA methylation in regulation of the RAAS in general and in a SSA population specifically. Replication and translational studies are needed to establish the role of these DMPs in the hypertension burden in SSA populations.},

Patients receiving daycare, terminally ill patients and children were excluded. All direct healthcare costs from day of admission until 1 month after discharge. Health outcome concerned quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which was measured with the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). We found no significant difference for QALY gain (+0.02, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.05) when comparing the PA/MD model with the MD model. Total costs per patient did not significantly differ between the groups (+€568, 95% CI -€254 to €1391, p=0.175). Regarding the costs per item, a difference of €309 per patient (95% CI €29 to €588, p=0.030) was found in favour of the MD model regarding length of stay. Personnel costs per patient for the provider who is primarily responsible for medical care on the ward were lower on the wards in the PA/MD model (-€11, 95% CI -€16 to -€6, p<0.01). This study suggests that the cost-effectiveness on wards managed by PAs, in collaboration with MDs, is similar to the care on wards with traditional house staffing. The involvement of PAs may reduce personnel costs, but not overall healthcare costs. NCT01835444.},

Epigenetic and genetic profiles were based on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. We searched for differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). For genetic associations we analyzed the CpG-SNPs present on the array. We detected no genome-wide significant DMPs and we did not replicate previously reported DMPs associated with PTSD. However, GSE analysis of the top 100 DMPs showed enrichment of three genes involved in the dopaminergic neurogenesis pathway. Furthermore, we observed a suggestive association of one relatively large DMR between patients and controls, which was located at the PAX8 gene and previously associated with other psychiatric disorders. Finally, we validated five PTSD-associated CpG-SNPs identified with the array using sanger sequencing. We subsequently replicated the association of one common SNP (rs1990322) in the CACNA1C locus with PTSD in an independent cohort of traumatized children. The CACNA1C locus was previously associated with other psychiatric disorders, but not yet with PTSD. Thus, despite the small sample size, inclusion of extreme symptom severity phenotypes in a highly homogenous traumatized cohort enabled detection of epigenetic and genetic loci associated with PTSD. Moreover, here we showed that genetically confounded 450K probes are informative for genetic association analysis.},

However, the role of biological aging in this emerging burden of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) among migrant and non-migrant Africans is unknown. We aimed to examine differences in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) as measured by four clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge and GrimAge) and their associations with cardiometabolic factors among migrant Ghanaians in Europe and non-migrant Ghanaians. Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data of 712 Ghanaians from cross-sectional RODAM study were used to quantify EAA. We assessed correlation of DNAmAge measures with chronological age, and then performed linear regressions to determine associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood pressure, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and one-carbon metabolism nutrients with EAA among migrant and non-migrants. We replicated our findings among 172 rural-urban sibling pairs from India migration study and among 120 native South Africans from PURE-SA-NW study. We found that Ghanaian migrants have lower EAA than non-migrants. Within migrants, higher FBG was positively associated with EAA measures. Within non-migrants, higher BMI, and Vitamin B9 (folate) intake were negatively associated with EAA measures. Our findings on FBG, BMI and folate were replicated in the independent cohorts. Our study shows that migration is negatively associated with EAA among Ghanaians. Moreover, cardiometabolic factors are differentially associated with EAA within migrant and non-migrant subgroups. Our results call for context-based interventions for CMD among transitioning populations that account for effects of biological aging. European Commission.},

CGM metrics (descriptive, glycemic variation and glycemic control parameters) were calculated for 47 liver GSD and 14 IKH patients, categorized in cohorts by disease subtype, age and treatment status, and compared to published age-matched CGM metrics from healthy individuals. Glycemic control was assessed as time-in-range (TIR; ≥3.9 - ≤7.8 and ≥3.9 - ≤10.0 mmol/L), time-below-range (TBR; <3.0 mmol/L and ≥3.0 - ≤3.9 mmol/L), and time-above-range (TAR; >7.8 and >10.0 mmol/L). Despite all patients receiving dietary treatment, GSD cohorts displayed significantly different CGM metrics compared to healthy individuals. Decreased TIR together with increased TAR were noted in GSD I, GSD III, and GSD XI (Fanconi-Bickel syndrome) cohorts (all p < 0.05). In addition, all GSD I cohorts showed increased TBR (all p < 0.05). In GSD IV an increased TBR (p < 0.05) and decreased TAR were noted (p < 0.05). In GSD IX only increased TAR was observed (p < 0.05). IKH patient cohorts, both with and without treatment, presented CGM metrics similar to healthy individuals. Despite dietary treatment, most liver GSD cohorts do not achieve CGM metrics comparable to healthy individuals. International recommendations on the use of CGM and clinical targets for CGM metrics in liver GSD patients are warranted, both for patient care and clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Up to 30% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) develop from sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). Within the serrated neoplasia pathway, at least two principally distinct oncogenetic routes exist generating microsatellite-stable and microsatellite-instable CRCs, respectively. Aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) is found early in the serrated pathway and might play a role in both oncogenetic routes. We studied a cohort of 23 SSLs with a small focus (<10 mm) of dysplasia or cancer, 10 of which were MLH1 deficient and 13 MLH1 proficient. By comparing, for each SSL, the methylation status of (1) the region of dysplasia or cancer (SSL-D), (2) the nondysplastic SSL (SSL), and (3) adjacent normal mucosa, differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) were assessed both genome-wide as well as in a tumor-suppressor gene-focused approach. By comparing DNAm of MLH1-deficient SSL-Ds with their corresponding SSLs, we identified five DMRs, including those annotating for PRDM2 and, not unexpectedly, MLH1. PRDM2 gene promotor methylation was associated with MLH1 expression status, as it was largely hypermethylated in MLH1-deficient SSL-Ds and hypomethylated in MLH1-proficient SSL-Ds. Significantly increased DNAm levels of PRDM2 and MLH1, in particular at 'critical' MLH1 probe sites, were to some extent already visible in SSLs as compared to normal mucosa (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, p < 0.0001, respectively). No DMRs, nor DMPs, were identified for SSLs destined to evolve into MLH1-proficient SSL-Ds. Our data indicate that, within both arms of the serrated CRC pathway, the majority of the epigenetic alterations are introduced early during SSL formation. Promoter hypermethylation of PRDM2 and MLH1 on the other hand specifically initiates in SSLs destined to transform into MLH1-deficient CRCs suggesting that the fate of SSLs may not necessarily result from a stochastic process but possibly is already imprinted and predisposed.},

The majority of these findings showed directionally consistent associations with the respective clinical outcomes chronic kidney disease and moderately increased albuminuria. Associations of DNA methylation with kidney function, such as CpGs at JAZF1, PELI1 and CHD2 were validated in kidney tissue. Methylation at PHRF1, LDB2, CSRNP1 and IRF5 indicated causal effects on kidney function. Enrichment analyses revealed pathways related to hemostasis and blood cell migration for estimated glomerular filtration rate, and immune cell activation and response for urinary albumin-to-creatinineratio-associated CpGs.},

Autosomal-dominant OPMD is caused by a short (GCG)(8-13) expansions within the first exon of the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 gene (PABPN1), leading to an expanded polyalanine tract in the mutated protein. Expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble aggregates in the nuclei of skeletal muscle fibres. In order to gain insight into the different physiological processes affected in OPMD muscles, we have used a transgenic mouse model of OPMD (A17.1) and performed transcriptomic studies combined with a detailed phenotypic characterization of this model at three time points. The transcriptomic analysis revealed a massive gene deregulation in the A17.1 mice, among which we identified a significant deregulation of pathways associated with muscle atrophy. Using a mathematical model for progression, we have identified that one-third of the progressive genes were also associated with muscle atrophy. Functional and histological analysis of the skeletal muscle of this mouse model confirmed a severe and progressive muscular atrophy associated with a reduction in muscle strength. Moreover, muscle atrophy in the A17.1 mice was restricted to fast glycolytic fibres, containing a large number of intranuclear inclusions (INIs). The soleus muscle and, in particular, oxidative fibres were spared, even though they contained INIs albeit to a lesser degree. These results demonstrate a fibre-type specificity of muscle atrophy in this OPMD model. This study improves our understanding of the biological pathways modified in OPMD to identify potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.},

We performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify loci associated with serum C-reactive protein (marker of inflammation) among Ghanaians and further assessed whether differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were linked to CVD in previous reports, or to estimated CVD risk in the same population. We used the Illumina Infinium® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to obtain DNAm profiles of blood samples in 589 Ghanaians from the RODAM study (without acute infections, not taking anti-inflammatory medications, CRP levels < 40 mg/L). We then used linear models to identify DMPs associated with CRP concentrations. Post-hoc, we evaluated associations of identified DMPs with elevated CVD risk estimated via ASCVD risk score. We also performed subset analyses at CRP levels ≤10 mg/L and replication analyses on candidate probes. Finally, we assessed for biological relevance of our findings in public databases. We subsequently identified 14 novel DMPs associated with CRP. In post-hoc evaluations, we found that DMPs in PC, BTG4 and PADI1 showed trends of associations with estimated CVD risk, we identified a separate DMP in MORC2 that was associated with CRP levels ≤10 mg/L, and we successfully replicated 65 (24%) of previously reported DMPs. All DMPs with gene annotations (13) were biologically linked to inflammation or CVD traits. We have identified epigenetic loci that may play a role in the intersection between inflammation and CVD among Ghanaians. Further studies among other Africans are needed to confirm our findings.},

However, there is, as yet, no structured protocol available for the identification and application of an intervention for stress-related mental health problems at the workplace. This paper describes the structured development, implementation and planning for the evaluation of a return-to-work intervention for sick-listed employees with stress-related mental disorders (SMDs). The intervention is based on an existing successful return-to-work intervention for sick-listed employees with low back pain. The principles of Intervention Mapping were applied to combine theory and evidence in the development, implementation and planning for the evaluation of a participatory workplace intervention, aimed at an early return-to-work for sick-listed employees with SMDs. All stakeholders were involved in focus group interviews: i.e. employees recently sick-listed with SMDs, supervisors and occupational health professionals. The development of the participatory workplace intervention according to the Intervention Mapping principles resulted in a structured return-to-work intervention, specifically tailored to the needs of sick-listed employees with SMDs. Return-to-work was proposed as a behavioural change, and the Attitude - Social influence - self-Efficacy model was identified as a theoretical framework. Stakeholder involvement in focus group interviews served to enhance the implementation. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Intervention Mapping was found to be a promising method to develop interventions tailored to a specific target group in the field of occupational health.},

Under empagliflozin, all GSDIb individuals reported improved quality-of-life-scores. Neutrophil dysfunction related symptoms allowed either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor cessation or tapering. Calculated cost savings per patient per year ranged between € 6482-14 190 (NL) and € 1281-41 231 (AT). The budget impact analysis estimated annual total cost savings ranging between € 75 062-225 716 (NL) and € 37 697-231 790 (AT), based on conservative assumptions. The systematic benefit-risk assessment was favorable. From a VBHC perspective, empagliflozin treatment in GSDIb improved personal and clinical outcomes while saving costs, thereby creating value at multiple pillars. We emphasize the importance to reimburse empagliflozin for GSDIb individuals, further supported by the favorable systematic benefit-risk assessment. These observations in similar directions in two countries/health care systems strongly suggest that our findings can be extrapolated to other geographical areas and health care systems.},

The molecular confirmation of this syndrome is possible in approximately 85% of the cases, whereas in the remaining 15% of the cases, the underlying defect remains unclear. The goal of our research was to identify new epigenetic loci related to BWS. We studied a group of 25 patients clinically diagnosed with BWS but without molecular conformation after DNA diagnostics and performed a whole genome methylation analysis using the HumanMethylation450 Array (Illumina).We found hypermethylation throughout the methylome in two BWS patients. The hypermethylated sites in these patients overlapped and included both non-imprinted and imprinted regions. This finding was not previously described in any BWS-diagnosed patient.Furthermore, one BWS patient exhibited aberrant methylation in four maternally methylated regions-IGF1R, NHP2L1, L3MBTL, and ZDBF2-that overlapped with the differentially methylated regions found in BWS patients with multi-locus imprinting disturbance (MLID). This finding suggests that the BWS phenotype can result from MLID without detectable methylation defects in the primarily disease-associated loci (11p15). Another patient manifested small but significant aberrant methylation in disease-associated loci at 11p near H19, possibly confirming the diagnosis in this patient.},

We studied children from the Dutch EuroPrevall birth cohort study (N = 20 CMA, N = 23 controls, N = 10 tolerant boys), age and gender matched. CMA was challenge proven. Bisulfite converted DNA (blood) was analyzed using the 450K infinium DNA-methylation array. Four groups (combined, girls, boys and tolerant boys) were analysed between CMA and controls. Statistical analysis and pathway-analysis were performed in "R" using IMA, Minfi and the global-test package. Differentially methylated regions in DHX58, ZNF281, EIF42A and HTRA2 genes were validated by quantitative amplicon sequencing (ROCHE 454(®)). General hypermethylation was found in the CMA group compared to control children, while this effect was absent in the tolerant group. Methylation differences were, among others, found in regions of DHX58, ZNF281, EIF42A and HTRA2 genes. Several of these genes are known to be involved in immunological pathways and associated with other allergies. We show that epigenetic associations are involved in CMA. Although, the statistical power of our study is limited and our sample was based on whole blood, we were still able to detect feasible loci and pathways. Therefore our findings might contribute to future diagnostic or therapeutic interventions for specific CMA. Further studies have to confirm the findings of our study.},

  abstract = {Elevated serum urate levels, a complex trait and major risk factor for incident gout, are correlated with cardiometabolic traits via incompletely understood mechanisms. DNA methylation in whole blood captures genetic and environmental influences and is assessed in transethnic meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of serum urate (discovery, n = 12,474, replication, n = 5522). The 100 replicated, epigenome-wide significant (p < 1.1E-7) CpGs explain 11.6% of the serum urate variance. At SLC2A9, the serum urate locus with the largest effect in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), five CpGs are associated with SLC2A9 gene expression. Four CpGs at SLC2A9 have significant causal effects on serum urate levels and/or gout, and two of these partly mediate the effects of urate-associated GWAS variants. In other genes, including SLC7A11 and PHGDH, 17 urate-associated CpGs are associated with conditions defining metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these CpGs may represent a blood DNA methylation signature of cardiometabolic risk factors. This study demonstrates that EWAS can provide new insights into GWAS loci and the correlation of serum urate with other complex traits.},

  abstract = {The choice for a polyadenylation site determines the length of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTRs) of an mRNA. Inclusion or exclusion of regulatory sequences in the 3'-UTR may ultimately affect gene expression levels. Poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) is involved in polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs. An alanine repeat expansion in PABPN1 (exp-PABPN1) causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). We hypothesized that previously observed disturbed gene expression patterns in OPMD muscles may have been the result of an effect of PABPN1 on alternative polyadenylation, influencing mRNA stability, localization and translation. A single molecule polyadenylation site sequencing method was developed to explore polyadenylation site usage on a genome-wide level in mice overexpressing exp-PABPN1. We identified 2012 transcripts with altered polyadenylation site usage. In the far majority, more proximal alternative polyadenylation sites were used, resulting in shorter 3'-UTRs. 3'-UTR shortening was generally associated with increased expression. Similar changes in polyadenylation site usage were observed after knockdown or overexpression of expanded but not wild-type PABPN1 in cultured myogenic cells. Our data indicate that PABPN1 is important for polyadenylation site selection and that reduced availability of functional PABPN1 in OPMD muscles results in use of alternative polyadenylation sites, leading to large-scale deregulation of gene expression.},

Several epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have found DNA methylation loci associated with T2D in European populations. However, data from African populations are lacking. We undertook the first EWAS for T2D among sub-Saharan Africans, aiming at identifying ubiquitous and novel DNA methylation loci associated with T2D. The Illumina 450k DNA-methylation array was used on whole blood samples of 713 Ghanaian participants (256 with T2D, 457 controls) from the cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for T2D and HbA1c were identified through linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, estimated cell counts, hybridization batch, array position and body mass index (BMI). We also did a candidate analysis of previously reported EWAS loci for T2D in non-African populations, identified through a systematic literature search. Four DMPs [cg19693031 (TXNIP), cg04816311 (C7orf50), cg00574958 (CPT1A), cg07988171 (TPM4)] were associated with T2D after correction for inflation by possible systematic biases. The most strongly associated DMP-cg19693031, TXNIP (P = 2.6E-19) -showed hypomethylation in T2D cases compared with controls. Two out of the four DMPs [cg19693031 (TXNIP), cg04816311 (C7orf50)] remained associated with T2D after adjustment for BMI, and one locus [cg07988171 (TPM4)] that has not been reported previously. In this first EWAS for T2D in sub-Saharan Africans, we have identified four DMPs at epigenome-wide level, one of which is novel. These findings provide insight into the epigenetic loci that underlie the burden of T2D in sub-Saharan Africans.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts on marine systems are increasing in frequency, geographic range and severity. While changes in climate will likely lead to the greatest impacts at the system-level, for marine megafauna, entanglement in marine debris also constitutes a pernicious threat. For baleen whales, in regions where high productivity and prolific fisheries overlap, entanglement is emerging as a component of their life history: In some of these regions, entanglement comprises the leading cause of serious injury and mortality. Additionally, up to 80% of whales carry scars indicative of entanglement, and associated declines in long-term health are reducing fecundity. Here, we describe behavioral traits seen in humpback whales during entanglement incidents. Specifically, we focus on reports of humpback whales that have remained in association with entangled whales during these incidents and apply the term "companion whales" in reference to these whales. Reports reviewed include a detailed account of a recent incident observed in Hawaiian waters, a compilation of 62 accounts of similar behavior extracted from 414 reports of entanglement events provided by regional entanglement response networks, and a series of six reports associated with whaling activities. The similarities between the current behavior of companion whales and behaviors observed during whaling activities suggest that this may be an example of behavioral plasticity, underscoring the expanding behavioral repertoire exhibited by baleen whales, and highlighting their potential resilience as they respond to the changing marine environment.},

  abstract = {The Au'au Channel between the islands of Maui and Lanai, Hawaii comprises critical breeding habitat for humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) of the Central North Pacific stock. However, like many regions where marine mega-fauna gather, these waters are also the focus of a flourishing local eco-tourism and whale watching industry. Our aim was to establish current trends in habitat preference in female-calf humpback whale pairs within this region, focusing specifically on the busy, eastern portions of the channel. We used an equally-spaced zigzag transect survey design, compiled our results in a GIS model to identify spatial trends and calculated Neu's Indices to quantify levels of habitat use. Our study revealed that while mysticete female-calf pairs on breeding grounds typically favor shallow, inshore waters, female-calf pairs in the Au'au Channel avoided shallow waters (<20 m) and regions within 2 km of the shoreline. Preferred regions for female-calf pairs comprised water depths between 40-60 m, regions of rugged bottom topography and regions that lay between 4 and 6 km from a small boat harbor (Lahaina Harbor) that fell within the study area. In contrast to other humpback whale breeding grounds, there was only minimal evidence of typical patterns of stratification or segregation according to group composition. A review of habitat use by maternal females across Hawaiian waters indicates that maternal habitat choice varies between localities within the Hawaiian Islands, suggesting that maternal females alter their use of habitat according to locally varying pressures. This ability to respond to varying environments may be the key that allows wildlife species to persist in regions where human activity and critical habitat overlap.},

X-linked and autosomal forms are sometimes clinically indistinguishable. For genetic counseling in families, it is therefore important to know the gene involved. In 24 of 42 unrelated patients with features of HED, we found a mutation in ED1. ED1-negative patients were screened for mutations in EDAR and EDARADD. We found mutations in EDAR in 5 of these 18 patients. One mutation, p.Glu354X, is novel. In EDARADD, a novel variant p.Ser93Phe, probably a neutral polymorphism, was also found. Clinically, there was a difference between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive HED patients. The phenotype in patients with mutations in both EDAR alleles was comparable to males with X-linked HED. Patients with autosomal dominant HED had features comparable to those of female carriers of X-linked HED. The teeth of these patients were quite severely affected. Hypohidrosis and sparse hair were also evident, but less severe. This study confirms Chassaing et al's earlier finding that mutations in EDAR account for approximately 25% of non-ED1-related HED. Mutations leading to a premature stop codon have a recessive effect except when the stop codon is in the last exon. Heterozygous missense mutations in the functional domains of the gene may have a dominant-negative effect with much variation in expression. Patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the EDAR gene have a more severe phenotype than those with a heterozygous missense, nonsense or frame-shift mutation.},

It is not clear, whether infants with CMA have an increased risk of developing other allergic diseases later in life, the so-called "allergic march". We aimed to detect genetic associations of CMA using reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in other allergic diseases and genetic mutations within the filaggrin (FLG) gene. Both to investigate possible causes of CMA, which also suggests an "allergic march". Thirty children from the Dutch EuroPrevall birth cohort study with CMA in infancy and twenty-three healthy controls were studied. Six candidate SNPs were selected (minor allele frequency 10-50 % combined with a large effect) based on the literature. Thirteen FLG candidate mutations were selected spread over repeats 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 respectively. We found two SNP's, rs17616434 (P = 0.002) and rs2069772 (P = 0.038), significantly associated with CMA. One is located near the toll like receptor 6 (TLR6) gene, which functionally interacts with toll-like receptor 2, and is associated with an increased risk of other allergic diseases. One is located at the Interleukin 2 (IL2) locus. Twelve FLG amplicons were analyzed, but showed no significant enrichment. Nevertheless, we did observe more FLG mutations in the CMA-group compared to controls. We significantly associated two SNPs with CMA, suggesting that variation in the TLR6 and IL2 genes contribute to the expression of CMA. In addition, since TLR6 and IL2 were earlier associated with other later onset allergies, this also favours the "allergic march" hypothesis. We observed more FLG mutations in the CMA-group, albeit we found no statistical significant enrichment of FLG mutations. Further studies are necessary to investigate the role of common variants and FLG or other skin barrier gene mutations in CMA.},

The parameters affecting enantioselectivity (column efficiency, influence of modifiers and basic or acidic additives, and temperature) have been studied. Enantiomerization of 3-OH-benzodiazepines could be suppressed by working at low temperatures or by using acetonitrile as a comodifier. Serial coupling of different chiral stationary phase columns resulted in a column triplet (Chiralpak AD, an amylose derivative; Chiralcel OD, a cellulose derivative; and Chirex 3022, a Brush-type with pi-donor characteristics) on which all solutes investigated could be baseline separated.},

Sixty CPR sessions (140s each, 30:2, C:R ratio 1:1) were performed using a manikin on standard hospital mattresses, with or without a backboard in combination with variable weights. Sternum-to-spine compression distance was controlled (range 30-60mm) allowing evaluation of the underlying compliant surface on total hand travel. Movement of the caregiver's hands was significantly larger (up to 111mm at 50mm compression depth, p<0.0001) when sternum-to-spine compressions were performed without a backboard than with one. The extent of this variable extra travel effect depended on the type of mattress as well as the force of compression. Foam mattresses and air chamber systems act as springs and follow hand movement, while 'slow foam' mattresses incorporate time delays, making depth and force sensing harder. A backboard decreases the extra hand movement due to mattress effects by more than 50%, strongly reducing caregiver work. Total vertical hand movement is significantly, and clinically relevantly much, larger than sternum-to-spine compression depth when CPR is performed on a mattress. Additional movement depends on the type of mattress and can be strongly reduced, but not eliminated, when a backboard is applied. The additional motion and increased work load adds extra complexity to in-hospital CPR. We propose that this should be taken into account during training by in-hospital caregivers.},

We hypothesized that skin temperature in a specific limb could be disrupted by psychologically disrupting the sense of ownership of that limb. In six separate experiments, and by using an established protocol to induce the rubber hand illusion, we demonstrate that skin temperature of the real hand decreases when we take ownership of an artificial counterpart. The decrease in skin temperature is limb-specific: it does not occur in the unstimulated hand, nor in the ipsilateral foot. The effect is not evoked by tactile or visual input per se, nor by simultaneous tactile and visual input per se, nor by a shift in attention toward the experimental side or limb. In fact, taking ownership of an artificial hand slows tactile processing of information from the real hand, which is also observed in patients who demonstrate body disownership after stroke. These findings of psychologically induced limb-specific disruption of temperature regulation provide the first evidence that: taking ownership of an artificial body part has consequences for the real body part; that the awareness of our physical self and the physiological regulation of self are closely linked in a top-down manner; and that cognitive processes that disrupt the sense of body ownership may in turn disrupt temperature regulation in numerous states characterized by both.},

  abstract = {A series of modifiable lifestyle factors, such as diet quality, physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking, may drive the rising burden of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among sub-Saharan Africans globally. It is unclear whether epigenetic changes play a mediatory role in the associations between these lifestyle factors and T2DM. We assessed the associations between a comprehensive lifestyle index, DNA methylation and T2DM among Ghanaian adults. We used whole-blood Illumina 450 k DNA methylation data from 713 Ghanaians from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. We constructed a comprehensive lifestyle index based on established cut-offs for diet quality, physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking status. In the T2DM-free discovery cohort (n = 457), linear models were fitted to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with the lifestyle index after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and technical covariates. Associations between the identified DMPs and the primary outcome (T2DM), as well as secondary outcomes (fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c), were determined via logistic and linear regression models, respectively. In the present study population (mean age: 52 ± 10 years; male: 42.6%), the comprehensive lifestyle index showed a significant association with one DMP annotated to an intergenic region on chromosome 7 (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.024). Others were annotated to ADCY7, SMARCE1, AHRR, LOXL2, and PTBP1 genes. One DMR was identified and annotated to the GFPT2 gene (familywise error rate (FWER) from bumphunter bootstrap = 0.036). None of the DMPs showed significant associations with T2DM; directions of effect were positive for the DMP in the AHRR and inverse for all the other DMPs. Higher methylation of the ADCY7 DMP was associated with higher FBG (p = 0.024); LOXL2 DMP was associated with lower FBG (p = 0.023) and HbA1c (p = 0.049); and PTBP1 DMP was associated with lower HbA1c (p = 0.002). In this explorative epigenome-wide association study among Ghanaians, we identified one DMP and DMR associated with a comprehensive lifestyle index not previously associated with individual lifestyle factors. Based on our findings, we infer that lifestyle factors in combination, affect DNA methylation, thereby influencing the risk of T2DM among Ghanaian adults living in different contexts.},

  abstract = {Closure of the ductus arteriosus (DA) at birth is essential for the transition from fetal to postnatal life. Before birth the DA bypasses the uninflated lungs by shunting blood from the pulmonary trunk into the systemic circulation. The molecular mechanism underlying DA closure and degeneration has not been fully elucidated, but is associated with apoptosis and cytolytic necrosis in the inner media and intima. We detected features of histology during DA degeneration that are comparable to Hutchinson Gilford Progeria syndrome and ageing. Immunohistochemistry on human fetal and neonatal DA, and aorta showed that lamin A/C was expressed in all layers of the vessel wall. As a novel finding we report that progerin, a splicing variant of lamin A/C was expressed almost selectively in the normal closing neonatal DA, from which we hypothesized that progerin is involved in DA closure. Progerin was detected in 16.2%±7.2 cells of the DA. Progerin-expressing cells were predominantly located in intima and inner media where cytolytic necrosis accompanied by apoptosis will develop. Concomitantly we found loss of α-smooth muscle actin as well as reduced lamin A/C expression compared to the fetal and non-closing DA. In cells of the adjacent aorta, that remains patent, progerin expression was only sporadically detected in 2.5%±1.5 of the cells. Data were substantiated by the detection of mRNA of progerin in the neonatal DA but not in the aorta, by PCR and sequencing analysis. The fetal DA and the non-closing persistent DA did not present with progerin expressing cells. Our analysis revealed that the spatiotemporal expression of lamin A/C and progerin in the neonatal DA was mutually exclusive. We suggest that activation of LMNA alternative splicing is involved in vascular remodeling in the circulatory system during normal neonatal DA closure.},

The effect of such a stressor on health could potentially be mediated via epigenetics. In this study we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to assess the association between levels of PD with genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in SSA migrants. The Illumina 450 K DNA-methylation array was used on whole blood samples of 340 Ghanaian adults residing in three European cities from the cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. PD was assessed using sum scores of the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS). Differentially methylated positions and regions (DMPs and DMRs) were identified through linear regression analysis. Two hypo-methylated DMPs, namely cg13986138 (CYFIP1) and cg10316525(ANKRD63), were found to be associated with PD. DMR analysis identified 47 regions associated with the PD. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first EWAS for PD in first generation SSA migrants. We identified two DMPs associated with PD. Whether these associations underlie a consequence or causal effect within the scope of biological functionality needs additional research.},

We aimed to assess whether altered DNA methylation might be associated with FH in this latter group. In this study we included 78 FH mutation-negative patients and 58 FH mutation-positive patients with a pathogenic LDLR variant. All patients were male, not using lipid lowering therapies and had LDL-C levels >6 mmol/L and triglyceride levels <3.5 mmol/L. DNA methylation was measured with the Infinium Methylation EPIC 850 K beadchip assay. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to explore DNA methylation differences between the two groups in genes related to lipid metabolism. A gradient boosting machine learning model was applied to investigate accumulated genome-wide differences between the two groups. Candidate gene analysis revealed one significantly hypomethylated CpG site in CPT1A (cg00574958) in FH mutation-negative patients, while no differences in methylation in other lipid genes were observed. The machine learning model did distinguish the two groups with a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC)±SD of 0.80±0.17 and provided two CpG sites (cg26426080 and cg11478607) in genes with a possible link to lipid metabolism (PRDM16 and GSTT1). FH mutation-negative patients are characterized by accumulated genome wide DNA methylation differences, but not by major DNA methylation alterations in known lipid genes compared to FH mutation-positive patients.

We investigated the potential of photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect the presence of a spontaneous pulse during automated CPR in an animal study. Twelve anesthetized pigs were instrumented to monitor circulatory and respiratory parameters. Here we present the simultaneously recorded PPG and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, followed by 20 min of automated CPR and subsequent defibrillation. After defibrillation, pediatric-guidelines-style life support was given in cycles of 2 min. PPG and ABP waveforms were recorded during all stages of the protocol. Raw PPG waveforms were acquired with a custom-built photoplethysmograph controlling a commercial reflectance pulse oximetry probe attached to the nose. ABP was measured in the aorta. In nine animals ROSC was achieved. Throughout the protocol, PPG and ABP frequency content showed strong resemblance. We demonstrate that (1) the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse during ventilation pauses, and that (2) frequency analysis of the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse and the determination of the pulse rate, even during ongoing chest compressions, if the pulse and compression rates are sufficiently distinct. These results demonstrate the potential of PPG as a non-invasive means to detect pulse presence or absence, as well as pulse rate during CPR.},

  abstract = {Muscle fibrosis characterizes degenerated muscles in muscular dystrophies and in late onset myopathies. Fibrotic muscles often exhibit thickening of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The molecular regulation of this process is not fully understood. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), an expansion of an alanine tract at the N-terminus of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) causes muscle symptoms. OPMD patient muscle degeneration initiates after midlife, while at an earlier age carriers of alanine expansion mutant PABPN1 (expPABPN1) are clinically pre-symptomatic. OPMD is characterized by fibrosis in skeletal muscles but the causative molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We studied the molecular processes that are involved in OPMD pathology using cross-species mRNA expression profiles in muscles from patients and model systems. We identified significant dysregulation of the ECM functional group, among which the procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 1 gene (PCOLCE) was consistently down-regulated across species. We investigated PCOLCE subcellular localization in OPMD muscle samples and OPMD model systems to investigate any functional relevance of PCOLCE down-regulation in this disease. We found that muscle degeneration in OPMD is associated with PCOLCE down-regulation. In addition to its known presence at the ECM, we also found PCOLCE within the nucleus of muscle cells. PCOLCE sub-cellular localization changes during myoblast cell fusion and is disrupted in cells expressing mutant expPABPN1. Our results show that PCOLCE binds to soluble PABPN1 and co-localizes with aggregated PABPN1 with a preference for the mutant protein. In muscle biopsies from OPMD patients we find that extracellular PCOLCE is depleted with its concomitant enrichment within the nuclear compartment. PCOLCE regulates collagen processing at the ECM. Depletion of extracellular PCOLCE is associated with the expression of expPABPN1 in OPMD patient muscles. PCOLCE is also localized within the nucleus where it binds to PABPN1, suggesting that PCOLCE shuttles between the ECM and the nucleus. PCOLCE preferentially binds to expPABPN1. Nuclear-localized PCOLCE is enriched in muscle cells expressing expPABPN1. We suggest that nuclear entrapment of PCOLCE and its extracellular depletion represents a novel molecular mechanism in late-onset muscle fibrosis.},

Such factors may partially affect these traits through epigenetic programing.

DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most commonly studied epigenetic feature. In this study we conducted an epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis on height-related traits in a Sub-Saharan African population, in order to detect DNAm biomarkers across four height-related traits. DNAm profiles were acquired in whole blood samples of 704 Ghanaians, sourced from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants study, using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear models were fitted to detect differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) associated with height, leg-to-height ratio (LHR), leg length, and sitting height. No epigenome-wide significant DMPs were recorded. However we did observe among our top DMPs five informative probes associated with the height-related traits: cg26905768 (leg length), cg13268132 (leg length), cg19776793 (height), cg23072383 (LHR), and cg24625894 (sitting height).

Blood flow is rarely measured systematically with high fidelity. Using a programmable mechanical chest compression device, we studied the effect of inter-compression pauses in a swine model of cardiac arrest, testing the hypothesis that a single 'optimal' CC waveform exists based on measurements of resulting blood flow. Hemodynamics were studied in 9 domestic swine (∼30 kg) using multiple flow probes and standard physiological monitoring. After 10 min of ventricular fibrillation, five mechanical chest compression waveforms (5.1 cm, varying inter-compression pauses) were delivered for 2 min each in a semi-random pattern, totaling 50 compression minutes. Linear Mixed Models were used to estimate the effect of compression waveform on hemodynamics. Blood flow and pressure decayed significantly with time in both arteries and veins. No waveform maximized blood flow in all vessels simultaneously and the waveform generating maximal blood flow in a specific vessel changed over time in all vessels. A flow mismatch between paired arteries and veins, e.g. abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, also developed over time. The waveform with the slowest rate and shortest duty cycle had the smallest mismatch between flows after about 30 min of CPR. This data challenges the concept of a single optimal CC waveform. Time dependent physiological response to compressions and no single compression waveform optimizing flow in all vessels indicate that current descriptions of CPR don't reflect patient physiology.},

To model OPMD in a myogenic and physiological context, we generated mouse myoblast cell clones stably expressing either human wild type (WT) or expPABPN1 at low levels. Transgene expression is induced on myotube differentiation and results in formation of insoluble nuclear PABPN1 aggregates that are similar to those observed in patients with OPMD. Quantitative analysis of PABPN1 in myotube cultures revealed that expPABPN1 accumulation and aggregation is greater than that of the WT protein. We found that aggregation of expPABPN1 is more affected than WT PABPN1 by inhibition of proteasome activity. Consistent with this, in myotube cultures expressing expPABPN1, deregulation of the proteasome was identified as the most significantly perturbed pathway. Differences in the accumulation of soluble WT and expPABPN1 were consistent with differences in ubiquitination and rate of protein turnover. This study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, that, in myotubes, the ratio of soluble/insoluble expPABPN1 is significantly lower compared with that of the WT protein. We suggest that this difference can contribute to muscle weakness in OPMD.},

We found significant methylome-wide associations for pediatric PTSD (false discovery rate p < .05) compared with non-PTSD control groups (traumatized and nontraumatized youths). Methylation differences on nine genes were replicated, including genes related to glucocorticoid functioning. In both cohorts, methylation on OLFM3 gene was further associated with anterior hippocampal volume. These findings point to molecular pathways involved in inflammation, stress response, and neuroplasticity as potential contributors to neural abnormalities and provide potentially unique biomarkers and treatment targets for pediatric PTSD.},

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAm) have previously been linked to PTSD pathogenesis, additionally DNAm may affect response to (psychological) therapies. Besides investigating the direct link between DNAm and treatment response, it might be helpful to investigate the link between DNAm and previously associated biological mechanisms with treatment outcome. Thereby gaining a deeper molecular understanding of how psychotherapy (reflecting a change in the environment) relates to epigenetic changes and the adaptability of individuals. To date, limited research is done in clinical samples and no studies have been conducted in youth. Therefore we conducted a study in a Dutch cohort of youth with and without PTSD (n = 87, age 8-18 years). We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of saliva-based genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) levels, and salivary cortisol secretion. The last might reflect possible abbreviations on the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA-axis is previously linked to DNAm and the development and recovery of PTSD. Youth were treated with 8 sessions of either Eye Movement Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR) or Trauma Focused Cognitive behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). Our epigenome wide approach showed distinct methylation between treatment responders and non-responders on C18orf63 gene post-treatment. This genomic region is related to the PAX5 gene, involved in neurodevelopment and inflammation response. Additionally, our targeted approach indicated that there were longitudinal DNAm changes in successfully treated youth at the CRHR2 gene. Methylation at this gene was further correlated with cortisol secretion pre- and post-treatment. Awaiting replication, findings of this first study in youth point to molecular pathways involved in stress response and neuroplasticity to be associated with treatment response.},

Prospective CGM data were collected during the ENGLUPRO GSDIa trial (NCT04311307) in which a Dexcom G6 device was used. Ten adult patients with GSDIa and 10 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled.

Descriptive [eg, glycemic variability (GV), time below range, time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR)] and advanced (ie, first- and second-order derivatives, Fourier analysis) CGM outcomes were calculated. For each descriptive CGM outcome measure, 95% CIs were computed in patients with GSDIa and healthy volunteers, respectively. CGM overestimation was higher under preprandial and level 1 hypoglycemia (ie, capillary glucose values ≥ 3.0 mmol/L and < 3.9 mmol/L) conditions. GV and TAR were higher while TIR was lower in patients with GSDIa compared to healthy volunteers (P < 0.05).

Advanced CGM analysis revealed a distinct pattern (ie, first- and second-order derivatives and glucose curve amplitude) in each of these 3 patients within the patients group. This is the first study to prospectively compare CGM outcomes between adult patients with GSDIa and matched healthy volunteers.

Since in vitro propagation can lead to (epi-)genetic mutations and possibly malignant transformation of the starting cell population, we set out to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation status in uncultured and cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ sorted cells and compare them with germ cell tumor samples of the seminoma subtype. Seminomas displayed a severely global hypomethylated profile, including loss of genomic imprinting, which we did not detect in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells. Differential methylation analysis revealed altered regulation of gamete formation and meiotic processes in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells but not in seminomas. The pivotal POU5F1 marker was hypomethylated in seminomas but not in uncultured or cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells, which is reflected in the POU5F1 mRNA expression levels. Lastly, seminomas displayed a number of characteristic copy number variations that were not detectable in primary testicular ITGA6+ cells, either before or after culture. Together, the data show a distinct DNA methylation patterns in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells that does not resemble the pattern found in seminomas, but also highlight the need for more sensitive methods to fully exclude the presence of malignant cells after culture and to further study the epigenetic events that take place during in vitro culture.},

The aim of this study was to identify DNA-methylation loci associated with plasma lipids in Ghanaians. We conducted an EWAS using Illumina 450k DNA-methylation array profiles of extracted DNA from 663 Ghanaian participants. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were examined for association with plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and technical covariates. Findings were replicated in independent cohorts of different ethnicities. We identified one significantly associated DMP with triglycerides (cg19693031 annotated to TXNIP, regression coefficient beta -0.26, false discovery rate adjusted p-value 0.001), which replicated in-silico in South African Batswana, African American, and European populations. From the top five DMPs with the lowest nominal p-values, two additional DMPs for triglycerides (CPT1A, ABCG1), two DMPs for LDL-cholesterol (EPSTI1, cg13781819), and one for TC (TXNIP) replicated. With the exception of EPSTI1, these loci are involved in lipid transport/metabolism or are known GWAS-associated loci. The top 5 DMPs per lipid trait explained 9.5% in the variance of TC, 8.3% in LDL-cholesterol, 6.1% in HDL-cholesterol, and 11.0% in triglycerides. The top DMPs identified in this study are in loci that play a role in lipid metabolism across populations, including West-Africans. Future studies including larger sample size, longitudinal study design and translational research is needed to increase our understanding on the epigenetic regulation of lipid metabolism among West-African populations.

The derivation of gene regulatory networks from high-throughput expression data via machine learning strategies is problematic as the reliability of these models is often compromised by limited and highly variable samples, heterogeneity in transcript isoforms, noise, and other artifacts. Here, we develop a novel algorithm, dubbed Dandelion, in which we construct and train intraspecies Bayesian networks that are translated and assessed on independent test sets from other species in a reiterative procedure. The interspecies disease networks are subjected to multi-layers of analysis and evaluation, leading to the identification of the most consistent relationships within the network structure. In this study, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on datasets from animal models of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and patient materials. We show that the interspecies network of genes coding for the proteasome provide highly accurate predictions on gene expression levels and disease phenotype. Moreover, the cross-species translation increases the stability and robustness of these networks. Unlike existing modeling approaches, our algorithms do not require assumptions on notoriously difficult one-to-one mapping of protein orthologues or alternative transcripts and can deal with missing data. We show that the identified key components of the OPMD disease network can be confirmed in an unseen and independent disease model. This study presents a state-of-the-art strategy in constructing interspecies disease networks that provide crucial information on regulatory relationships among genes, leading to better understanding of the disease molecular mechanisms.},

Redo antireflux surgery in GERD and hiatal hernia is known for higher morbidity and mortality. This study aims to evaluate conventional versus robot-assisted laparoscopic redo antireflux surgery, with the objective to detect possible advantages for the robot-assisted approach. A single institute cohort of 75 patients who underwent either conventional laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic redo surgery for recurrent GERD or severe dysphagia between 2008 and 2013 were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, medical history, procedural data, hospital stay, complications and outcome were prospectively gathered. The main indications for redo surgery were dysphagia, pyrosis or a combination of both in combination with a proven anatomic abnormality. The mean time to redo surgery was 1.9 and 2.0 years after primary surgery for the conventional and robot-assisted groups, respectively. The number of conversions was lower in the robot-assisted group compared to conventional laparoscopy (1/45 vs. 5/30, p = 0.035) despite a higher proportion of patients with previous surgery by laparotomy (9/45 vs. 1/30, p = 0.038). Median hospital stay was reduced by 1 day (3 vs. 4, p = 0.042). There were no differences in mortality, complications or outcome. Robotic support, when available, can be regarded beneficial in redo surgery for GERD and hiatal hernia. Results of this observational study suggest technical feasibility for minimal-invasive robot-assisted redo surgery after open primary antireflux surgery, a reduced number of conversions and shorter hospital stay.},

This study aimed to provide information on the morbidity and mortality of robot-assisted complex hiatal hernia repair and redo anti-reflux surgery in a high-volume center. All patients that underwent robot-assisted hiatal hernia repair, redo hiatal hernia repair, and anti-reflux surgery between 2011 and 2017 at the Meander Medical Centre, Amersfoort, the Netherlands were evaluated. Primary endpoints were 30-day morbidity and mortality. Major complications were defined as Clavien-Dindo ≥ IIIb. Primary surgery 211 primary surgeries were performed by two surgeons. The median age was 67 (IQR 58-73) years. 84.4% of patients had a type III or IV hernia (10.9% Type I; 1.4% Type II; 45.5% Type III; 38.9% Type IV, 1.4% no herniation). In 3.3% of procedures, conversion was required. 17.1% of patients experienced complications. The incidence of major complications was 5.2%. Ten patients (4.7%) were readmitted within 30 days. Symptomatic early recurrence occurred in two patients (0.9%). The 30-day mortality was 0.9%. Redo surgery 151 redo procedures were performed by two surgeons. The median age was 60 (IQR 51-68) years. In 2.0%, the procedure was converted. The overall incidence of complications was 10.6%, while the incidence of major complications was 2.6%. Three patients (2.0%) were readmitted within 30 days. One patient (0.7%) experienced symptomatic early recurrence. No patients died in the 30-day postoperative period. This study provides valuable information on robot-assisted laparoscopic repair of primary or recurrent hiatal hernia and anti-reflux surgery for both patient and surgeon. Serious morbidity of 5.2% in primary surgery and 2.6% in redo surgery, in this large series with a high surgeon caseload, has to be outweighed by the gain in quality of life or relief of serious medical implications of hiatal hernia when counseling for surgical intervention.},

We report here the long-term results of modified Belsey fundoplication (Gastroesophageal Valvuloplasty; GEV) performed laparoscopically using a surgical robot. Patients who underwent robotic GEV were reviewed retrospectively. Operations were performed by laparoscopy and included robotic dissection of the esophageal hiatus, primary closure of the hiatus, followed by intussusception of a 4 cm segment of the esophagus into the stomach for 270°, and suspension of the fundoplication on the hiatal closure. The results were assessed by postoperative endoscopy, contrast esophagography, a Subjective Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ), and objective Visick grading. There were 291 patients (156 male, 135 female, mean age 51±14 years). Indications were intractability (73%) and pulmonary symptoms (27%). Mean operative time was 130 minutes ± 52 minutes. Minor complications were seen in 21%. There was no mortality. Mean hospitalization was 2.8 days ± 1.7 days. Mean follow-up was 85 months ± 7 months. During this period, the mean SSQ score decreased from 8.3 ± 0.6 to 0.7± 0.2 (P < 0.05). There was no long-term dysphasia or gas bloat. Ninety-five percent of patients were Visick I and 5% were Visick II. Hiatal hernia recurred in 7 patients (2%). Robotic laparoscopic modified Belsey fundoplication (GEV) is associated with excellent long-term durability, reflux control, and low rates of dysphasia and gas bloat. This procedure may represent an alternative to medical antireflux therapy and other surgical antireflux procedures such as Nissen fundoplication.},

Preoperative anaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In general practice, little attention is paid to these anaemic patients. Some will have oral iron prescribed others not. The waiting period prior to elective colorectal surgery could be used to optimize a patients' physiological status. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of preoperative intravenous iron supplementation in comparison with the standard preoperative oral supplementation in anaemic patients with colorectal cancer. In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, patients with an M0-staged colorectal carcinoma who are scheduled for curative resection and with a proven iron deficiency anaemia are eligible for inclusion. Main exclusion criteria are palliative surgery, metastatic disease, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (5 × 5 Gy = no exclusion) and the use of Recombinant Human Erythropoietin within three months before inclusion or a blood transfusion within a month before inclusion. Primary endpoint is the percentage of patients that achieve normalisation of the haemoglobin level between the start of the treatment and the day of admission for surgery. This study is a superiority trial, hypothesizing a greater proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint in favour of iron infusion compared to oral supplementation. A total of 198 patients will be randomized to either ferric(III)carboxymaltose infusion in the intervention arm or ferrofumarate in the control arm. This study will be performed in ten centres nationwide and one centre in Ireland. This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of preoperative iron supplementation in exclusively anaemic patients with a colorectal carcinoma. Our trial hypotheses a more profound haemoglobin increase with intravenous iron which may contribute to a superior optimisation of the patient's condition and possibly a decrease in postoperative morbidity.

The objective of this survey was to explore regional anaesthesia practices across Europe, including the differences in procedures, use of ultrasound, reporting of complications, guidelines, training and patient safety implementation. A Faculty of European regional anaesthesia experts developed a survey of 27 questions focused on respondent and institution profile, anaesthesia services, patient and safety management, training, use of guidelines, and the implementation of NRFit The survey was disseminated across several European countries via professional networks. There were 794 respondents from 36 European countries. The survey demonstrated that use of regional anaesthesia is growing in Europe and is supported by new technologies. Although some results are consistent with expected trends and applications (e.g. procedures predominantly performed by anaesthesiologists), there are inconsistencies in practice across European countries, especially in the specific regional anaesthesia procedures utilised for different clinical applications and the recording and reporting of regional anaesthesia complications. These inconsistencies also extended to which guidelines are primarily followed and how training is implemented. There were also variations in the general awareness and uptake of the ISO standard for NRFit. The survey results highlight a clear need for standardisation and consistency in the use and management of regional anaesthesia across Europe. The faculty put forth several calls to action that could provide major steps in the right direction towards meeting that goal, including the establishment of European best practices, development of a complication reporting system and implementation of educational programmes to highlight the importance of NRFit.},

Prospective, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Closed-format 22-bed mixed intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients > or =18 yrs with sepsis, according to international criteria, and at least one early sign of organ dysfunction, as the principal reason for intensive care unit admission, were eligible for enrollment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive nitroglycerin (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35) after fulfillment of protocol-driven resuscitation end points. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00493415. Primary outcome was sublingual microcirculatory blood flow of small vessels, as assessed by side-stream dark field imaging. After protocolized resuscitation, we observed recruitment of sublingual microcirculation in both groups, as indicated by a significant improvement in the microcirculatory flow index after 24 hrs, in comparison to baseline. However, no difference in the sublingual microvascular flow index was observed between groups. The median microvascular flow index in sublingual small-sized vessels was 2.71 (1.85-3) in the nitroglycerin group and 2.71 (1.27-3), p = .80, in the placebo group. In medium-sized vessels, the respective values were 3 (2.75-3) vs. 2.86 (2.19-3), p = .21, and in large-sized vessels, 3 (3-3) vs. 3 (2.89-3), p = .06. In-hospital mortality, as a secondary outcome, was 34.3% in the nitroglycerin group and 14.2% in the placebo group, p = .09. In the context of a strict resuscitation protocol, based upon fulfillment of systemic hemodynamic end points in patients with early-phase severe sepsis or septic shock, we conclude that intravenous nitroglycerin does not promote sublingual microcirculatory blood flow.},

Visual exposure to an unfamiliar vegetable increased the acceptance of that vegetable even without consuming it, while visual exposure to a familiar vegetable did not. A stepwise introduction of vegetables resulted in better initial acceptance of vegetables than introducing vegetables directly. Observational studies showed that vegetable consumption was associated with frequency of exposure, exposure to variety, and modelling. A majority of studies found a positive association between breastfeeding and vegetable acceptance, but only two out of seven studies found an association between age of vegetable introduction and their acceptance. Based on the papers reviewed, we conclude that introducing vegetables at the beginning of complementary feeding, giving a different type of vegetable every day and ensuring repeated exposure to the same vegetable following an interval of a few days are the most promising strategies to promote vegetable intake in children starting complementary feeding until they are 3 years of age.},

  abstract = {The low vegetable intake in children may be attributed to their low preference for vegetables. During the first year of life, first taste preferences are formed, which may track over time. In a previous study to increase infants' vegetable intake and liking, we found that at the start of weaning, infants had a higher vegetable intake in the lab after repeated exposure to vegetable purées than to fruit purées. The current study is a follow-up of these infants at the age of 12 and 23 months, and examined whether the group that started weaning with vegetables continued eating more vegetables than the group that started weaning with fruits. At 12 (n = 86) and 23 (n = 81) months of age the children's daily vegetable consumption was reported by their parents using a 3-day food diary. The intake of green beans and apple purée was measured in the laboratory. Reported daily intake of vegetables at 12 months of age was 38 % higher (P = 0.02) in the vegetable group (75 ± 43 g) than in the fruit group (54 ± 29 g), but was similar for both groups at 23 months of age (49 ± 43, 57 ± 35 g, respectively; NS). Both at 12 and 23 months of age, apple and green beans intake in the lab did not differ significantly between the groups. These findings suggest that weaning exclusively with vegetables results in a higher daily vegetable consumption until at least 12 months of age. More research is needed to investigate how to maintain this effect.},

University hospital. 6 ASA physical status III and IV patients with end-stage liver disease, undergoing liver transplantation. Neuromuscular transmission was monitored electromyographically. After recovery of T1/T0 to 10%, cisatracurium was infused at an initial rate of 1.5 microg/kg/min. The infusion rate was adjusted to maintain T1/T0 at 10%. At the end of surgery, spontaneous recovery from the neuromuscular block was awaited. The infusion rate of cisatracurium was 1.6 +/- 0.4 microg/kg/min. Before the anhepatic phase, this rate was 1.5 +/- 0.4 microg/kg/min; during the anhepatic phase it was 1.7 +/- 0.5 microg/kg/min; and after reperfusion it was 1.9 +/- 0.4 microg/kg/min. There was a significant difference between the cisatracurium infusion rates before and after the anhepatic phase (p < 0.05). Following termination of the infusion, the time to 25% recovery of T1/T0 was 19.2 +/- 6.1 minutes, the recovery index (25% to 75%) was 28.8 +/- 7.0 minutes, and the time for the train-of-four (TOF) ratio to reach 0.7 was 50.2 +/- 7.1 minutes. The time for the TOF ratio to reach 0.9 was 61.4 +/- 6.6 minutes. There was no difference in body temperature or pH during the consecutive stages of transplantation. The infusion dose requirement for cisatracurium during liver transplantation tended to be higher than previously reported in healthy patients; recovery appeared prolonged. In continuous infusion of cisatracurium during liver transplantation, the tendency toward higher dose requirements, the protracted duration of infusion, the non-Hofmann elimination and/or other pharmacokinetic changes during transplantation might influence recovery from the neuromuscular block. Potential temperature or pH change during surgery seemed irrelevant in explaining the delayed recovery.},

We performed a multicentre randomised controlled trial in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands, the RAVEL trial. Costs were analysed from a health care perspective alongside the RAVEL trial. Pregnant women of intermediate to high risk beyond 32 weeks gestation who planned vaginal delivery. Women were randomised before the onset of labour, to receive either patient controlled remifentanil or epidural analgesia when pain relief was requested during labour. Primary outcome for effectiveness was satisfaction with pain relief, expressed as the area under the curve (AUC). A higher AUC represents higher satisfaction with pain relief. Here, we present an economic analysis from a health care perspective including costs from the start of labour to ten days postpartum. Health-care utilization was documented in the Case Report Forms and by administering an additional questionnaire. The costs in the patient controlled remifentanil group (n = 687) and in the epidural group (n = 671) were €2900 versus €3185 respectively (mean difference of -€282 (95% CI -€611 to €47)). The (non-significant) higher costs in the epidural analgesia group could be mainly attributed to higher costs of neonatal admission. From an economic perspective, there is no preferential pain treatment in labouring intermediate to high risk women. Since patient controlled remifentanil is not equivalent to epidural analgesia with respect to AUC for satisfaction with pain relief we recommend epidural analgesia as the method of choice. However, if appropriately counselled on effect and side effects there is, from an economic perspective, no reason to deny women patient controlled remifentanil.},

General anaesthesia is the recommended method of sedation during these procedures. However, this patient population is at an increased risk of anaesthetic complications, and the best approach to general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation is unknown. The aims of this study were to describe the anaesthetic management techniques used during bronchoscopic lung volume reduction procedures and to investigate the number of anaesthesia-related events. Data were retrospectively collected from all endobronchial valve and lung volume reduction coil procedures performed between January 2018 and March 2020 in our hospital. Primary outcomes measures were anaesthetic technique including airway management; ventilation mode and settings; and the incidence of anaesthesia-related events, classified as catastrophic, severe, significant, or moderate. 202 procedures were included. One procedure was performed under procedural sedation, 198 (98%) under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation, and 3 (1.5%) under general anaesthesia with laryngeal mask airway. Volume-controlled ventilation was used in 64% of the procedures and pressure-controlled in 36%. Patients were ventilated with a median respiration rate of 9.9 (IQR: 9.6-10.6) breaths per minute, mean tidal volume of 5.8 ± 1.4 mL/kg, and median inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio of 1:2.8 (IQR: 1:2.1-1:3.2). No catastrophic anaesthesia-related events were observed. Hypotension was the most observed anaesthesia-related event. Despite the presence of advanced COPD, general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation are well tolerated by patients undergoing endobronchial valve or lung volume reduction coil treatment. This is presumably strongly linked to the strict selection criteria. Other important considerations are using a low respiratory rate, low tidal volume, and high I:E ratio.},

Online survey with members of the DGP from July to September 2023 using Qualtrics®. The study group developed the questionnaire based on current literature; it was adapted following an initial application among young physicians and an interprofessional panel of experts with consensus voting. Data was analysed using descriptive and explorative statistics. 991 DGP-members (18%) participated, of which physicians made up 57.0% (n = 545/957) and nurses 23.4% (n = 224/957). Of the participants, 197/851 (23.1%) incorrectly stated that assisted suicide is prohibited by professional code, 430/914 (47.1%) rejected a restriction of palliative care teams to suicide prevention measures, and 766/930 (82.4%) rejected personal involvement in assisted suicide regardless of a patient's health status. For patients in palliative situations, 473/926 (51.1%) could imagine participating in assisted suicide, and 71% wanted new legislation regulating assisted suicide. There are gaps in the knowledge of the participating members of the DGP regarding the legal and professional status of assisted suicide. Further educational work is needed in this regard. The participants can more easily imagine assisted suicide for people in palliative disease trajectories. As in surveys of members of other medical societies, the attitudes of more experienced staff are reflected. Compared to younger healthcare professionals, they have a more restrictive attitude towards the concept of assisted suicide.},

The use of virtual care for balancing access with treatment needs requires a shared decision between clients, caregivers, and clinicians. One aspect for consideration is the length of treatment necessary to achieve desired outcomes and whether it differs by treatment modality. Insights gained from the comparison of treatment duration between modalities may improve our understanding of the effectiveness of virtual care and help to inform clinical decision-making and effective use of resources. We sought to improve our understanding of how treatment modality impacts treatment duration for children and adolescents accessing Community Mental Health and Addictions services at IWK Health following the rapid implementation of virtual care in March 2020. In this study, we aimed to compare the duration of treatment within episodes of care by treatment modality and determine whether client characteristics, system factors, or time period influenced any associations between treatment modality and treatment duration. Episodes of care were created using administrative data collected by the IWK Mental Health and Addictions program and used as the unit of analysis. A multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial model and time-to-event analysis were used to model the association between treatment modality and treatment duration, both in visits and days, adjusting for client and system characteristics. Virtual episodes of care had more visits than in-person episodes between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021 (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.38-1.83), and April 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022 (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.35), whereas between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023, virtual episodes of care were associated with fewer visits (IRR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.91). Comparable results were seen for treatment duration in days (2020-2021: hazard ratio [HR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.76; 2021-2022: HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.90; and 2022-2023: HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97-1.25). These differences by time period relative to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and switch to virtual care were consistent after adjusting for client and system characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between virtual or in-person treatment modality and treatment duration. While initially longer than in-person episodes of care, both in numbers of visits and length in days, over time the average length of episodes conducted mainly virtually had attenuated. These findings may be due to growing comfort with the technology or client factors not adequately captured in administrative data. This information can be valuable to clinicians, clients, and their families regarding expected treatment timelines and aid in informing service planning.},

It explored whether latency to first fixation and dwell time on emotional faces (female and male) are dependent on anxiety symptoms and social competence, and if social competence accounts for the association of anxiety with attention allocation. With increasing anxiety symptoms, participants' dwell time on neutral compared to angry female faces increased, yet no effects were observed for male faces. Similarly, with decreasing social competence, participants' dwell time on neutral compared to angry female faces increased, yet no differences were observed for male faces. Contrary to the hypothesis, social competence did not account for the effects of anxiety on attention allocation. No effects were observed for latency to first fixation. Anxiety and social competence are both independently associated with attentional biases toward facial expressions in female participants. Yet, these associations seemed to depend on the gender of the face seen.},

  abstract = {The primary goal of intensive care medicine is to overcome a critical phase of illness using all available means and to enable patients to survive and return to an independent life without intensive care. However, this therapeutic goal cannot always be achieved. The possibility of death, the need to alleviate suffering, and respect for the end of life make it necessary to integrate palliative approaches into intensive care medicine. Supporting seriously ill and dying patients and their relatives in intensive care units requires an attitude that holistically recognizes and respects their individuality and is shared by the entire team. In addition to recognizing life and death, reliable structures, clear agreements, and palliative care skills among the respective professional groups are necessary. When implementing these approaches, it is important to remain within the framework of legal requirements and to take the wishes of those affected into account. In addition to the relevant professional expertise, the most important tool is respectful and clear communication with all those involved and affected. Help should be available at all times in cases of uncertainty regarding ethical and palliative issues, as well as in cases of psychological stress.},

  abstract = {While attentional biases towards negative stimuli have previously been linked to the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, a current limitation of this research involves the use of static images for stimuli, as they cannot adequately depict the dynamic nature of real-life interactions. Since attentional biases in those with elevated anxiety remain understudied using more naturalistic stimuli, such as dynamic social videos, the purpose of this explorative study was to use novel dynamic stimuli and modern eye-tracking equipment to further investigate negative attentional biases in anxious emerging, female adults. Non-clinical participants (N = 62; mean age = 20.44 years; biologically female) completed validated questionnaires regarding their anxiety symptoms and completed a free-viewing task by watching 30-s video clips while having their eye movements tracked. The video clips were shown in side-by-side pairs (i.e., positive-neutral, negative-neutral, and positive-negative) on a split screen without audio. Overall, participants fixated more quickly on emotional videos (i.e., positive and negative) over neutral ones, with more anxious participants orienting their gaze faster to the videos, regardless of content. Moreover, individuals with greater self-reported anxiety spent more time gazing at negative videos in negative-neutral pairings, highlighting that emerging female adults with increased anxiety symptoms may show a negative attention bias when viewing social interactions. Importantly, by incorporating novel, dynamic stimuli, we expand upon prior research on attentional biases, with the potential to adapt this approach for novel interventions that may ultimately help those suffering from anxiety.},

  abstract = {Arctic amplification of climate change is causing sea ice to retreat at unprecedented rates, potentially opening up large vulnerable Arctic areas for oil and gas exploration and new shipping routes. This rapid warming marginalizes sympagic species habitats making them more sensitive to other anthropogenic pressures. Here, we assess potential impacts of hypothetic oil spills from the northernmost licensed oil field Wisting and additional neighbouring spill sites in areas currently not open to oil exploitation on the key ice-associated Arctic fish species polar cod (Boreogadus saida). We do this by developing and running combined data-driven models for the ocean, oil spill dispersal and fate, and the early life stages of polar cod. Sea ice and the Polar Front act as natural barriers limiting the exchange of polar cod eggs and larvae and oil spill between Atlantic and Polar Water. However, both barriers vary seasonally so that the sea ice retreats and the Polar Front weakens towards summer causing significant increases in oil exposure to early life stages of polar cod under varying oil spill scenarios investigated here. Previous literature emphasizes that fall feeding conditions must be sufficient for juvenile polar cod to allocate lipids and survive their first winter. Here, we show that less than half the exposed individuals experience these suitable feeding conditions in the fall. The seasonal exposure intensity suggests a need for petroleum regulations with temporal and spatial limitations varying through the year. However, even with these seasonal dynamic regulations in place, climate change induced by the use of fossil fuel will likely reduce these natural barriers through continued sea ice retreat and a weakening of the Polar Front thereby reducing their barrier effects. Risk assessments of anthropogenic impacts on key Arctic ecosystem components in the vicinity of the ice edge zone and the Polar Front will therefore have to be updated to account for these major changes.},

  abstract = {Mental health disorders are the leading cause of health-related problems worldwide. It is projected that mental health disorders will be the leading cause of morbidity among adults as the incidence rates of anxiety and depression grow worldwide. Recently, "extended reality" (XR), a general term covering virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), is paving the way for the delivery of mental health care. We aimed to investigate the adoption and implementation of XR technology used in interventions for mental disorders and to provide statistical analyses of the design, usage, and effectiveness of XR technology for mental health interventions with a worldwide demographic focus. In this paper, we conducted a scoping review of the development and application of XR in the area of mental disorders. We performed a database search to identify relevant studies indexed in Google Scholar, PubMed, and the ACM Digital Library. A search period between August 2016 and December 2023 was defined to select papers related to the usage of VR, AR, and MR in a mental health context. The database search was performed with predefined queries, and a total of 831 papers were identified. Ten papers were identified through professional recommendation. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed and applied to ensure that only relevant studies were included in the literature review. We identified a total of 85 studies from 27 countries worldwide that used different types of VR, AR, and MR techniques for managing 14 types of mental disorders. By performing data analysis, we found that most of the studies focused on high-income countries, such as the United States (n=14, 16.47%) and Germany (n=12, 14.12%). None of the studies were for African countries. The majority of papers reported that XR techniques lead to a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety or depression. The majority of studies were published in 2021 (n=26, 30.59%). This could indicate that mental disorder intervention received higher attention when COVID-19 emerged. Most studies (n=65, 76.47%) focused on a population in the age range of 18-65 years, while few studies (n=2, 3.35%) focused on teenagers (ie, subjects in the age range of 10-19 years). In addition, more studies were conducted experimentally (n=67, 78.82%) rather than by using analytical and modeling approaches (n=8, 9.41%). This shows that there is a rapid development of XR technology for mental health care. Furthermore, these studies showed that XR technology can effectively be used for evaluating mental disorders in a similar or better way that conventional approaches. In this scoping review, we studied the adoption and implementation of XR technology for mental disorder care. Our review shows that XR treatment yields high patient satisfaction, and follow-up assessments show significant improvement with large effect sizes. Moreover, the studies adopted unique designs that were set up to record and analyze the symptoms reported by their participants. This review may aid future research and development of various XR mechanisms for differentiated mental disorder procedures.},

Numerous stroke severity scales assessing motor and cortical signs have been designed for direct patient contact; however, none have been purposely designed for emergency calls. This study aimed to prospectively validate the novel Freiburg Neurointerventional Score (FRENS) in patients presenting with a suspected acute stroke to detect aLVO. Patients aged ≥18 years with suspected acute stroke brought directly to our tertiary hospital by paramedics, between May 2021 and 2022, were included in this study. We used the FRENS and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) to analyse the FRENS convergent validity. We evaluated and compared the predictive ability and test characteristics of the FRENS and five established NIHSS-based stroke severity scales for the detection of an aLVO stroke. We analysed the number of steps required for the completion of the FRENS algorithm. Among the 1042 analysed patients, the FRENS items showed high convergent validity with corresponding NIHSS items. A positive FRENS was statistically significantly correlated with an aLVO stroke. The FRENS had the highest sensitivity and negative predictive values for an aLVO stroke and the highest sensitivity value for M2 occlusions. The FRENS provided results after two and all four steps, in 71% and <3% of cases, respectively. The FRENS enabled the rapid, sensitive detection of an aLVO in patients with suspected acute stroke. Designed for use in emergency calls, the FRENS requires translation and validation in a prehospital setting.},

The course of two consanguineous patients with CHH are presented with a follow-up of >30 years. NextSeq 500 sequencing was performed and confined on known genes with autosomal recessive inheritance, namely ABCC8 (MANE Select: NM_00352.6), HADH (MANE Select: NM_005327.7) and KCNJ11 (MANE Select: NM_00525.4). Acylcarnitine-profiles were measured and 68Ga-DOTA Exendin PET/CT was performed. CHH was diagnosed in both patients in the neonatal period. A therapy with Diazoxid was initiated, which initially stabilized the disease in both children. With advancing age more hypoglycemic events occurred with an increase in carbohydrate intake leading to obesity in both patients. In addition to Diazoxide Somatostatin analogues were successfully added in adulthood. A genetic analysis documented a new homozygote mutation in the HADH gene (HADH-variant c.796G>T). Acyl-Carnitine profile showed an increased plasma Butyryl-carnitine, consistent with a dysfunction of the HADH enzyme. 68Gallium-DOTA-exendin showed an increased uptake in the whole pancreas in both patients. Clinical presentation, biochemical work-up and therapeutical response to Diazoxide and somatostatin analogues are consistent with previous reports of HADH-mutations. The overexpression of GLP-1 receptors in this context warrants further research.},

However, Phytophthora secreted proteins that interact with plant-hosts remain underexplored. Here, auxiliary activity family 7 (AA7) enzymes from Ascomycota and Oomycota phytopathogens were shown to oxidise pectin-derived galacturonic acid and/or oligogalacturonides (OGs). Unique mono-cysteinyl-FAD oxidases with positively-charged active sites, suited to oxidise OGs, were discovered in Phytophthora sojae. The P. sojae OG oxidase genes, prevalent in this genus, were co-transcribed with pectin-degradation counterparts during early infection of soybean. Single OG oxidase knockouts significantly decreased P. sojae biomass in planta, potentially linking OG oxidases to virulence. We propose that oxidation by AA7 enzymes impairs the elicitor activity of OGs, potentially contributing to stealth Oomycota infection. Oxidation of OGs unravels a previously unknown microbial mechanism that contributes to evade plant immune-response against pathogens. Our findings highlight a unique oxidase architecture and hitherto unexplored targets for bioprotection from major plant pathogens.},

Possible factors influencing attitudes towards PAS were analyzed. A total of 1163 records (response rate 82.1%) were analyzed. Of the participants, 90.8% had experience with dying patients, 62.3% supported PAS only in palliative scenarios, 20.1% supported PAS regardless of the health status, 33.1% have been asked for PAS, and 3.3% had participated in PAS. In addition, 71.0% did not know the content of the Federal Constitutional Court's decision on § 217, 72.0% were not informed about the legislative proposals for the new regulation of PAS, and 66.4% saw doctors as the right person to decide whether a suicidal wish is permissible. Younger doctors differentiate in their attitude towards PAS between people without illnesses and those in palliative treatment situations. Further investigations into the causes of the frequent ignorance of the normative foundations are necessary. The results suggest that more educational work needs to be done about suicide alternatives and palliative care options.},

  abstract = {When stroke patients with suspected anterior large vessel occlusion (aLVO) happen to live in rural areas, two main options exist for prehospital transport: (i) the drip-and-ship (DnS) strategy, which ensures rapid access to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) at the nearest primary stroke center but requires time-consuming interhospital transfer for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) because the latter is only available at comprehensive stroke centers (CSC); and (ii) the mothership (MS) strategy, which entails direct transport to a CSC and allows for faster access to EVT but carries the risk of IVT being delayed or even the time window being missed completely. The use of a helicopter might shorten the transport time to the CSC in rural areas. However, if the aLVO stroke is only recognized by the emergency service on site, the helicopter must be requested in addition, which extends the prehospital time and partially negates the time advantage. We hypothesized that parallel activation of ground and helicopter transportation in case of aLVO suspicion by the dispatcher (aLVO-guided dispatch strategy) could shorten the prehospital time in rural areas and enable faster treatment with IVT and EVT. As a proof-of-concept, we report a case from the LESTOR trial where the dispatcher suspected an aLVO stroke during the emergency call and dispatched EMS and HEMS in parallel. Based on this case, we compare the provided aLVO-guided dispatch strategy to the DnS and MS strategies regarding the times to IVT and EVT using a highly realistic modeling approach. With the aLVO-guided dispatch strategy, the patient received IVT and EVT faster than with the DnS or MS strategies. IVT was administered 6 min faster than in the DnS strategy and 22 min faster than in the MS strategy, and EVT was started 47 min earlier than in the DnS strategy and 22 min earlier than in the MS strategy. In rural areas, parallel activation of ground and helicopter emergency services following dispatcher identification of stroke patients with suspected aLVO could provide rapid access to both IVT and EVT, thereby overcoming the limitations of the DnS and MS strategies.},

It is usually diagnosed in childhood and requires a multidisciplinary lifelong approach including a structured transitional care process. This study therefore seeks to enrich our understanding of transitional care for individuals with 22q11DS by exploring the insights from healthcare professionals (HCPs) from Europe and Canada with multidisciplinary backgrounds. This interview study was part of a larger mixed-methods research project, with the qualitative component concentrating on gathering insights from HCPs involved in patient care through semi-structured interviews. We conducted qualitative thematic analysis while focusing on transitional care within families caring for a child with 22q11DS from the perspective of HCPs. The 20 HCPs interviewed came from diverse professional backgrounds and all had clinical experience with 22q11DS. Our analysis of the data identified three primary themes. Our participants emphasized the inadequacy of the transitional care system, despite its critical importance. HCPs tried their best to overcome the challenges by relying on longer follow-up with their patients, with some even merging children and adult services. There was a shared desire among HCPs for a structured transitional care plan, better access to adult services for 22q11DS, and a more integrated, collaborative approach. This study highlights the inadequacy of transitional care for individuals with 22q11DS and their families, showing a need to better align policies and clinical practice. Filling the gap between existing policies and the desired transitional care services is essential. The latter includes: an appropriate longitudinal transition plan, strong psychological support not only for the individual with 22q11DS but also for their family, a coordination system, and accessible adult services with expertise on 22q11DS.},

  abstract = {Sexting is a common phenomenon. Sexting has been largely negatively portrayed as being linked to increased risks for poor mental well-being, cyberbullying, dating abuse, and intimate partner violence. However, sexting can also have positive effects and increase sexual well-being and relationship satisfaction. Therefore, the current study explored whether the motivations underlying sexting might help explain the divergence in its positive or negative outcomes. In a longitudinal online study, 405 emerging adults aged 18-29 years (223 women, 171 men, and 21 individuals identifying as non-binary or another gender) participated. All participants had engaged in sexting within the past three months and were in either a casual or committed relationship; they reported their sexting behaviors, autonomous and controlled motivations for sexting, as well as both positive and negative sexting outcomes at two time points, spaced six weeks apart. Structural equation modeling revealed a direct effect of more sexting behaviors (β = 0.13, p = .02) and an indirect effect via greater controlled motives (β = 0.09, p < .001) on more negative sexting outcomes. In contrast, only an indirect effect of more sexting behaviors on more positive sexting outcomes via greater autonomous motives (β = 0.12, p < .001) was observed. Results suggest instead of proclaiming abstinence from sexting, awareness should be increased as to why emerging adults engage in sexting so they can benefit from sexting while limiting any detrimental effects.},

  abstract = {Offshore produced water (PW) is one of the largest and most chemically complex effluents of waste directly and intentionally discharged into the marine environment. Although it is well known that PW can be severely toxic to marine organisms, the mechanisms of toxicity remain poorly understood, contributed by the lack of comprehensive chemical characterization of the PW. In this study, we applied elements of effects-directed analysis with the aim to identify organic chemical drivers of toxicity in PW towards fish early life stages. A solvent extract of a PW was fractioned based on compound functionality and chemically characterized by a concert of techniques including high-resolution gas and liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The effect of PW and fractions on survival, development, and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos was tested. It is evident that embryotoxicity of PW organics cannot be attributed to one compound class. In this study, the fractions primarily containing production chemicals were of low toxicity, whereas both fractions containing petroleum hydrocarbons, and fractions containing oxidation products of these, contributed to toxicity.},

  abstract = {Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric problems among Canadian youth and typically have an onset in childhood or adolescence. They are characterized by high rates of relapse and chronicity, often resulting in substantial impairment across the lifespan. Genetic factors play an important role in the vulnerability toward anxiety disorders. However, genetic contribution to anxiety in youth is not well understood and can change across developmental stages. Large-scale genetic studies of youth are needed with detailed assessments of symptoms of anxiety disorders and their major comorbidities to inform early intervention or preventative strategies and suggest novel targets for therapeutics and personalization of care. The Genetic Architecture of Youth Anxiety (GAYA) study is a Pan-Canadian effort of clinical and genetic experts with specific recruitment sites in Calgary, Halifax, Hamilton, Toronto, and Vancouver. Youth aged 10-19 (n = 13,000) will be recruited from both clinical and community settings and will provide saliva samples, complete online questionnaires on demographics, symptoms of mental health concerns, and behavioural inhibition, and complete neurocognitive tasks. A subset of youth will be offered access to a self-managed Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy resource. Analyses will focus on the identification of novel genetic risk loci for anxiety disorders in youth and assess how much of the genetic risk for anxiety disorders is unique or shared across the life span. Results will substantially inform early intervention or preventative strategies and suggest novel targets for therapeutics and personalization of care. Given that the GAYA study will be the biggest genomic study of anxiety disorders in youth in Canada, this project will further foster collaborations nationally and across the world.},

  abstract = {The oil industry's expansion and increased operational activity at older installations, along with their demolition, contribute to rising cumulative pollution and a heightened risk of accidental oil spills. The lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) is a keystone prey species in the North Sea and coastal systems. Their eggs adhere to the seabed substrate making them particularly vulnerable to oil exposure during embryonic development. We evaluated the sensitivity of sandeel embryos to crude oil in a laboratory by exposing them to dispersed oil at concentrations of 0, 15, 50, and 150 µg/L oil between 2 and 16 days post-fertilization. We assessed water and tissue concentrations of THC and tPAH, cyp1a expression, lipid distribution in the eyes, head and trunk, and morphological and functional deformities. Oil droplets accumulated on the eggshell in all oil treatment groups, to which the embryo responded by a dose-dependent rise in cyp1a expression. The oil exposure led to only minor sublethal deformities in the upper jaw and otic vesicle. The findings suggest that lesser sandeel embryos are resilient to crude oil exposure. The lowest observed effect level documented in this study was 36 µg THC/L and 3 µg tPAH/L. The inclusion of these species-specific data in risk assessment models will enhance the precision of risk evaluations for the North Atlantic ecosystems.},

Due to their work, nurses are close to the patient and their perspective should therefore be included. In this study, potential triggers were first identified and then a questionnaire was developed to analyse their acceptance among German intensive care nurses. For the qualitative part of this mixed methods study, focus groups were conducted with intensive care nurses from different disciplines (surgery, neurosurgery, internal medicine), which were selected by convenience. Data were analysed using the "content-structuring content analysis" according to Kuckartz. For the quantitative study part, the thus identified triggers formed the basis for questionnaire items. The questionnaire was tested for comprehensibility in cognitive pretests and for feasibility in a pilot survey. In the qualitative part six focus groups were conducted at four university hospitals. From the data four main categories (prognosis, interprofessional cooperation, relatives, patients) with three to 15 subcategories each could be identified. The nurses described situations requiring palliative care consults that related to the severity of the disease, the therapeutic course, communication within the team and between team and patient/relatives, and typical characteristics of patients and relatives. In addition, a professional conflict between nurses and physicians emerged. The questionnaire, which was developed after six cognitive interviews, consists of 32 items plus one open question. The pilot had a response rate of 76.7% (23/30), whereby 30 triggers were accepted with an agreement of ≥ 50%. Intensive care nurses see various triggers, with interprofessional collaboration and the patient's prognosis playing a major role. The questionnaire can be used for further surveys, e.g. interprofessional triggers could be developed.},

Adulteration, substitution, dilution, and incorrect labeling of seafood products are fraudulent practices that violate consumer safety. In this context, developing sensitive, robust, and high-throughput molecular tools for food and feed authentication is becoming crucial for regulatory purposes. Analytical approaches such as proteomics mass spectrometry have shown promise in detecting incorrectly labeled products. For the application of these tools, genome information is crucial, but currently, for many marine species of commercial importance, such information is unavailable. However, when combining proteomic analysis with spectral library matching, commercially important fish species were successfully identified, differentiated, and quantified in pure muscle samples and mixtures, even when genome information was scarce. This study further tested the previously developed spectral library matching approach to differentiate between 29 fish species from the North Sea and examined samples including individual fish, laboratory-prepared mixtures and commercial products. For authenticating libraries generated from 29 fish species, fresh muscle samples from the fish samples were matched against the reference spectral libraries. Species of the fresh fish samples were correctly authenticated using the spectral library approach. The same result was obtained when evaluating the laboratory-prepared mixtures. Furthermore, processed commercial products containing mixtures of two or three fish species were matched against these reference spectral libraries to test the accuracy and robustness of this method for authentication of fish species. The results indicated that the method is suitable for the authentication of fish species from highly processed samples such as fish cakes and burgers. The study shows that current and future challenges in food and feed authentication can efficiently be tackled by reference spectral libraries method when prospecting new resources in the Arctic.},

Data on efficient pharmacotherapy for SQT1 are scarce. In patients with primary carnitine-deficiency, acquired-short QT syndrome (SQTS) has been observed and rescued by carnitine supplementation. Here, we assessed whether carnitine exerts direct beneficial (prolonging) effects on cardiac repolarization in genetic SQTS. Adult wild-type (WT) and transgenic SQT1 rabbits (HERG-N588K, gain of IKr) were used. In vivo electrocardiograms (ECGs), ex vivo monophasic action potentials (APs) in Langendorff-perfused hearts, and cellular ventricular APs and ion currents were assessed at baseline and during L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine-perfusion. Two-dimensional computer simulations were performed to assess re-entry-based ventricular tachycardia-inducibility. L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine prolonged QT-intervals in WT and SQT1, leading to QT-normalization in SQT1. Similarly, monophasic and cellular AP duration (APD) was prolonged by L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine in WT and SQT1. As underlying mechanisms, we identified acute effects on the main repolarizing ion currents: IKr-steady, which is pathologically increased in SQT1, was reduced by L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine and deactivation kinetics were accelerated. Moreover, L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine decreased IKs-steady and IK1. In silico modelling identified IKr changes as the main factor for L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine-induced APD-prolongation. 2D simulations revealed increased sustained re-entry-based arrhythmia formation in SQT1 compared to WT, which was decreased to the WT-level when adding carnitine-induced ion current changes. L-Carnitine/C16-Carnitine prolong/normalize QT and whole-heart/cellular APD in SQT1 rabbits. These beneficial effects are mediated by acute effects on IKr. L-Carnitine may serve as a potential future QT-normalizing, anti-arrhythmic therapy in SQT1.},

Expression in Xenopus oocytes and voltage-clamping allowed the characterization of Arabidopsis GAT2 (At5g41800) as a low affinity GABA transporter with a K0.5GABA ~8 mM. l-Alanine and butylamine represented additional substrates. GABA-induced currents were strongly dependent on the membrane potential, reaching the highest affinity and highest transport rates at strongly negative membrane potentials. Mutation of Ser17, previously reported to be phosphorylated in planta, did not result in altered affinity. In a short-term stress experiment, AtGAT2 mRNA levels were up-regulated at low water potential and under osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol and mannitol). Furthermore, AtGAT2 promoter activity was detected in vascular tissues, maturating pollen, and the phloem unloading region of young seeds. Even though this suggested a role for AtGAT2 in long-distance transport and loading of sink organs, under the conditions tested neither AtGAT2-overexpressing plants, atgat2 or atgat1 T-DNA insertion lines, nor atgat1 atgat2 doubleknockout mutants differed from wild-type plants in growth on GABA, amino acid levels, or resistance to salt and osmotic stress.},

We analyzed the postoperative outcomes and long-term intervention rates for pediatric patients undergoing extended end-to-end CoA repair without cardiopulmonary bypass between October 2002 and January 2024 at the Leipzig Heart Center. Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Among 168 patients, the median age at surgery was 11 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-26). There was no early mortality.

Identifying putative causal variants associated with fertility may help to improve the accuracy of genomic prediction of fertility. Combining expression data (eQTL) of genes, exons, gene splicing and allele specific expression is a promising approach to fine map QTL to get closer to the causal mutations. Another approach is to identify genomic differences between cows selected for high and low fertility and a selection experiment in New Zealand has created exactly this resource. Our objective was to combine multiple types of expression data, fertility traits and allele frequency in high- (POS) and low-fertility (NEG) cows with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on calving interval in Australian cows to fine-map QTL associated with fertility in both Australia and New Zealand dairy cattle populations. Variants that were significantly associated with calving interval (CI) were strongly enriched for variants associated with gene, exon, gene splicing and allele-specific expression, indicating that there is substantial overlap between QTL associated with CI and eQTL. We identified 671 genes with significant differential expression between POS and NEG cows, with the largest fold change detected for the CCDC196 gene on chromosome 10. Our results provide numerous candidate genes associated with female fertility in dairy cattle, including GYS2 and TIGAR on chromosome 5 and SYT3 and HSD17B14 on chromosome 18. Multiple QTL regions were located in regions with large numbers of copy number variants (CNV). To identify the causal mutations for these variants, long read sequencing may be useful. Variants that were significantly associated with CI were highly enriched for eQTL. We detected 671 genes that were differentially expressed between POS and NEG cows. Several QTL detected for CI overlapped with eQTL, providing candidate genes for fertility in dairy cattle.},

By implementing spectra with small spatial step for dissecting spectral features within sub-micrometer distances, we reveal that huntingtin inclusions partition into a β-sheet-rich core and a ɑ-helix-rich shell. We further demonstrate that this structural partition exists only in cells with the [RNQ},

It exhibits broad phenotypic variability, often including conditions like autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Caregivers of children with 22q11DS are known to be at increased risk of poor mental health and less social support, which might affect their children's health. The current study examined the relationship between parental mental health, perceived social support, and child mental health (internalizing/externalizing symptoms) in children with 22q11DS. Ninety caregivers of children with 22q11DS completed an online survey measuring parental depressive symptoms, perceived social support, and child mental health problems (internalizing and externalizing symptoms). Structural equation models were run to examine the postulated relationships between variables. The caregiver's depressive symptoms were associated with higher internalizing and externalizing symptoms in their children with 22q11DS (mean age 11.8, SD 7.6 years). Caregivers experiencing symptoms of depression were less likely to report strong social support, and lower perceived social support was associated with greater child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. The relationship between caregiver's depressive symptoms and internalizing symptoms in their children was mediated by perceived social support, but no such mediating effects were observed for externalizing symptoms. These findings provide valuable insights into the mental health burdens facing families living with 22q11DS. Interventions focusing on 22q11DS should integrate techniques to foster social and other supports to improve the mental health of caregivers and children.},

Substrate selectivity analysis confirmed Psf1 as being endo-acting and indicated that the enzyme catalyzes hydrolysis of α(1 → 3)-glycosidic fucoidan linkages. Psf1 had temperature optimum of 10-30 °C but retained activity at 1 °C. Structural modeling indicated similarity to the crystal structure of P5A_FcnA (Psychromonas sp.

Here we further explore this relationship in a mock decentralized study. Adult ResearchMatch volunteers were invited to join a prospective study where interested individuals were given an opportunity to view details for a study along with participation requirements, then offered a randomly generated compensation amount between $0 and $50 to enroll and participate. Individuals agreeing to participate were then asked to complete tasks using a remote mobile application (MyCap), for two weeks. Tasks included a weekly survey, a daily gratitude journal and daily phone tapping task. Willingness to participate was 85% across all incentive levels but not significantly impacted by amount. Task completion appeared to increase as a function of compensation until a plateau at $25. While participants described the study as low burden and reported that compensation was moderately important to their decision to join, only 31% completed all study tasks. While offering compensation in this study did not have a strong effect on enrollment rate, this work provides insight into participant motivation when joining and participating in studies employing mobile applications.},

Prehospital identification of these symptoms is generally considered difficult by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. Therefore, we evaluated the simple non-paretic-hand-to-opposite-ear (NPE) test to identify aphasia and neglect with a single test. As the NPE test includes a test for arm paresis, we also evaluated the diagnostic ability of the NPE test to detect LAVO in patients with suspected stroke. In this prospective observational study, we performed the NPE test in 1042 patients with suspected acute stroke between May 2021 and May 2022. We analyzed the correlation between the NPE test and the aphasia/neglect items of the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Additionally, the predictive values of the NPE test for LAVO detection were calculated. The NPE test showed a strong, significant correlation with both aphasia and neglect. A positive NPE test result predicted LAVO with a sensitivity of 0.70, a specificity of 0.88, and an accuracy of 0.85. Logistic regression analysis showed an odds ratio of 16.14 (95% confidence interval 10.82-24.44) for predicting LAVO. The NPE test is a simple test for the detection of both aphasia and neglect. With its predictive values for LAVO detection being comparable to the results of LAVO scores in the prehospital setting, this simple test might be a promising test for prehospital LAVO detection by EMS personnel. Further prospective prehospital validation is needed.},

In 19 of the patients out of this study CNs were detected by OCT in the target lesion and were treated by either IVL or RA. The mean angle of CNs was significantly larger in final OCT scans than before RA (92 ± 17° vs. 68 ± 7°; p = 0.01) and IVL (89 ± 18° vs. 60 ± 10°; p = 0.03).

Pathway analysis at 10 days post-hatch (dph), 11 days after cessation of oil exposure, indicates downregulation of inflammatory and reparative pathways. By 18 dph, tissue-specific analyses reveal activation of these pathways, especially in head tissues, alongside upregulation of neuronal signaling pathways. This highlights the complex relationship between oil exposure and transcriptional responses, emphasizing recovery mechanisms represented by regulation of inflammatory, repair and wound healing pathways following oil exposure. The activation of repair pathways in surviving larvae suggests compensatory processes to address oil-induced damage. These novel insights enhance understanding of the molecular mechanisms of oil toxicity and the lasting effects on marine organisms.},

Over 90% of the escapees were infected with one or more viruses. Overall prevalences were: 75.7% for piscine orthoreovirus (PRV-1), 43.6% for salmonid alphavirus (SAV), 31.2% for piscine myocarditis virus (PMCV), 1.2% for infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) and 0.4% for salmon anaemia virus (ISAV). A significantly higher prevalence of PMCV infection was observed in immature compared to mature individuals. The prevalence of both SAV and PMCV infections was higher in fish determined by fatty acid profiling to be 'recent' as opposed to 'early' escapees that had been in the wild for a longer period of time. This is the first study to establish a time-series of viral infection status of escapees entering a river with a native salmon population. Our results demonstrate that farmed escapees represent a continuous source of infectious agents which could potentially be transmitted to wild fish populations.},

This shortens cardiac repolarization and QT intervals, predisposing patients to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of KCNH2-specific suppression-and-replacement (KCNH2-SupRep) gene therapy in a transgenic rabbit model of SQT1. KCNH2-SupRep was developed by combining a KCNH2-shRNA with its corresponding shRNA-immune KCNH2-cDNA into an AAV9 vector, delivered directly into the aortic root (1x1010 vg/kg). Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in vivo by electrocardiogram, ex vivo by optical mapping, and at cellular levels by patch-clamp, calcium imaging, and qPCR in ventricular cardiomyocytes (VCMs). In vivo, KCNH2-SupRep normalized the heart rate-corrected QT (QTc) in SQT1 rabbits, without affecting repolarization heterogeneity. Ex vivo, KCNH2-SupRep corrected the action potential duration (APD90) and resolved the increased apicobasal APD90 heterogeneity observed in untreated (UT)-SQT1 hearts, supporting an antiarrhythmic effect, which was further validated by reduced re-entry formation in silico. At cellular levels, KCNH2-SupRep prolonged APD90 in VCMs from SupRep-SQT1 rabbits closer to wildtype levels compared to UT- and sham-SQT1. Additionally, KCNH2-SupRep restored the cellular surrogate of the electro-mechanical window and normalized IKr in nearly 50% of VCMs, in line with a 50-60% suppression of the mutant KCNH2 transcript. This proof-of-concept study is the first to demonstrate the efficacy of gene therapy for SQT1 in a medium-sized animal model. KCNH2-SupRep gene therapy successfully corrected the pathologic phenotype in vivo, ex vivo and at cellular levels in transgenic SQT1 rabbits.},

Not every desire to die is accompanied by a pressure to act, but usually by a burden that can arise from various factors. To address this burden appropriately, health care workers should be trained. Based on an evaluated course on handling the desire to die, an elective course for medical students was developed and evaluated. In order to identify the impact of the elective course's content, a comparison of attitudes towards assisted dying with two other participant groups was conducted. Therefore, three questions from the evaluation of the elective course were used. Online evaluation of the elective and questions addressing attitude were assessed using a five-point Likert scale. The specific outcome-based assessment was determined using the Comparative Self-Assessment Gain. The main participant group (group 1) were students who took the elective. The additional survey on attitudes towards assisted dying included undergraduate medical students who had taken compulsory palliative care courses (group 2) and physicians who had taken an introductory course in intensive care or emergency medicine (group 3). Group 1 (n = 13, response rate rr = 86.7%) was very satisfied with the blended learning format (100%) and the course itself (100%). They were able to deepen their knowledge (81.0%) and train skills (71.2%) through the course. In the additional surveys, there were 37 students in group 2 (rr = 66.1%) and 258 physicians in group 3 (rr = 73.6%). Willingness to assist with or accompany the various options for assisted dying varied according to the type of assistance. Among the participants, it can be summarised that the highest willingness was shown by the students of group 2 followed by the physicians of group 3 and the students of group 1. A course on handling the desire to die of palliative patients can deepen knowledge and train communication skills and thus support self-confidence. Dealing with the background of the desire to die, knowledge about assisted dying, but also one's own attitudes and responsibilities can influence the attitude towards assisted dying.},

Despite several modifications to the ASA physical status classification, multimorbidity as such is still not considered. Thus, the aim of this study was to quantify the burden of comorbidities in perioperative patients and to assess, independent of ASA class, its potential influence on perioperative outcome. In a subpopulation of the prospective ClassIntra® validation study from eight international centres, type and severity of anaesthesia-relevant comorbidities were additionally extracted from electronic medical records for the current study. Patients from the validation study were of all ages, undergoing any type of in-hospital surgery and were followed up until 30 days postoperatively to assess perioperative outcomes. Primary endpoint was the number of comorbidities across ASA classes. The associated postoperative length of hospital stay (pLOS) and Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI®) were secondary endpoints. On a scale from 0 (no complication) to 100 (death) the CCI® measures the severity of postoperative morbidity as a weighted sum of all postoperative complications. Of 1421 enrolled patients, the mean number of comorbidities significantly increased from 1.5 in ASA I (95% CI, 1.1-1.9) to 10.5 in ASA IV (95% CI, 8.3-12.7) patients. Furthermore, independent of ASA class, postoperative complications measured by the CCI® increased per each comorbidity by 0.81 (95% CI, 0.40-1.23) and so did pLOS (geometric mean ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06). These data quantify the high prevalence of multimorbidity in the surgical population and show that the number of comorbidities is predictive of negative postoperative outcomes, independent of ASA class.},

  abstract = {Currently, the vast majority of atom probe instruments in use are commercial systems with closed, proprietary software. This is limiting for many experiments where low-level access to machine control, experiment data, or custom instrument setups is necessary. Over the past decade, advancements in off-the-shelf detector systems, fast data bus systems, and the availability of high-level programming languages such as Python have made it feasible to design and construct atom probe systems without extensive engineering expertise. Despite this progress, developing control system software, associated instruments, and data calibration algorithms remains a significant challenge for many projects. In this article, we introduce an atom probe control system that can be flexibly adapted to various hardware configurations. This system also includes essential instrument and experiment calibration algorithms, offering complete transparency to the user. This framework provides flexibility for innovative experiments and enhances calibration accuracy not possible with commercial systems. The methods and algorithms discussed are implemented in Python Control and Calibration for Atom Probe Tomography (PyCCAPT), which is an open-source solution for APT, addressing a gap in experimental control and data processing. While not compatible with commercial atom probes for data acquisition, its calibration module can be used for direct-flight-path systems and adapted for reflection-based instruments.},

  abstract = {Neonatal intracardiac masses are rare and pose significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, particularly in differentiating thrombi from tumors. We present the case of a preterm neonate with a right atrial mass of uncertain etiology. Multimodal imaging, including echocardiography and cardiac MRI, suggested the presence of a thrombus-consistent with thrombi being the most common type of intracavitary cardiac mass. As a result, primary anticoagulation therapy was initiated. However, after 16 days without significant change in the mass and given the high risk of embolization and the possibility of a benign tumor, surgical excision was performed. Histopathological analysis of the excised tissue could not definitively distinguish between an organized thrombus and a regressed benign neoplasm, although no malignant cells were identified. This case highlights the diagnostic uncertainty surrounding neonatal intracardiac masses and the limitations of imaging and pathology in achieving definitive diagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach and long-term follow-up are essential, particularly when the true nature of the mass remains unclear.},

  abstract = {Histopathologic studies have identified immunoglobulin (Ig) deposition and complement activation as contributors of CNS tissue damage in multiple sclerosis (MS). Intrathecal IgM synthesis is associated with higher MS disease activity and severity, and IgM is the strongest complement-activating immunoglobulin. In this study, we investigated whether complement components (CCs) and complement activation products (CAPs) are increased in persons with MS, especially in those with an intrathecal IgM synthesis, and whether they are associated with disease severity and progression. CC and CAP levels were quantified in plasma and CSF of 112 patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 127 patients with MS (90 relapsing-remitting, 14 primary progressive, and 23 secondary progressive), 31 inflammatory neurologic disease, and 44 symptomatic controls from the Basel CSF databank study. Patients with CIS/MS were followed in the Swiss MS cohort study (median 6.3 years). Levels of CC/CAP between diagnosis groups were compared; in CIS/MS, associations of CC/CAP levels with intrathecal Ig synthesis, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, MS Severity Score (MSSS), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were investigated by linear regression, adjusted for age, sex, and albumin quotient. CSF (but not plasma) levels of C3a, C4a, Ba, and Bb were increased in patients with CIS/MS, being most pronounced in those with an additional intrathecal IgM production. In CIS, doubling of C3a and C4a in CSF was associated with 0.31 (CI 0.06-0.56;  CNS-compartmentalized activation of the classical and alternative pathways of complement is increased in CIS/MS and associated with the presence of an intrathecal IgM production. Increased complement activation within the CSF correlates with EDSS, future MSSS, and NfL levels, supporting the concept that complement activation contributes to MS pathology and disease progression. Complement inhibition should be explored as therapeutic target to attenuate disease severity and progression in MS.},

Should these compounds be discovered in fish as they have in ragworm, rodents, and humans, they could present an indicative biomarker for assessing oil pollution. In this study, the ability to biotransform alkyl PAHs to PAAs was examined on Atlantic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). Exposure to phenanthrene, 1-methyphenanthrene or 1,4-dimethylphenanthrene was performed via intraperitoneal injection. An Ion Mobility Quadrupole Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (IMS-Q-TOF MS) was used in exploratory analysis of extracted bile samples. Acquisition of four-dimensional information by coupling liquid chromatography with the IMS-Q-TOF MS and in-silico prediction for feature prioritization in the data processing workflow allowed several tentative identifications with high degree of confidence. This work presents the first detection of PAAs in fish and suggests the importance of investigating alkyl PAHs in ecotoxicological studies of oil-polluted fish environments.},

Nevertheless, the implications of this classification for patients with grade 2 meningiomas, a particularly heterogeneous tumor entity, are only partially understood. We correlate the outcomes of histopathologically confirmed grade 2 meningioma with an integrated molecular-morphologic risk stratification and determine its clinical implications. Grade 2 meningioma patients treated at our institution were re-classified using an integrated risk stratification involving DNA methylation array-based data, copy number assessment and TERT promoter mutation analyses. Grade 2 meningioma cases according to the WHO 2021 criteria treated between 2007 and 2021 (n = 100) were retrospectively analyzed. The median clinical and radiographic follow-up periods were 59.8 and 54.4 months. A total of 38 recurrences and 17 deaths were observed. The local control rates of the entire cohort after 2-, 4-, and 6-years were 84.3%, 68.5%, and 50.8%, with a median local control time of 77.2 months. The distribution of the integrated risk groups were as follows: 31 low, 54 intermediate, and 15 high risk cases. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, integrated risk groups were significantly associated with the risk of local recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) intermediate: 9.91, HR high-risk: 7.29, p < 0.01). Gross total resections decreased the risk of local tumor progression (HR gross total resection: 0.19, p < 0.01). The comparison of 1p status and integrated risk groups (low vs. intermediate/high) revealed nearly identical local control rates within their respective subgroups. In summary, only around 50% of WHO 2021 grade 2 meningiomas have an intermediate risk profile. Integrated molecular risk stratification is crucial to guide the management of patients with grade 2 tumors and should be routinely applied to avoid over- and undertreatment, especially concerning the use of adjuvant radiotherapy.},

Responses were received and analyzed from 42 of 89 centers (43%), with 16 centers (38.1%) reporting implemented ERACS protocols for pediatric cardiac surgery. Preoperative anemia assessment is common (73.8%), but anemia treatment and preoperative transfusion practices vary. In centers following ERACS protocols fasting times are reduced particularly for clear fluids (<1 hour: 50% v 26.9%) and light meals (<4 hours: 62.5% v 26.9%). However, preoperative assessment of nutritional status is performed only rarely (42.9% overall; 18.8% in ERACS centers). Drain removal tends to occur earlier in centers following ERACS protocols (within 12 hours: 33.3% v 4.8%). ERACS implementation for children undergoing cardiac surgery varies substantially among the responding centers and is overall low, particularly during the preoperative period. ERACS centers show a higher implementation of measures such as a liberal approach to preoperative fasting and early drain removal but lack in other measures, such as preoperative treatment of anemia and assessment of nutritional status. Overall, these data demonstrate a large potential for improvement in the preoperative and postoperative management of children undergoing cardiac surgery.},

In this regard, Physical Education (PE) serves as a foundation to regular and lifelong participation in PA, mainstream and/or disability sport. Research points towards manifold participation barriers for children with BVI in PE, which so far have mainly been investigated in inclusive settings and from the perspectives of sighted parents, teachers and peers. Consequently, people with BVI frequently consider PE a missed opportunity for lifelong PA. As transitioning from general to special schooling deems the only alternative to continue their education, questions arise in how far and in which ways specialized schools manage to accommodate their needs in PE. To address these gaps in literature, we investigated BVI students' perceived opportunities and barriers to participation in PE within a specialized school setting and their imaginations for possible (digital) improvements and solutions. Within the framework of Inclusive and Youth Participatory Action Research, we adopted the Mosaic Approach to investigate a sample of 19 students aged 14-20 at lower and upper secondary level in a specialized school in Austria. Data material included audio-recordings of interviews, student-guided school tours, photographs of significant places and objects and field protocols. The analysis was conducted with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Through the analysis, we identified three themes. The data material firstly revealed the complex intricacies of how PE teachers can act as facilitators and gatekeepers to autonomous PA. Secondly, material norms function not only as barriers to participation even in a specialized school setting, but also constitute the basis for social hierarchies between students with various degrees of visual impairment. Thirdly, students imagined manifold digital solutions to enhance participation derived from their perceived barriers. The findings contribute to amplifying BVI individuals' voices and provide revealing insights in how participation in PA is enabled and prohibited for students with BVI which can not only help to improve specialized but also inclusive settings.},

However, the existing literature presents mixed results indicating both significant and insignificant effects of smartphone-delivered interventions. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the impact of smartphone-delivered ABMT on attentional bias and symptoms of mental health problems. Specifically, we examined different design approaches and methods of administration, focusing on common mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, and design elements, including gamification and stimulus types. Our search spanned from 2014 to 2023 and encompassed 4 major databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus. Study selection, data extraction, and critical appraisal were performed independently by 3 authors using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. When necessary, we pooled the standardized mean difference with a 95% CI. In addition, we conducted sensitivity, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses to explore moderator variables of active and placebo ABMT interventions on reducing symptoms of mental health problems and attentional bias. Our review included 12 papers, involving a total of 24,503 participants, and we were able to conduct a meta-analysis on 20 different study samples from 11 papers. Active ABMT exhibited an effect size (Hedges g) of -0.18 (P=.03) in reducing symptoms of mental health problems, while the overall effect remained significant. Similarly, placebo ABMT showed an effect size of -0.38 (P=.008) in reducing symptoms of mental health problems. In addition, active ABMT (Hedges g -0.17; P=.004) had significant effects on reducing attentional bias, while placebo ABMT did not significantly alter attentional bias (Hedges g -0.04; P=.66). Our understanding of smartphone-delivered ABMT's potential highlights the value of both active and placebo interventions in mental health care. The insights from the moderator analysis also showed that tailoring smartphone-delivered ABMT interventions to specific threat stimuli and considering exposure duration are crucial for optimizing their efficacy. This research underscores the need for personalized approaches in ABMT to effectively reduce attentional bias and symptoms of mental health problems.

We performed a randomized comparison of the selective anterograde cerebral perfusion (SACP) and SACP with additional distal perfusion (SACP+DP) with moderate hypothermia in a neonate piglet model to generate better insights into renal tissue-specific injury due to the different perfusion strategies in newborns. Newborn piglets (2.5-10 kg) were randomized to undergo cross-clamp for 60 min with either SACP (n = 9) or SACP+DP (n = 9) followed by 120 min of recovery. Renal biopsies were analysed for histomorphological changes and the induction of hypoxia-related factors. Kidney injury markers were analysed in piglet serum. Histomorphological analyses of renal biopsies after 120-min recovery showed comparable glomeruli area (P = 0.06), glomerular capsule space length (P = 0.25), proximal tubules cell height (P = 0.09) and diameters of proximal tubules (P = 0.23) between SACP and SACP+DP. hypoxia-inducible factor 1α nuclear translocation, a marker for oxidative stress, was higher in the glomeruli (P < 0.01) and proximal tubules (P = 0.05) in the SACP group compared to the SACP+DP group. Serum concentrations of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were higher in the SACP group (100.3 ± 40.8 ng/ml) compared to the SACP+DP group (67.4 ± 19.3 ng/ml, P = 0.03). Our neonate piglet study demonstrated higher oxidative stress in vulnerable nephron structures in renal tissue and higher serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin concentrations with SACP compared to SACP+DP indicating that SACP+DP is more suitable to reduce renal insult induced by complex aortic arch procedures.},

Despite guideline-recommendations, little is known about specialist palliative care involvement in LVAD-patients, especially in Europe. This study aims to investigate timing and setting of specialist palliative care in LVAD-patients. We conducted a retrospective multicenter study in 2022. Specialist palliative care services in German LVAD-centers were identified and invited to participate. Forty adult LVAD-patients (mean age 65 years (SD 7.9), 90% male) from seven centers that received a specialist palliative care consultation during hospitalization were included. In 37 (67.3%) of the 55 LVAD-centers, specialist palliative care was available. The median duration between LVAD-implantation and first specialist palliative care contact was 17 months (IQR 6.3-50.3 months). Median duration between consultation and death was seven days (IQR 3-28 days). 65% of consults took place in an intensive/intermediate care unit with half of the patients having a Do-Not-Resuscitate order. Care planning significantly increased during involvement (advance directives before: n = 15, after: n = 19, p < 0.001; DNR before: n = 20, after: n = 28, p < 0.001). Symptom burden as assessed at first specialist palliative care contact was higher compared to the consultation requests (request: median 3 symptoms (IQR 3-6); first contact: median 9 (IQR 6-10); p < 0.001) with a focus on weakness, anxiety, overburdening of next-of-kin and dyspnea. More than 70% of patients died during index hospitalization, one third of these in a palliative care unit. This largest European multicenter investigation of LVAD-patients receiving specialist palliative care shows a late integration and high physical and psychosocial symptom burden. This study highlights the urgent need for earlier integration to identify and address poorly controlled symptoms.

  abstract = {Life in an intensive care unit (ICU) involves the successful use of life-sustaining treatment and patients dying. In intensive care medicine, allowing a patient to die often means discontinuing life-sustaining measures. Together with the severity of the illness, this has a significant impact on the course of the dying process. End of life treatment and support focus on alleviating symptoms. The interprofessional team's task in the ICU is to anticipate, plan and implement palliative measures. A family-centered approach to palliative care requires providing human resources for psychosocial support and spiritual care for those affected. Implementing internal recommendations for action improves the quality of care. Training in the necessary skills to support people at the end of life is an integral component of education and ongoing professional development. This training includes basic knowledge of palliative care as well as specific knowledge about terminating life-sustaining measures.},

  abstract = {Multivariate techniques better fit the anatomy of complex neuropsychiatric disorders which are characterized not by alterations in a single region, but rather by variations across distributed brain networks. Here, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns of covariance across brain regions and relate them to clinical and demographic variables in a large generalizable dataset of individuals with bipolar disorders and controls. We then compared performance of PCA and clustering on identical sample to identify which methodology was better in capturing links between brain and clinical measures. Using data from the ENIGMA-BD working group, we investigated T1-weighted structural MRI data from 2436 participants with BD and healthy controls, and applied PCA to cortical thickness and surface area measures. We then studied the association of principal components with clinical and demographic variables using mixed regression models. We compared the PCA model with our prior clustering analyses of the same data and also tested it in a replication sample of 327 participants with BD or schizophrenia and healthy controls. The first principal component, which indexed a greater cortical thickness across all 68 cortical regions, was negatively associated with BD, BMI, antipsychotic medications, and age and was positively associated with Li treatment. PCA demonstrated superior goodness of fit to clustering when predicting diagnosis and BMI. Moreover, applying the PCA model to the replication sample yielded significant differences in cortical thickness between healthy controls and individuals with BD or schizophrenia. Cortical thickness in the same widespread regional network as determined by PCA was negatively associated with different clinical and demographic variables, including diagnosis, age, BMI, and treatment with antipsychotic medications or lithium. PCA outperformed clustering and provided an easy-to-use and interpret method to study multivariate associations between brain structure and system-level variables. PRACTITIONER POINTS: In this study of 2770 Individuals, we confirmed that cortical thickness in widespread regional networks as determined by principal component analysis (PCA) was negatively associated with relevant clinical and demographic variables, including diagnosis, age, BMI, and treatment with antipsychotic medications or lithium. Significant associations of many different system-level variables with the same brain network suggest a lack of one-to-one mapping of individual clinical and demographic factors to specific patterns of brain changes. PCA outperformed clustering analysis in the same data set when predicting group or BMI, providing a superior method for studying multivariate associations between brain structure and system-level variables.},

Recent case reports of severe allergic transfusion reactions (ATRs) in Group O patients receiving Group B plasma and platelets raise the possibility of a new adverse event, herein called transfusion-related AGS (TRAGS). The primary goal of this study was to assess the frequency of Groups B and AB plasma and platelet transfusions to Group O patients. In this multi-site retrospective study, participating sites submitted the numbers of platelet and plasma transfusions administered during a 2-year period categorized by patient and product ABO group. Fourteen sites from 10 countries participated. Group O patients received Group AB for an average of 9.9% (range 2.8%-29.2%) of plasma transfusions and Group B for 3.2% (0%-12.8%). AB plasma transfusion to Group O patients represented 4.5% (0.9%-14.6%) of the total plasma transfused; Group B 1.4% (0%-5.1%). Group O patients received Group AB for an average of 1.5% (range 0%-5.9%) of platelet transfusions and Group B for 4.1% (0%-14.2%). AB platelet transfusion to Group O patients represented 0.6% (0%-2.7%) of the total platelets transfused; Group B platelets were 1.8% (0%-6.7%). Evidence supporting the possibility of a new adverse event, TRAGS, is accumulating. This study quantifies how often Group O patients may be exposed to Group B antigen in Group B or AB plasma and/or platelet transfusions, providing an estimate of the scope of potential risk for TRAGS.},

  abstract = {In order to successfully move from place to place, our brain often combines sensory inputs from various sources by dynamically weighting spatial cues according to their reliability and relevance for a given task. Two of the most important cues in navigation are the spatial arrangement of landmarks in the environment, and the continuous path integration of travelled distances and changes in direction. Several studies have shown that Bayesian integration of cues provides a good explanation for navigation in environments dominated by small numbers of easily identifiable landmarks. However, it remains largely unclear how cues are combined in more complex environments. To investigate how humans process and combine landmarks and path integration in complex environments, we conducted a series of triangle completion experiments in virtual reality, in which we varied the number of landmarks from an open steppe to a dense forest, thus going beyond the spatially simple environments that have been studied in the past. We analysed spatial behaviour at both the population and individual level with linear regression models and developed a computational model, based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), to infer the underlying combination of cues. Overall homing performance was optimal in an environment containing three landmarks arranged around the goal location. With more than three landmarks, individual differences between participants in the use of cues are striking. For some, the addition of landmarks does not worsen their performance, whereas for others it seems to impair their use of landmark information. It appears that navigation success in complex environments depends on the ability to identify the correct clearing around the goal location, suggesting that some participants may not be able to see the forest for the trees.},

  abstract = {Endovascular thrombectomy (ET), combined with intravenous thrombolysis if possible, is an effective treatment option for patients with stroke who have confirmed anterior large vessel occlusion (aLVO). However, ET is mainly limited to comprehensive stroke centers (CSCs), resulting in a lack of ET capacity in remote, sparsely populated areas. Most stroke networks use the "Drip and Ship" or "Mothership" strategy, resulting in either delayed ET or intravenous thrombolysis, respectively. This study protocol introduces the Leitstellen-Basierte Erkennung von Schlaganfall-Patienten für eine Thrombektomie und daraufhin abgestimmte Optimierung der Rettungskette (LESTOR) strategy, developed to optimize the preclinical part of the stroke chain of survival to improve the clinical outcome of patients with suspected aLVO stroke. This involves refining the dispatch strategy for identifying patients with acute aLVO stroke using a phone-based aLVO query. This includes dispatching emergency physicians and emergency medical services (EMS) to urban emergency sites, as well as dispatching helicopter EMS to remote areas. If a highly suspected aLVO is identified after a standardized aLVO score evaluation during a structured examination at the emergency scene, prompt transport to a CSC should be prioritized. The LESTOR study is a controlled, nonrandomized study implementing the LESTOR strategy, with a stepped-wedge, cluster trial design in 6 districts in southwest Germany. In an interprofessional, iterative approach, an aLVO query or dispatch protocol intended for use by dispatchers, followed by a coordinated aLVO examination score for use by EMS, is being developed, evaluated, and pretested in a simulation study. After the training of all participating health care professionals with the corresponding final aLVO query, the LESTOR strategy is being implemented stepwise. Patients otherwise receive usual stroke care in both the control and intervention groups. The primary outcome is the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days in patients with stroke receiving endovascular treatment. We will use a generalized linear mixed model for data analysis. This study is accompanied by a cost-effectiveness analysis and a qualitative process evaluation. This paper describes and discusses the protocol for this controlled, nonrandomized LESTOR study. Enrollment was completed in June 2023. Data analysis is ongoing and the first results are expected to be submitted for publication in 2024. The project started in April 2020 and will end in February 2024. We expect that the intervention will improve the clinical outcome of patients with aLVO stroke, especially outside the catchment areas of CSCs. The results of the accompanying process evaluation and the cost-effectiveness analysis will provide further insights into the implementation process and allow for a better interpretation of the results.

However, data on emergency medical dispatchers' (EMDs) ability to recognize aLVO symptoms remain limited. This simulation study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of identifying side-specific arm paresis, side-specific conjugate eye deviation (CED), and aphasia during emergency calls by instructing layperson callers to perform brief, standardized examination steps. Two communication methods were compared: (1) telephone calls and (2) video calls. Forty-eight laypersons interacted with simulated patients presenting various stroke syndromes. Simulated EMDs conducted standardized assessments during simulated emergency calls, guiding laypersons through patient examinations. In 96 telephone-assisted and 95 video-assisted calls, EMDs identified aLVO stroke symptoms with high accuracy. In telephone calls, accuracy was 0.92 for side-specific arm paresis, 0.98 for side-specific CED, and 0.88-0.99 for aphasia. In video calls, accuracy was 0.97 for side-specific arm paresis, 0.97 for side-specific CED, and 0.94-1.00 for aphasia. These findings suggest that EMDs can identify stroke symptoms indicative for aLVO via both telephone and video calls using a standardized dispatch protocol to guide lay bystanders. This study provides a foundation for future real-world research on implementing aLVO detection protocols in emergency dispatch.},

The prospective questionnaire study included physicians participating in intensive care and emergency medicine courses and nurses who were training or working in intensive and emergency care. Self-reported spiritual competencies were assessed using the Spiritual Care Competence Questionnaire (SCCQ), which captures the following areas: perceptual competence, team-spirit, documentation competence, self-awareness and proactive opening, knowledge about other religions, competence in conversation techniques and proactive empowerment-competence. We included 465 physicians (50% female, years in profession: mean = 4.0, standard deviation [SD] = 3.5) and 86 nurses (80% female, years in profession: mean = 12.7, SD = 10.7). The average SCC was 2.3 (SD 0.4) out of a maximum of 4 points, with higher spiritual competences among spiritual and religious respondents. There were differences in specific competencies between the professions and genders. Women indicated a higher level of competence in the area of perception and conversation skills, physicians in documentation skills.

Prospective, 79-item, web-based cross-sectional survey. Web-based survey endorsed by the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology and Intensive Care. Anesthesiologists of European pediatric cardiac surgical centers. None. Of a total of 98 centers, 50 responded. Eight responses were excluded due to incomplete survey forms or non-European location, leaving 42 responses (42.9%) for statistical analysis. Sixteen of the 42 centers (38.1%) follow an ERAS concept. Only 3 (7.1%) have formalized and detailed the ERAS concept in a written document, covering the entire perioperative period, while 13 (31%) have formalized it solely for the intraoperative period. Regarding regional and local anesthesia, 13 (31%) centers regularly practice regional anesthesia blocks, and 11 (26.2%) centers use wound infiltration by the surgical team. This European survey revealed that implementation of ERAS concepts in pediatric cardiac surgery is generally low, with considerable heterogeneity in clinical practice regarding the timing of extubation, the choice of surgical procedures triggering on-table extubation, the choice of anesthetic drugs and the use of regional anesthesia. More coordinated efforts are needed to implement ERAS concepts in pediatric cardiac surgery and harvest the benefits of ERAS concepts for the pediatric cardiac population.},

  abstract = {The ban on assisted suicide "intended as a recurring pursuit" was lifted by the German Federal Constitutional Court in 2020. Consequently, the German Medical Council repealed § 16 sentence 3 of the (model) professional code ("They [doctors] may not provide assistance for suicide"). Two legislative proposals to regulate assisted suicide failed in the German Bundestag in 2023. To date, medical staff lack a basis for action when dealing with patients who wish to die. The opinions, attitudes and perspectives of professional groups are important with regard to assisted suicide in order to be able to draw up practical regulations that can be implemented in everyday medical practice. The aim of this survey is to assess the knowledge about the legal situation in Germany as well as perceptions and attitudes towards assisted suicide among members of the German Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI). The study group developed a questionnaire in repeated interdisciplinary and multiprofessional discussions based on a literature review and a previous survey among younger physicians. The questionnaire consisted of questions on the legal and statutory situation of assisted suicide in Germany, personal attitudes and demographic data. It was distributed via the DGAI member newsletter using an online link. From 08/2023-01/2024, out of 25,573 reachable members, 1056 viewed the survey (view rate: 4%), 822 participated, of which 686 completed the questionnaire (completion rate: 83%). Of all participants, 99% (n = 676/686) were physicians; 56% (n = 385/686) were older than 50 years. 45% (n = 310/686) of participants stated that they were aware of the judgment on the invalidity of section 217 of the German criminal code. 86% (n = 589/686) of respondents incorrectly believed that it is prohibited in Germany to offer assisted suicide intended as a recurring pursuit and 21% (n = 142/686) of respondents falsely believed that assisted suicide is a criminal offense in Germany. 77% (n = 527/686) would prefer a new legal regulation on assisted suicide in order to achieve greater legal certainty. 55% (n = 374/686) stated that healthcare workers are the appropriate point of contact to decide on the permissibility of assisted suicide. Of all respondants, 45% (n = 305/686) have asked patients about the existence of death wishes in their professional career; 23% (n = 159/686) of respondents have never done so. 71% (n = 486/686) declined to participate in assisted suicide for patients regardless of the health condition; 65% (n = 443/686) indicated they could only envision participation in a palliative care setting. Participating members of the DGAI show a lack of knowledge regarding the current legal framework surrounding assisted suicide in Germany. They express the hope that future legal regulations will provide legal certainty in this sensitive area. The findings of this study highlight the complexity inherent in the issue of assisted suicide. Subsequent research and policy development should focus on addressing the needs and challenges faced by clinicians and patients, while fostering the establishment of clear guidelines and regulatory frameworks to ensure the provision of safe and ethically responsible care.},

  abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic contaminants with a widespread presence in diverse environmental contexts. Transformation processes of PAHs via degradation and biotransformation have parallels in humans, animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Mapping the transformation products of PAHs is therefore crucial for assessing their toxicological impact and developing effective monitoring strategies. The present research aimed to explore the PAH detoxification products formed by the marine fish Atlantic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) after single PAH treatments. Using target and suspect screening analyses on an ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (IM-QTOF MS), deprotonated compounds were identified and archived into a metabolite mass spectral library, which is systematized and presented in this work. The results offer an exclusive overview of the transformation products and their associated mass spectral features. Transformation products include hydroxy compounds, dihydrodiols, polycyclic aromatic acids, glucuronides, sulfates, glutathiones, cysteinylglycines, cysteines, and mercapturic acids. By documenting high-resolution mass spectrometry data, this comprehensive characterization provides a valuable reference point for the development of broad-spectrum analytical methods. It also addresses a critical gap in the field by presenting tentative identifications of PAH transformation products in the absence of analytical standards. Moreover, it encourages further investigation of these compounds as they have important toxicological relevance in both ecotoxicology and human research.},

Furthermore, clinicians might experience distress related to a CPR event. Specialist palliative care (sPC) integration could address these aspects but is not part of routine care. This study aimed to explore perspectives on sPC integration during and after CPR. A needs assessment for sPC, possible triggers indicating need, and implementation strategies were addressed. A multiprofessional qualitative semistructured focus group study was conducted in a German urban academic teaching hospital. Participants were clinicians (nursing staff, residents, and consultants) working in the emergency department and ICUs (internal medicine and surgical). The focus groups were recorded and subsequently transcribed. Data material was analyzed using the content-structuring content analysis according to Kuckartz. Seven focus groups with 18 participants in total were conducted online from July to November 2022. Six main categories (two to five subcategories) were identified: understanding (of palliative care and death), general CPR conditions (e.g., team, debriefing, and strains), prognosis (e.g., preexisting situation, use of extracorporeal support), next of kin (e.g., communication, presence during CPR), treatment plan (patient will and decision-making), and implementation of sPC (e.g., timing, trigger factors). Perceptions about the need for sPC to support during and after CPR depend on roles, areas of practice, and individual understanding of sPC. Although some participants perceive CPR itself as a trigger for sPC, others define, for example, pre-CPR-existing multimorbidity or complex family dynamics as possible triggers. Suggestions for implementation are multifaceted, especially communication by sPC is emphasized. Specific challenges of extracorporeal CPR need to be explored further. Overall, the focus groups show that the topic is considered relevant, and studies on outcomes are warranted.},

We also compared estrous activity between estrous events with or without conception and determined the effect of genetic merit for fertility traits on age and BW at time of first detected estrous activity event. Activity monitoring devices (Heatime, SCR-Engineers) were fitted to Holstein-Friesian heifers aged 7 to 9 mo with positive or negative genetic merit for fertility traits (POS FertBV: average +5%, n = 275; NEG FertBV: average -5%, n = 249) and activity data were collected to the end of the first breeding period (15-17 mo). An estrous event was defined as when the activity change index exceeded 19.2 activity units (AU) for ≥6 consecutive hours. In total, 2,434 estrous events were identified (POS FertBV: n = 1,454; NEG FertBV: n = 980). Estrous event duration was defined as the period when the threshold was first exceeded and when activity dropped below threshold, without another event starting within 24 h of the end of the previous event. This definition included occurrences where activity crossed the threshold multiple times in a day; these were classified as a single estrous event. A second measure, high activity duration, was defined as the total time activity exceeded the threshold. To characterize estrous activity, baseline activity was determined from the previous 7 d of activity. Peak activity and total activity (area under the curve of activity above baseline) were calculated. A fifth variable, interestrous interval, was calculated as a proxy for estrous cycle length. Total activity and peak activity were greater in POS than NEG FertBV heifers (total activity: 548 vs. 464 AU, SED = 19.6 AU; peak activity: 72 vs. 65 AU, SE of the difference [SED] = 1.5 AU). The POS FertBV group had a mean estrous event duration and high activity duration of 15.1 and 15.0 h, compared with 14.1 and 14.1 h for the NEG FertBV group (SED = 0.30 and 0.29 h, respectively). Inter-estrous interval did not differ between POS FertBV and NEG FertBV heifers (19.5 vs. 20.0 d, SED = 0.49). Estrous events associated with conception were shorter than those not associated with conception (mean ± SEM, high activity duration: 13.0 ± 0.25 h vs. 13.9 ± 0.31 h, estrous event duration: 13.1 ± 0.25 h vs. 14 ± 0.32 h) and had less total activity (408 ± 15.2 vs. 487 ± 18.2 AU). The POS FertBV heifers were more likely to have their first estrous activity event than NEG FertBV heifers by a given age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.0-1.6) or BW (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.1-1.6). The outcomes of this study provide evidence that positive genetic merit for fertility traits is associated with more overt estrous expression. Therefore, estrous expression traits may have potential to be used as earlier-in-life predictors of genetic merit for fertility.},

This article describes the current strategies regarding the application of this type of anaesthesia, focusing on three strategic tools: (i) application of pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic knowledge of propofol and the opioids, with particular attention to pharmacodynamic interactions between them; (ii) the use of state-of-the-art administration techniques; and (iii) the application of bispectral index monitoring. Together, these techniques have improved the level of control, the flexibility and the safety of anaesthetic practice.},

Midazolam is often used as a preoperative sedative in advance of a propofol-based anesthetic. In this study, we identified the influence of midazolam on the pharmacokinetics of propofol. Eight healthy male volunteers were studied on two occasions in a random crossover manner. During Session A, volunteers received propofol 1 mg/kg in 1 min followed by an infusion of 2.5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 59 min. During Session B, in addition to this propofol infusion scheme, a target-controlled infusion of midazolam (constant C(t): 125 ng/mL) was given from 15 min before the start until 6 h after termination of the propofol infusion. Arterial blood samples for blood propofol and plasma midazolam concentration analysis were taken until 6 h after termination of the propofol infusion. Nonlinear mixed-effects models examining the influence of midazolam and hemodynamic variables on propofol pharmacokinetics were constructed using Akaike criterion for model selection. In the presence of midazolam (C(blood): 224.8 +/- 41.6 ng/mL), the blood propofol concentration increased by 25.1% +/- 13.3% compared with when propofol was given as single drug. Midazolam (C(blood): 225 ng/mL) reduced propofol Cl(1) from 1.94 to 1.61 L/min, Cl(2) from 2.86 to 1.52 L/min, and Cl(3) from 0.95 to 0.73 L/min. Inclusion of mean arterial blood pressure further improved the propofol pharmacokinetic model. Midazolam reduces the metabolic and rapid and slow distribution clearances of propofol. In addition, a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure is associated with propofol pharmacokinetic alterations that increase the blood propofol concentration.},

MdPE and MdAPE did not differ between groups during the pre-adjustment period (control group: 6.3% and 16%; intervention group: 5.4% and 18%). MdPE differed in the post-adjustment period (12% vs. -0.3%), but MdAPE did not (18% vs. 15%). No difference in heart rate, MAP or BIS was found.

Hepatic RNA levels for TNF-alpha were significantly elevated on Day 1 postburn compared to saline (P < 0. 05). Hepatic protein content increased on Days 2, 5, and 7 postburn compared to saline (P < 0.05). Hepatocyte proliferation in rhGH-treated rats increased on Day 5 after burn (P < 0.05). Data indicate that rhGH alters the hepatic acute phase response by decreasing type I acute phase proteins and modulating IL-1-like cytokine expression. These changes are associated with increased hepatocyte mitosis and serum and total liver protein concentrations.},

We propose that liposome IGF-I gene transfer will accelerate wound healing in burned rats and attenuate deleterious side-effects associated with high levels of IGF-I. To test this hypothesis IGF-I gene constructs, encapsulated in liposomes, were studied for their efficacy in modulating the thermal injury response. Thirty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were given a 60% TBSA scald burn and randomly divided into three groups to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of liposomes plus the lacZ gene coding for beta-galactosidase, liposomes plus cDNA for IGF-I and beta-galactosidase or liposomes plus the rhIGF-I protein. Body weights and wound healing were measured. Muscle and liver dry/wet weights and IGF-I concentrations in serum, skin and liver were measured by radioimmunoassay. Transfection was confirmed by histochemical staining for beta-galactosidase. Rats receiving the IGF-I cDNA constructs exhibited the most rapid wound re-epithelialization and greatest increase in body weight and gastrocnemius muscle protein content (P < 0.05). Local IGF-I protein concentrations in the skin were higher when compared to liposomes containing only the lacZ gene (P < 0.05) Transfection was apparent in the cytoplasm of myofibroblasts, endothelial cells and macrophages of the granulation tissue. Liposomes containing the IGF-I gene constructs proved effective in preventing muscle protein wasting and preserving total body weight after a severe thermal injury.},

Quality of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Strong or conditional recommendations were provided according to overall level of evidence. Good practice statements were provided for recommendations with only low to very low quality of evidence. After two rounds of deliberations, the panel provided seven strong (high level of evidence, Grade 1 +/-) recommendations and six conditional (low level of evidence, Grade 2 +/-) recommendations for cardiovascular evaluation before LT. Seven recommendations were based on good practice statements because of a very low level of evidence. Agreement between panelists was reached for 100% of recommendations. Several recommendations are made to improve a candidate's cardiovascular assessment before LT.},

Relevant outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS research have not been previously defined. National consensus was sought to identify relevant long term patient outcome parameters, process outcome parameters and performance outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS care. This was a mixed methods Delphi consensus study. A list of potentially relevant outcome parameters was identified using a systematic literature review. These parameters were subsequently surveyed in a Delphi consensus study. Helicopter Emergency Medical Services physicians and relevant stakeholders were invited to participate in this Delphi survey, where they were allowed to suggest additional outcome parameters. Descriptive analysis was performed on all data sets. Forty-nine potential outcome parameters for Dutch P-HEMS care were surveyed. Of 71 invited participants, 53 (75%), 40 (56%), and 20 (28%) participated in the first, second, and third round of the Delphi study, respectively. Consensus was reached on 25 (51%) of 49 outcome parameters as being important. These consisted of seven long term patient related outcome parameters, four short term patient related outcome parameters, five process outcome parameters and nine performance outcome parameters. In conclusion, this study identified 25 outcome parameters relevant for Dutch physician staffed HEMS care. These parameters should be considered when designing future studies and should be routinely collected for each dispatch if possible.},

We developed a questionnaire survey based on the theoretical framework of Van Sluisveld et al. for classifying barriers and facilitators. The questionnaire contained 57 statements derived from (a) an instrument for measuring determinants of innovations by the Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research, (b) interviews with quality and safety policy officers and perioperative professionals, and (c) a publication of Cabana et al. The target group consisted of 232 perioperative professionals in nine hospitals. In addition to rating the statements on a five-point Likert scale (which were classified into the seven categories of the framework: factors relating to the intervention, society, implementation, organization, professional, patients, and social factors), respondents were invited to rank their three most important barriers in a separate, extra open-ended question. Ninety-five professionals (41%) completed the questionnaire. Fifteen statements (26%) were considered to be barriers, relating to social factors ( We identified a wide range of barriers that are believed to hinder the use of the perioperative safety guidelines, while an integrated information system and local data collection and feedback will also be necessary to engage perioperative teams. These barriers need to be locally prioritized and addressed by tailored implementation strategies.

In case of chronic CRPS-1, exercise therapy of the affected limb forms an important part of the physiotherapeutic program. We investigated whether muscle loading in chronic CRPS-1 patients is associated with impairments in muscle circulation of the forearm of the affected limb. Thirty patients with chronic CRPS-1 unilaterally affecting their upper limbs, and 30 age-matched and sex-matched control participants were included in this study. Local muscle blood flow and hemoglobin oxygenation were measured by near infrared spectroscopy within the muscles of the forearm at rest, after 1-minute isometric handgrip exercises, and after arterial occlusion. Main outcome parameters were: local muscle blood flow, O2 consumption (mVO2), and postischemic reoxygenation (ReOx). We found no differences in baseline muscle blood flow, mVO2, and ReOx between the affected CRPS-1, unaffected CRPS-1, and control arms. After exercise, mVO2 of the affected CRPS-1 arms was not different from the clinically unaffected CRPS-1 arms. Furthermore, in comparison with the control arms, unaffected CRPS-1 arms showed no difference in mVO2 or ReOx. Muscle loading does not seems to be related to impairments in muscle oxygen uptake in forearm muscles of upper limbs affected by chronic CRPS-1. Our results suggest that exercise therapy can be safely used in physiotherapeutic training programs for chronic CRPS-1 of the upper limb.},

In the Netherlands, a national guideline for continuous palliative sedation has been developed to contribute to the quality of palliative sedation practice. The present follow-up study investigated whether the practice of continuous sedation has changed after the introduction of this guideline. This study compared the practice of continuous sedation before and after the introduction of the guideline on December 7, 2005. A baseline measurement was performed between February 1, 2003, and May 1, 2005, with an enrollment of 492 physicians (medical specialists, general practitioners, and nursing home physicians). From January 1 to June 30, 2007, after the introduction of a national guideline for palliative sedation, a follow-up study was performed with the respondents of the baseline study. Physicians were asked to report on their last case of deep and continuous sedation in the past 12 months. This study reports the results of the follow-up study and compares them to the results of the baseline study. The response rate was 69.3% (n = 341). Of these physicians, 160 reported a last case of continuous sedation in both the baseline and the follow-up studies. Physicians reported a significant increase in patient involvement in decision making, from 72.3% to 82.2%. Pain remained the most often reported reason to start sedation, whereas exhaustion as a reason for sedation increased. The use of benzodiazepines increased from 69.9% to 90.4%. In the first and second measurements, symptom-directed treatment during sedation was applied in 56% to 58% of the cases. In the second period, there was more often an explicit decision to not give artificial hydration during sedation (78.8% vs 56.3%). Of the physicians, 34.2% were convinced that sedation shortened the life of the patient because of dehydration. After the introduction of the guideline, physicians reported that changes in palliative sedation practice conform to the recommendations of this guideline. For example, benzodiazepines were used for sedation more frequently than before and patient involvement in the decision-making process improved. Possible effects of dehydration and the large variation in symptom-directed treatment during sedation deserve careful attention.},

A systematic search was done on electronic bibliographic databases in July 2023. Randomized controlled trials of olanzapine as a prophylactic antiemetic for PONV in adults who underwent general anesthesia were included. The authors excluded non-RCTs and retracted studies. The authors set no date of publication or language limits. The outcomes were the incidence of PONV within 24 h postoperatively and the safety of olanzapine. The risk of bias was assessed according to the tool suggested by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Meta-analysis included 446 adult patients. Olanzapine reduced on average 38 % the incidence of PONV. The estimated risk ratio (95 % CI) of olanzapine versus control was 0.62 (0.42-0.90), p = 0.010, I This systematic review with meta-analysis indicated that olanzapine as a prophylactic antiemetic alone or combined with other antiemetic agents reduced the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. However, this conclusion must be presented with some degree of uncertainty due to the small number of studies included. There was a lack of any evidence to draw conclusions on side effects.},

Currently, no decision support tools cover a wide range of biopsychosocial factors, including referral letter information to help clinicians triage patients to the optimal LBP treatment. The objective of this study was to investigate the added value of including qualitative data from EHRs and referral letters to the accuracy of a quantitative DSS for patients with LBP. A retrospective study was conducted in a clinical cohort of Dutch patients with LBP. Patients filled out a baseline questionnaire about demographics, pain, disability, work status, quality of life, medication, psychosocial functioning, comorbidity, history, and duration of pain. Referral reasons and patient requests for help (patient goals) were extracted via natural language processing (NLP) and enriched in the data set. For decision support, these data were considered independent factors for triage to neurosurgery, anesthesiology, rehabilitation, or minimal intervention. Support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and multilayer perceptron models were trained for 2 conditions: with and without consideration of the referral letter content. The models' accuracies were evaluated via F1-scores, and confusion matrices were used to predict the treatment path (out of 4 paths) with and without additional referral parameters. Data from 1608 patients were evaluated. The evaluation indicated that 2 referral reasons from the referral letters (for anesthesiology and rehabilitation intervention) increased the F1-score accuracy by up to 19.5% for triaging. The confusion matrices confirmed the results. This study indicates that data enriching by adding NLP-based extraction of the content of referral letters increases the model accuracy of DSSs in suggesting optimal treatments for individual patients with LBP. Overall model accuracies were considered low and insufficient for clinical application.},

In addition to learning from retrospective analyses, prospective risk-assessment methods may help to decrease preventable events further by targeting perioperative hazards. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the methods used to identify perioperative patient safety risks prospectively, and to describe the risk areas targeted, the quality characteristics and feasibility of methods. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane databases were searched, adhering to PRISMA guidelines. All studies describing the development and results of prospective methods to identify perioperative patient safety risks were included and assessed on methodological quality. Exclusion criteria were interventional studies, studies targeting one specific issue, studies reporting on structural factors relating to fundamental hospital items, and non-original or case studies. The electronic search resulted in 16 708 publications, but only 20 were included for final analysis, describing five prospective risk-assessment methods. Direct observation was used in most studies, often in combination. Direct (16 studies) and indirect (4 studies) observations identified (potential) adverse events (P)AEs, process flow disruptions, poor protocol compliance and poor practice performance. (Modified) Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA™) (5 studies) targeted potential process flow disruption failures, and direct (P)AE surveillance (3 studies) identified (P)AEs prospectively. Questionnaires (3 studies) identified poor protocol compliance, surgical flow disturbances and patients' willingness to ask questions about their care. Overall, quality characteristics and feasibility of the methods were poorly reported. The direct (in-person) observation appears to be the primary prospective risk-assessment method that currently may best help to target perioperative hazards. This is a reliable method and covers a broad spectrum of perioperative risk areas.},

Asymptomatic hypoaesthesia, variable in extent and non-dermatomal in distribution, was present in seven patients at baseline. It appeared to be more extensive and distal with longer duration of pre-existing pain. SNB produced no consistent changes in extent and distribution of hypoaesthetic areas. Change in VNRS did not correlate with the extent of pre-block or post-block hypoaesthesia. No differences in effects were found between lidocaine and ropivacaine. Pre-block assessment of sensory function is essential to assess the net effect of SNBs. In this small study group, SNBs failed to demonstrate uniform or distinct effects on sensory function.},

Fifty-one acoustic neuromas were diagnosed and surgically removed; 36 were large tumors with extracanalicular extension and 15 were strictly intracanalicular small tumors. With routine CT (without and with contrast medium) large and enhancing lesions (36 of 51) were visualized, but small intracanalicular tumors (15 lesions) were missed. The latter were visualized by CT cisternography (seven cases) or MR (eight cases).

We performed this study to establish myotomal motor effects after L4 spinal nerve blocks by lidocaine and ropivacaine and to evaluate the relationship with pain. Therefore, 20 patients, of which 19 finished the complete protocol, with chronic lumbosacral radicular pain without neurological deficits underwent segmental nerve blocks at L4 with both lidocaine and ropivacaine. Pain intensity scores (verbal numeric rating scale; VNRS) and the maximum voluntary muscle force (MVMF; using a dynamometer expressed in newtons) of the tibialis anterior and quadriceps femoris muscles were measured on the painful side and on the control side. The median VNRS decrease was 4.0 (P < 0.00001; Wilcoxon's signed rank test), without significant differences between ropivacaine and lidocaine (Mann-Whitney U-test). A difference in effect on MVMF was found for affected versus control side (P = 0.016; Tukey test). Multiple regression revealed a significant negative correlation for change in VNRS score versus change in median MVMF (Spearman R = -0.48: P = 0.00001). This study demonstrates that in patients with unilateral chronic low back pain radiating to the leg, pain reduction induced by local anesthetic segmental nerve (L4) block is associated with increased quadriceps femoris and tibialis anterior MVMF, without differences for lidocaine and ropivacaine.},

The socioeconomic burden of LBP is very high. A minority of patients visit secondary or tertiary care because of severe and long-lasting complaints. This subgroup may account for a major part of disability and costs, yet could potentially gain most from treatment. Currently, little is known about the personal and societal burden in patients with chronic complex LBP visiting secondary/tertiary care. Baseline data were acquired through patient-reported questionnaires and health insurance claims. Primary outcomes were LBP impact (Impact Stratification, range 8-50), functioning (Pain Disability Index, PDI; 0-70), quality of life (EuroQol-5D, EQ5D; -0.33 to 1.00), work ability (Work Ability Score, WAS; 0-10), work participation, productivity costs (Productivity Cost Questionnaire), and healthcare costs 1 year before baseline. Healthcare costs were compared with matched primary and secondary care LBP samples. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied. In total, 1502 patients (age 46.3 ± 12.8 years, 57% female) were included. Impact Stratification was 35.2 ± 7.5 with severe impact (≥35) for 58% of patients. PDI was 38.2 ± 14.1, EQ5D 0.39 (interquartile range, IQR: 0.17-0.72); WAS 4.0 (IQR: 1.0-6.0) and 17% were permanently work-disabled. Mean total health care costs (&OV0556;4875, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4309-5498) were higher compared to the matched primary care sample (n = 4995) (&OV0556;2365, 95% CI: 2219-2526, P < 0.001), and similar to the matched secondary care sample (n = 4993) (&OV0556;4379, 95% CI: 4180-4590). Productivity loss was estimated at &OV0556;4315 per patient (95% CI: 3898-4688) during 6 months. In patients seeking multidisciplinary spine care, the personal and societal impact of LBP is very high. Specifically, quality of life and work ability are poor and health care costs are twice as high compared to patients seeking primary LBP care. 3.},

We explored the number, nature and causes of voluntarily reported perioperative incidents in order to highlight the areas where further efforts are required to improve patient safety. Data from the Hospital Incident Management System (HIMS), entered in the period from July 2009 to July 2012, were analyzed in a Dutch university hospital. Employees in the perioperatve field filled out a semi-structured digital form of the reporting system. The risk classification of the reported adverse events and 'near misses' was based on the estimated patient consequences and the risk of recurrence, according to national guidelines. Predefined reported incident causes were categorized as human, organizational, technical and patient related. In total, 2,563 incidents (1,300 adverse events and 1,263 'near-miss' events) were reported during 67,360 operations. Reporters were anesthesia, operating room and recovery nurses (37%), ward nurses (31%), physicians (17%), administrative personnel (5%), others (6%) and unmentioned (3%). A total of 414 (16%) adverse events had patient consequences (which affected 0,6% of all surgery patients), estimated as catastrophic in 2, very serious in 34, serious in 105, and marginally serious in 273 cases. Shortcomings in communication was the most frequent reported type of incidents. Non-compliance with Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs: instructions, regulations, protocols and guidelines) was reported with 877 (34%) of incident reports. In total, 1,194 (27%) voluntarily reported causes were SOP-related, mainly human-based (79%) and partially organization-based (21%). SOP-related incidents were not associated with more patient consequences than other voluntarily reported incidents. Furthermore 'mistake or forgotten' (15%) and 'communication problems' (11%) were frequently reported causes of incidents. The analysis of voluntarily reported perioperative incidents identified an association between perioperative patient safety problems and human failure, such as SOP non-compliance, mistakes, forgetting, and shortcomings in communication. The data suggest that professionals themselves indicate that SOP compliance in combination with other human failures provide room for improvement.},

The aim of this study is to determine the LM-sonoanatomy by comparing high-resolution reconstructions from a 3-D digital spine compared to standard LM-ultrasonography. An observational study was carried out. From three deeply frozen human tissue blocks of the lumbosacral spine, a large series of consecutive photographs at 78 μm interval were acquired and reformatted into 3-D blocks. This enabled the reconstruction of (semi-)oblique cross-sections that could match US-images obtained from a healthy volunteer. Transverse and oblique short-axis views were compared from the most caudal insertion of LM to L1. Based on the anatomical reconstructions, we could distinguish the LM from the adjacent erector spinae (ES) in the standard US imaging of the lower spine. At the lumbosacral junction, LM is the only dorsal muscle facing the surface. From L5 upwards, the ES progresses from lateral to medial. A clear distinction between deep and superficial LM could not be discerned. We were only able to identify five separate bands between every lumbar spinous processes and the dorsal part of the sacrum in the caudal anatomical cross-sections, but not in the standard US images. The detailed cross-sectional LM-sonoanatomy and reconstructions facilitate the interpretations of standard LM US-imaging, the position of the separate LM-bands, the details of deep interspinal muscles, and demarcation of the LM versus the ES. Guidelines for electrode positioning in EMG studies should be refined to establish reliable and verifiable findings. For clinical practice, this study can serve as a guide for a better characterisation of LM compared to ES and for a more reliable placement of US-probe in biofeedback.},

The aim of this study was to identify treatment response trajectories in patients with low back pain (LBP) during and after multidisciplinary care in a tertiary spine center, and to examine baseline patient characteristics that can distinguish trajectories. Treatment response is often heterogeneous between patients with LBP. Knowledge on key characteristics that are associated with courses of disability could identify patients at risk for less favorable outcome. This knowledge will help improve shared decision-making. Adult patients with LBP completed questionnaires on disability (Pain Disability Index) and LBP impact (Impact Stratification of the National Institutes of Health minimal dataset) at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months' follow-up. Latent class analyses were applied to identify trajectories of disability and LBP impact. Baseline sociodemographic and clinical patient characteristics were compared between trajectory subgroups. Follow-up was available for 996 patients on disability and 707 patients on LBP impact. Six trajectories were identified for both outcome measures. Three disability trajectories remained stable at distinct levels of severity (68% of patients) and three trajectories showed patterns of recovery (32%). For LBP impact there was one stable trajectory (17%), two slightly improving (59%), two recovering (15%), and one with a pattern of recovery and relapse (15%). Significant differences between trajectories were observed for almost all baseline patient characteristics. On average, patients show moderate improvements in disability and LBP impact 2 years after visiting a multidisciplinary tertiary spine center. However, latent class analyses revealed that most patients belong to subgroups experiencing stable levels of disability and LBP impact. Differences in baseline patient characteristics were mostly associated with baseline levels of functioning, instead of (un)favorable outcome during follow-up. 2.},

The relative risk of conversion with a 8 mg dose or lower is 4.88 (95% CI 1.41 - 16.85).

Database search resulted in 34 included studies. Forty different definition references were used to define HACS. This review uncovered twenty quantitative methods to assess HACS, including four questionnaires and sixteen quantitative sensory testing measures. The prevalence of HACS in patients with chronic low back pain was estimated in three studies. The current systematic review highlights that multiple definitions, assessment methods, and prevalence estimates are stated in the literature regarding HACS in patients with chronic low back pain. Most of the assessment methods of HACS are not validated but have been tested for reliability and repeatability. Given the lack of a gold standard to assess HACS, an initial grading system is proposed to standardize clinical and research assessments of HACS in patients with a chronic low back.},

We performed a multiply-blinded randomised controlled trial in patients aged 18-60 years with cancer at high risk of postoperative nausea or vomiting (three or four risk factors according to the Apfel criteria) plus a previous history of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Patients were allocated at random to receive 10 mg olanzapine or placebo orally 1 h before surgery in addition to a two-drug regimen (dexamethasone and ondansetron) and propofol anaesthesia to prevent postoperative nausea or vomiting. The primary outcome was the incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting in the first 24 h after surgery. In total, 100 patients were enrolled; 47 in the olanzapine group and 49 in the control group completed the study. The baseline characteristics of the groups were similar. The incidence of postoperative nausea or vomiting in the first 24 h after surgery was lower in the olanzapine group (12/47, 26%) than in the control group (31/49, 63%) (p = 0.008, RR 0.40 (95%CI 0.21-0.79)). Adding pre-operative oral olanzapine to intra-operative dexamethasone and ondansetron was highly effective in reducing the risk of postoperative nausea or vomiting in the first 24 hours after surgery in patients with a previous history of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and at least three Apfel risk factors for postoperative nausea or vomiting.},

The aims of this systematic review were to identify non-invasive objective markers of HACS and the instruments to assess these markers in patients with fibromyalgia (FM). A systematic review was conducted with the following inclusion criteria: (1) adults, (2) diagnosed with FM, and (3) markers and instruments for HACS had to be non-invasive. Data were subsequently extracted, and studies were assessed for risk of bias using the quality assessment tools developed by the National Institute of Health. 78 studies (n= 5234 participants) were included and the findings were categorized in markers identified to assess peripheral and central manifestations of HACS. The identified markers for peripheral manifestations of HACS, with at least moderate evidence, were pain after-sensation decline rates, mechanical pain thresholds, pressure pain threshold, sound 'pressure' pain threshold, cutaneous silent period, slowly repeated evoked pain sensitization and nociceptive flexion reflex threshold. The identified markers for central manifestations of HACS were efficacy of conditioned pain modulation with pressure pain conditioning and brain perfusion analysis. Instruments to assess these markers are: pin-prick stimulators, cuff-algometry, repetitive pressure stimulation using a pressure algometer, sound, electrodes and neuroimaging techniques. This review provides an overview of non-invasive markers and instruments for the assessment of HACS in patients with FM. Implementing these findings into clinical settings may help to identify HACS in patients with FM.},

MRI is far more reliable in the radiological diagnosis of CPA and IAC lesions.},

The objective was to study the safety and effect of a combination of music and abdominally administered low-frequency vibrations on pain intensity in elderly patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. This trial was an international multicenter, randomized controlled pilot study. Patients at age ≥ 65 years with musculoskeletal pain for ≥ 3 months and a daily pain score ≥ 4 out of 10 were recruited at three centers. They were randomized to receive either a combination of music and low-frequency (20-100 Hz) vibrations administered to the abdomen, or a combination with the same music but with higher frequency (200-300 Hz) vibrations administered to the abdomen. Low-frequency vibrations were expected to result in pain reduction measured with a numeric pain rating scale (NRS). Patients in both groups received eight treatments of the music combined with the vibrations in three weeks. Primary outcomes were safety (Serious Adverse Events) and pain intensity measured at baseline, after the last treatment and at six weeks follow-up. Multilevel linear model analyses were performed to study group and time effects. A total of 45 patients were analyzed according to intention-to-treat principle. After 344 treatments, 1 Adverse Event was found related to the intervention, while 13 Adverse Events were possibly related. A multilevel linear model showed that the interaction effect of group by time did not predict pain intensity (F[1, 45.93] = 0.002, p = 0.97) when comparing pain intensity at baseline, after the last treatment and at follow-up. The combination of music and abdominally administered vibrations was found to be safe and well tolerated by the elderly patients. However, over time, neither the low-frequency treatment group nor the high-frequency treatment group provided clinically meaningful pain relief. There is no evidence that the low-frequency treatment elicited vagal nerve stimulation. The trial was prospectively registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR: NL7606) on 21-03-2019.},

To evaluate CBM use among EB patients, including CBM types, effects on symptoms (e.g., pain and pruritus), disease process (e.g., blistering, wounds, and inflammation), well-being (e.g., sleep, appetite) and concomitant medications. English-speaking EB patients or caregivers completed an online international, anonymous, cross-sectional survey regarding CBM use. Respondents reported the types of CBMs, subsequent effects including perceived EB symptom alteration, changes in medication use, and side effects. Seventy-one EB patients from five continents reported using or having used CBMs to treat their EB. Missing question responses ranged between 0 (0%) and 33 (46%). Most used more than one CBM preparation (mean: 2.4 ± 1.5) and route of administration (mean: 2.1 ± 1.1). Topical and ingested were the most common routes. Pain and pruritus were reported retrospectively to decrease by 3 points (scale: 0-10; p < 0.001 for both) after CBM use. Most reported that CBM use improved their overall EB symptoms (95%), pain (94%), pruritus (91%) and wound healing (81%). Most participants (79%) reported decreased use of pain medications. The most common side-effect was dry mouth (44%). CBMs improve the perception of pain, pruritus, wound healing, and well-being in EB patients and reduced concomitant medication use. Nevertheless, a direct relation between the use of CBMs and reduction of the above-mentioned symptoms cannot be proven by these data. Therefore, future controlled studies using pharmaceutically standardised CBM preparations in EB are warranted to delineate the risks and benefits of CBMs.},

  abstract = {Selective spinal nerve infiltration blocks are used diagnostically in patients with chronic low back pain radiating into the leg. Generally, a segmental nerve block is considered successful if the pain is reduced substantially. Hypesthesia and elicited paresthesias coinciding with the presumed segmental level are used as controls. The interpretation depends on a standard dermatomal map. However, it is not clear if this interpretation is reliable enough, because standard dermatomal maps do not show the overlap of neighboring dermatomes. The goal of the present study is to establish if dissimilarities exist between areas of hypesthesia, spontaneous pain reported by the patient, pain reduction by local anesthetics, and paresthesias elicited by sensory electrostimulation. A secondary goal is to determine to what extent the interpretation is improved when the overlaps of neighboring dermatomes are taken into account. Patients suffering from chronic low back pain with pain radiating into the leg underwent lumbosacral segmental nerve root blocks at subsequent levels on separate days. Lidocaine (2%, 0.5 mL) mixed with radiopaque fluid (0.25 mL) was injected after verifying the target location using sensory and motor electrostimulation. Sensory changes (pinprick method), paresthesias (reported by the patient), and pain reduction (Numeric Rating Scale) were reported. Hypesthesia and paresthesias were registered in a standard dermatomal map and in an adapted map which included overlap of neighboring dermatomes. The relationships between spinal level of injection, extent of hypesthesia, location of paresthesias, and corresponding dermatome were assessed quantitatively. Comparison of the results between both dermatomal maps was done by paired t-tests. After inclusion, data were processed for 40 segmental nerve blocks (L2-S1) performed in 29 patients. Pain reduction was achieved in 43%. Hypesthetic areas showed a large variability in size and location, and also in comparison to paresthesias. Mean hypesthetic area amounted 2.7 +/- 1.4 (+/- SD: range, 0 to 6; standard map) and 3.6 +/- 1.8 (0 to 6; adapted map; P <.001) dermatomes. In these cases, hypesthesia in the corresponding dermatome was found in 80% (standard map) and 88% of the cases (adapted map, not significant). Paresthesias occurring in the corresponding dermatome were found in 80% (standard map) compared with 98% (adapted map, P <.001). In 85% (standard map) and 88% (adapted map), spontaneous pain was present in the dermatome corresponding to the level of local anesthetic injection. In 55% (standard map) versus 75% (adapted map, P <.005), a combination of spontaneous pain, hypesthesia, and paresthesias was found in the corresponding dermatome. Hypesthetic areas determined after lumbosacral segmental nerve blocks show a large variability in size and location compared with elicited paresthesias. Confirmation of an adequately performed segmental nerve block, determined by coexistence of hypesthesia, elicited paresthesias and pain in the presumed dermatome, is more reliable when the overlap of neighboring dermatomes is taken into account.},

Because of her age and cardiac and pulmonary co-existing diseases we decided to provide adequate regional anesthesia by continuous spinal anesthesia. Fragmented doses of isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% were administered through a system consisting of a spinal catheter connected to an antimicrobial filter. After an uneventful surgical procedure, prior to removal of the catheter, this system was flushed with 10 mL of normal saline in order to try to prevent post-dural-puncture headache. After arrival at the postanesthesia care unit and fifteen minutes after removal of the catheter the patient suffered an unexpected high thoracic sensory blockade and hypotension requiring treatment. The continuous spinal anesthesia technique can be used in selected cases to be able to administer local anesthetic agents in a slow and controlled manner to reach the desired effect. The risk of post-dural-puncture headache using this technique in elderly patients is very low and therefore precludes the need to try to prevent it. We have described a potentially dangerous complication of flushing a bupivacaine-filled system into the spinal canal of an elderly patient resulting in an undesirable high sensory blockade.},

Analyses were performed for all participants together and for each sex separately. Regression analyses were performed on patients with chronic pain with and without central sensitivity syndromes. Based on 1730 patients and 250 healthy controls, cutoff values for the CSI for the total group were established at 30 points: women: 33 points; men: 25 points. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify possible predictors for the CSI score in 2890 patients with chronic pain. The CSI score is associated with all independent factors and has a low association with pain severity in women and a low association with pain severity, age, and body mass index in men. The newly established CSI cutoff values are lower than in previous studies and different per sex, which might be of clinical relevance in daily practice and importance in research.},

Patients' pain was classified by two independent (pain-)physicians as the gold standard. The analysis was initially performed on the outcomes of those patients (n = 228 out of 291) in whom both physicians agreed in their pain classification. Compared to the gold standard the DN4 had a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 76%. The DN4-symptoms (seven interview items) solely resulted in a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 67%. For the DN4-signs (three examination items) it was respectively 75% and 75%. In conclusion, because it seems that the DN4 helps to identify a neuropathic pain component in a consecutive population of patients with chronic pain in a moderate way, a comprehensive (physical-) examination by the physician is still obligate.},

Thereafter the patient is assessed by a multidisciplinary team (psychologist, physical therapist, anesthesiologist-pain specialist, physiatrist and vascular surgeon). During a multidisciplinary meeting professionals summarize their assessment. Pros and cons of an amputation are discussed, taking into account level of amputation and expectations about post amputation functioning of patient and team. Based on assessments and discussion a consensus based decision is formulated and the patient is informed. If it is decided that an amputation is to be performed, the amputation will follow shortly. If it is decided not to amputate, the decision is extensively explained to the patient. Incidence of patients suffering from therapy resistant CRPS-I referred for amputation is low and because referred patients are strongly in favor of an amputation, a randomized controlled trial will be difficult to perform. Hence level of evidence in favor or against an amputation will remain low. We therefore report our decision making process to facilitate discussion about this difficult and delicate matter.},

A Self-assessment Instrument for Perioperative Patient Safety (SIPPS) monitoring and benchmarking compliance to safety standards was validated in a multicentre pilot study. A preliminary questionnaire, based on the Dutch perioperative patient safety guidelines and covering international patient safety goals, was evaluated in a first digital RAND Delphi round. The results were used to optimize the questionnaire and design the SIPPS. For measurement and benchmarking purposes, SIPPS was categorized into seven main patient safety domains concerning all care episode phases of the perioperative trajectory. After consensus was reached in a face-to-face Delphi round, SIPPS was pilot-tested in five hospitals for five characteristics: measurability, applicability, improvement potential, discriminatory capacity and feasibility. The results of the first Delphi round showed moderate feasibility for the preliminary questionnaire (81·6 per cent). The pilot test showed good measurability for SIPPS: 99·8 per cent of requested information was assessable. Some 99·9 per cent of SIPPS questions were applicable to the selected respondents. With SIPPS, room for improvement in perioperative patient safety compliance was demonstrated for all hospitals, concerning all safety domains and all care episode phases of the perioperative trajectory (compliance 76·1 per cent). SIPPS showed mixed results for discriminatory capacity. SIPPS showed good feasibility for all items (range 91·9-95·7 per cent). A self-assessment instrument for measuring perioperative patient safety (SIPPS) compliance meeting international standards was validated. With SIPPS, improvement areas for perioperative patient safety and best practices across hospitals could be identified.},

Adequate symptom alleviation is not often achieved using conventional pharmacologic interventions. Finding novel approaches to pain care in EB is imperative to improve the quality of life of patients living with EB. There are several anecdotal reports on the use of cannabinoid-based medicines (CBMs) by EB patients to reduce the burden of symptoms. However, controlled clinical investigations assessing these reported effects are lacking. As the pain quality "unpleasantness" delineates EB pain, we hypothesize the modulation of affective pain processing in the brain by way of intervention with CBMs comprising the cannabinoids Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol-objectified by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The C4EB study is an investigator-initiated, single-centre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover trial. Adult patients with the diagnosis epidermolysis bullosa, reporting chronic pain will be eligible to participate. Following baseline measurements, participants will be randomized to receive the sublingually administered interventions placebo and Transvamix® in forward or reversed orders, each for two weeks and separated by a washout. The primary outcome is the difference in numeric rating scale pain scores between grouped interventions, using affective descriptors within the Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2. Secondary outcomes include pain self-efficacy, concomitant analgesic medication-use and adverse events. Additionally, fMRI will be employed to assess brain connectivity related to neuroanatomic pain circuits at baseline, placebo and Transvamix® interventions.

In a prospective, observer-blind study, 60 patients scheduled for thoracic surgery received a thoracic epidural catheter for 3 days. The patients were randomly assigned by lot to one of two groups: a low-volume (LV) group (bupivacaine 0.75% with sufentanil 4 micrograms/mL, 1.0-1.3 mL/h), or a high-volume (HV) group (bupivacaine 0.125% with sufentanil 0.7 microgram/mL, 6-8 mL/h). On the first postoperative day significantly more patients in the LV group needed one or more epidural bolus injections because they experienced pain at rest (P < 0.05). On the second and third postoperative days there were no differences in bolus injections. Significantly more patients in the HV group did not require an extra epidural bolus injection (P < 0.05). There were no differences in the number of patients experiencing pain at exercise or in the incidence of side effects. A difference was found between both groups in the mean preoperative PaCO2 value (P < 0.05) and also for the PaCO2 values on Day 1 versus the preoperative values within the group (P < 0.05). On the first postoperative day the analgesic effects of a sufentanil/bupivacaine mixture at a high thoracic epidural level can be improved when injected at a continuous high-volume rate compared with a dose-equivalent continuous low-volume rate. This is true for pain at rest; for pain at exercise, there were no differences.},

  abstract = {To improve perioperative patient safety, hospitals are implementing evidence-based perioperative safety guidelines. To facilitate this process, it is important to provide insight into current practice. For this purpose, we aimed to develop patient safety indicators. The RAND-modified Delphi method was used to develop a set of patient safety indicators based on the perioperative guidelines. First, a core group of experts systematically selected recommendations from the guidelines. Then, an expert panel of representative professionals appraised the recommendations against safety criteria, prioritized them and reached consensus about 11 patient safety indicators. Measurability, applicability, improvement potential (based on current practice) and discriminatory capacity of each indicator were pilot tested in eight hospitals. Seven structure, two process and two outcome indicators were developed covering the entire perioperative care process. Most indicators showed good applicability (N=11), improvement potential (N=6) and discriminatory capacity (N=7). Four indicators were difficult to measure. Improvement opportunities concerned the use of perioperative stops, timely administration of antibiotics, availability of protocols on perioperative anticoagulants and on prospective risk analysis of medical equipment, presence of a surveillance system for postoperative wound infections, and a morbidity and mortality registration. Using a systematic, stepwise method 11 patient safety indicators were developed for internal assessment, monitoring and improvement of the perioperative care process. There was large variation in guideline adherence between and within hospitals, identifying opportunities for improvement in the quality of perioperative care.},

  abstract = {This study is initiated to evaluate the effects, costs, and feasibility at the hospital and patient level of an evidence-based strategy to improve the use of Dutch perioperative safety guidelines. Based on current knowledge, expert opinions and expertise of the project team, a multifaceted implementation strategy has been developed. This is a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial including nine representative hospitals across The Netherlands. Hospitals are stratified into three groups according to hospital type and geographical location and randomized in terms of the period for receipt of the intervention. All adult surgical patients meeting the inclusion criteria are assessed for patient outcomes. The implementation strategy includes education, audit and feedback, organizational interventions (e.g., local embedding of the guidelines), team-directed interventions (e.g., multi-professional team training), reminders, as well as patient-mediated interventions (e.g., patient safety cards). To tailor the implementation activities, we developed a questionnaire to identify barriers for effective guideline adherence, based on (a) a theoretical framework for classifying barriers and facilitators, (b) an instrument for measuring determinants of innovations, and (c) 19 semi-structured interviews with perioperative key professionals. Primary outcome is guideline adherence measured at the hospital (i.e., cluster) and patient levels by a set of perioperative Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs), which was developed parallel to the perioperative guidelines. Secondary outcomes at the patient level are in-hospital complications, postoperative wound infections and mortality, length of hospital stay, and unscheduled transfer to the intensive care unit, non-elective readmission to the hospital and unplanned reoperation, all within 30 days after the initial surgery. Also, patient safety culture and team climate will be studied as potential determinants. Finally, a process evaluation is conducted to identify the compliance with the implementation strategy, as well as an economic evaluation to assess the costs. Data sources are registered clinical data and surveys. There is no form of blinding. The perioperative setting is an unexplored area with respect to implementation issues. This study is expected to yield important new evidence about the effects of a multifaceted approach on guideline adherence in the perioperative care setting. Dutch trial registry: NTR3568.},

Secondary outcomes were the experiences of surgical teams with perioperative briefing and debriefing, measured with a structured questionnaire, and the duration of the briefings, measured by an independent observer. Two and a half years after the introduction of perioperative briefing and debriefing, the team climate increased statistically significant (p≤0.05). Members of the five surgical teams strongly agreed with the positive influence of perioperative briefing and debriefing on clear agreements and reminding one another of the agreements of the day. They perceived a higher efficiency of the surgical programme with more operations starting on time and less unexpectedly long operation time. The perioperative briefing took less than 4 min to conduct. Perioperative briefing and debriefing improved the team climate of surgical teams and the efficiency of their work within the operating theatre with acceptable duration per briefing. Surgical teams with alternating team compositions have the most benefit of briefing and debriefing.},

Longitudinal validity of the total minimal dataset and the subscale Impact Stratification are unknown. Total outcome scores on the NIH minimal dataset, Dutch Language Version, were calculated ranging from 0 to 100 points with higher scores representing worse functioning. Responsiveness and MCIC were determined with an anchor-based method, calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) and by determining the optimal cut-off point. Smallest detectable change (SDC) was calculated as a parameter of measurement error. In total 223 patients with CLBP were included. Mean total score on the NIH minimal dataset was 44 ± 14 points at baseline. The total outcome score was responsive to change with an AUC of 0.84. MCIC was 14 points with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity 82%, and SDC was 23 points. Mean total score on Impact Stratification (scale 8-50) was 34.4 ± 7.4 points at baseline, with an AUC of 0.91, an MCIC of 7.5 with a sensitivity 96% of and specificity of 78%, and an SDC of 14 points. The longitudinal validity of the NIH minimal dataset is adequate. An improvement of 14 points in total outcome score and 7.5 points in Impact Stratification can be interpreted as clinically important in individual patients. However, MCIC depends on baseline values and the method that is chosen to determine the optimal cut-off point. Furthermore, measurement error is larger than the MCIC. This means that individual change scores should be interpreted with caution. 2.},

Inclusion criteria were: participants between 18 and 65 years old with non-specific sub-acute or chronic LBP, minimum average follow-up of > 2 years, and studies had to report at least one of the following outcome measures: disability, quality of life, work participation, or health care utilization. Methodological quality was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment. Data were extracted, tabulated, and reported thematically. Ninety studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies examined invasive treatments (72%), conservative (21%), or a comparison of both (7%). No natural cohorts were included. Methodological quality was weak (16% of studies), moderate (63%), or strong (21%) and generally improved after 2010. Disability (92%) and pain (86%) outcomes were most commonly reported, followed by work (25%), quality of life (15%), and health care utilization (4%). Most studies reported significant improvement at long-term follow-up (median 51 months, range 26 months-18 years). Only 10 (11%) studies took more than one measurement > 2 year after baseline. Patients with persistent non-specific LBP seem to experience improvement in pain, disability and quality of life years after seeking treatment. However, it remains unclear what factors might have influenced these improvements, and whether they are treatment-related. Studies varied greatly in design, patient population, and methods of data collection. There is still little insight into the long-term natural course of LBP. Additionally, few studies perform repeated measurements during long-term follow-up or report on patient-centered outcomes other than pain or disability.},

Previous studies indicate preoperative anxiety as a risk factor for developing CPSP, yet no high-quality review exists. This study aims to systematically review the relationship between increased preoperative anxiety and the incidence of new CPSP. Four databases were used to identify relevant studies for a systematic review and meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria included adult patients undergoing surgical procedures under general anaesthesia, measuring preoperative anxiety with validated tools, and postoperative pain at least 3 months after surgery. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and a risk of bias analysis was performed. Of the 233 studies retrieved, 26 studies were included in the systematic review. Following risk of bias analysis, 23 papers were included in the meta-analysis. A correlation was found between preoperative anxiety and CPSP, with a standardised mean difference of 0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.20-0.41). High heterogeneity was observed, which was attributed to several possible confounding factors. Subgroup analysis did not alter this outcome. When translating the outcome to a relevant scale, we observed an increase in numeric rating scale pain of 0.34 for patients experiencing preoperative anxiety. There is moderate-quality evidence indicating a positive association between preoperative anxiety and CPSP, where an increase in preoperative anxiety correlates with an increased incidence of CPSP. More research is needed to identify specific patients that would benefit from treating preoperative anxiety and thus potentially preventing CPSP. PROSPERO (CRD42024513479).},

Scoping review of studies on LM morphology including major anatomy atlases. All relevant studies were searched in PubMed (Medline) and EMBASE until June 2019. Anatomy atlases were retrieved from multiple university libraries and online. All studies and atlases were screened for the following LM parameters: location, imaging methods, spine levels, muscle trajectory, muscle thickness, cross-sectional area, and diameter. The quality of the studies and atlases was also assessed using a five-item evaluation system. In all, 303 studies and 19 anatomy atlases were included in this review. In most studies, LM morphology was determined by MRI, ultrasound imaging, or drawings - particularly for levels L4-S1. In 153 studies, LM is described as a superficial muscle only, in 72 studies as a deep muscle only, and in 35 studies as both superficial and deep. Anatomy atlases predominantly depict LM as a deep muscle covered by the erector spinae and thoracolumbar fascia. About 42% of the studies had high quality scores, with 39% having moderate scores and 19% having low scores. The quality of figures in anatomy atlases was ranked as high in one atlas, moderate in 15 atlases, and low in 3 atlases. Anatomical studies of LM exhibit inconsistent findings, describing its location as superficial (50%), deep (25%), or both (12%). This is in sharp contrast to anatomy atlases, which depict LM predominantly as deep muscle. Within the limitations of the self-developed quality-assessment tool, high-quality scores were identified in a majority of studies (42%), but in only one anatomy atlas. We identified a lack of standardization in the depiction and description of LM morphology. This could affect the precise understanding of its role in background and therapy in LBP patients. Standardization of research methodology on LM morphology is recommended. Anatomy atlases should be updated on LM morphology.},

After screening 3105 studies, 26 studies were identified. Nine of these 26 studies showed statistically significant higher mortality rates for patients from minority ethnic groups. Meta-analysis demonstrated a greater risk of mortality for these patients compared with patients from the Caucasian majority in studies performed both in North America (risk ratio 1·22, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·05 to 1·42) and outside (risk ratio 2·25, 1·40 to 3·62). For patients from minority groups, the length of hospital or intensive care unit stay was significantly longer in five studies, and complication rates were significantly higher in ten. Methods used to identify patient ethnicity were not described in 14 studies. Patients from minority ethnic groups, in North America and elsewhere, have an increased risk of perioperative death and complications. More insight is needed into the causes of ethnic disparities to pursue safer perioperative care for patients of minority ethnicity.},

Pain (absence or presence of neuro-pathic pain) was assessed independently by two physicians and compared with BSE (measurements of touch [finger, brush], heat, cold, pricking [safety pin, von Frey hair], and vibration). The NASQ paradigm (pressure algometry, electrical pain thresholds, and conditioned pain modulation) was assessed in 58 patients to generate new insights. BSE revealed a low association of differences between patients with either absent or present NePC: heat, cold, and pricking sensations with a von Frey hair were statistically significantly less common in patients with present NePC. NASQ did not reveal any differences between patients with and without an NePC. Currently, a standardized BSE appears to be more useful than the NASQ paradigm when distinguishing between patients with and without an NePC.},

The aim of this study was to examine changes in health care costs after multidisciplinary spine care in patients with complex chronic back pain (CBP), to analyze the predictive value of patient and disease characteristics on health care costs, and to study the potential impact of biases concerning the use of real world data. Due to high direct and indirect societal costs of back pain there is a need for interventions that can assist in reducing the economic burden on patients and society. All patients referred to a university-based spine center insured at a major health care insurer in the Netherlands were invited. Personal and disease-related data were collected at baseline. Health care costs were retrieved from the health care insurer from 2 years before to 2 years after intervention. Repeated measures analysis of variances were calculated to study changes in health care costs after intervention. Multivariable regression analyses and cluster robust fixed effect models were applied to predict characteristics on health care costs. To study regression to the mean, a fixed effect model was calculated comparing 2 years before and 2 years post-intervention. In total 428,158 declarations during 4.6 years were filed by 997 participants (128,666 considered CBP-related). CBP-related costs significantly increased during the intervention period and reduced 2 years after the intervention. Total health care costs kept rising. The intervention was associated with a 21% to 34% (P < 0.01) reduction in costs depending on the model used. Reduction in costs was related to being male and lower body mass index. This study suggests that reduction in CBP-related health care utilization in patients with complex CBP can be achieved after a multidisciplinary spine intervention. The results are robust to controlling for background characteristics and are unlikely to be fully driven by regression to the mean. 4.},

It has been suggested that patients treated for benign indications may report higher postoperative pain, though supporting evidence is limited. To evaluate which factors are associated with acute postoperative pain severity following TORS. A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in patients undergoing TORS. Maximum postoperative pain scores (numerical rating scale, NRS 0-10) were recorded for postoperative day (POD) 1,2,3. Clinically well-controlled pain was defined as NRS < 3. Variables including surgical indication (benign or malignant), gender, age, BMI, analgesic use, chronic pain and antidepressant use were analysed. Univariable and multivariable regression analysis were performed for NRS ≥ 3. Of the 119 cases, the mean maximum POD1 pain score was 2.7 (SD 1.89). Univariable analysis showed higher POD1 were associated with benign disease, chronic pain, pain relief, female gender and age. On multivariable regression analysis, only female gender was significantly associated with NRS ≥3. Female gender was found to be the only independent predictor of higher postoperative pain, other factors, including surgical indication were not.},

The tool enables monitoring and benchmarking perioperative safety performance across departments and hospitals, covering international patient safety goals. Nineteen perioperative patient safety observation topics were selected from Dutch perioperative patient safety guidelines, which also cover international patient safety goals. All items that measured these selected topics were then extracted from available local observation checklists of the participating hospitals. Experts individually prioritized the best measurement items per topic in an initial written Delphi round. The second (face to face) Delphi round resulted in consensus on the content of SPOT, after which the measurable elements (MEs) per topic were defined. Finally, the tool was piloted in eight hospitals for measurability, applicability, improvement potential, discriminatory capacity and feasibility. The pilot test showed good measurability for all 19 patient safety topics (range of 8-291 MEs among topics), with good applicability (median 97 (range 11·8-100) per cent). The overall improvement potential appeared to be good (median 89 (range 72·5-100) per cent), and at topic level the tool showed good discriminatory capacity (variation 27·5 per cent, range in compliance 72·5-100 per cent). Overall scores showed relatively little variation between the participating hospitals (variation 13 per cent, range in compliance 83-96 per cent). All eight auditors considered SPOT a straightforward and easy-to-use tracer tool. A comprehensive tool to measure safety of care was developed and validated using a systematic, stepwise method, enabling hospitals to monitor, benchmark and improve perioperative safety performance.},

Epidural spread may lead to false interpretation, affecting clinical decision making. Systematic fluoroscopic analysis of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle tip location has not been published to date. Study aims include assessment of epidural local anesthetic spread and its relationship to needle position during fluoroscopy-assisted blocks. Patients scheduled for L4, L5, and S1 blocks were included in this prospective observational study. Under fluoroscopy and electrostimulation, they received 0.5 mL of a mixture containing lidocaine 5 mg and iohexol 75 mg. X-rays with needle tip and contrast were scored for no epidural spread (grade 0), local spread epidurally (grade 1), or to adjacent nerve roots (grade 2). Sixty-five patients were analyzed for epidural spread, 62 for needle position. Grade 1 epidural spread occurred in 47% of L4 and 28% of L5 blocks and grade 2 spread in 3 blocks (5%; L5 n = 1, S1 n = 2). For lumbar blocks, the needle was most frequently found in the lateral upper half of the intervertebral foramen. Epidural spread occurred more frequently with medial needle positions (P = .06). The findings suggest (P = .06) that the risk of grade 1 and 2 lumbar epidural spread, which results in decreased SNRB selectivity, is greater with medial needle positions in the intervertebral foramen. The variability in anatomic position of the dorsal root ganglion necessitates electrostimulation to guide SNRB in addition to fluoroscopy.},

Patients with CLBP have limited functioning and participation. Theoretically, physical functioning in patients with CLBP can plausibly be linked to CS; however, evidence to explain such association is scarce. Moreover, there is no gold standard for CS diagnosis. The objectives of the study are: (1) to analyse the association between instruments assessing reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS; (2) to analyse whether reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS are associated with functioning measurement outcomes; and (3) to analyse whether changes (between baseline and discharge) in reference symptoms and signs attributed to CS are related to changes in each of the functioning measurement outcomes. A cross-sectional and longitudinal observational study is performed with measurements taken at baseline and discharge of an interdisciplinary rehabilitation programme. A sample size of 110 adult patients with CLBP has been calculated for the study. CS measurements are: Central Sensitisation Inventory, quantitative sensory testing and heart rate variability. Functioning measurements are: lifting capacity, maximal aerobic capacity, accelerometry and reported functioning. Statistical analyses to be performed are: (1) correlation between CS measurements, (2) multiple regression between functioning (dependent variable) and CS measurements (independent variable), and (3) multiple regression between changes in scores of functioning (dependent variable) and CS measurements (independent variable), and corrected for sex and age. The study obtained the clearance to its implementation from the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen in July 2017. The results will be disseminated through scientific publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at relevant conferences, and reports to stakeholders. NTR7167/NL6980.},

A multifaceted implementation programme (IMPlementatie Richtlijnen Operatieve VEiligheid [IMPROVE]) has been developed to support hospitals in applying these guidelines. This study evaluated the effectiveness of IMPROVE on guideline adherence and the association between guideline adherence and patient safety. Nine hospitals participated in this unblinded, superiority, stepped-wedge, cluster RCT in patients with major noncardiac surgery (mortality risk ≥1%). IMPROVE consisted of educational activities, audit and feedback, reminders, organisational, team-directed, and patient-mediated activities. The primary outcome of the study was guideline adherence measured by nine patient safety indicators on the process (stop moments from the composite STOP bundle, and timely administration of antibiotics) and on the structure of perioperative care. Secondary safety outcomes included in-hospital complications, postoperative wound infections, mortality, length of hospital stay, and unplanned care. Data were analysed for 1934 patients. The IMPROVE programme improved one stop moment: 'discharge from recovery room' (+16%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9-23%). This stop moment was related to decreased mortality (-3%; 95% CI, -4% to -1%), fewer complications (-8%; 95% CI, -13% to -3%), and fewer unscheduled transfers to the ICU (-6%; 95% CI, -9% to -3%). IMPROVE negatively affected one other stop moment - 'discharge from the hospital' - possibly because of the limited resources of hospitals to improve all stop moments together. Mixed implementation effects of IMPROVE were found. We found some positive associations between guideline adherence and patient safety (i.e. mortality, complications, and unscheduled transfers to the ICU) except for the timely administration of antibiotics.

These data can then be evaluated by the anaesthesiologist; this is called the 'paper-based' preoperative evaluation. This method does require the conscientious cooperation between anaesthesiologists and surgeons; it should be clear which patients are eligible, what type of anaesthetic technique should be used, how the patient should be informed and how the informed consent is obtained. In our opinion, this paper-based evaluation combines safety and efficiency with patient-friendliness. It should be anchored in current guidelines to ensure quality.},

T-tau levels, however, can be increased in very early disease stages, when neurodegeneration is limited, and can be normal in advanced disease stages. This suggests that t-tau levels may be driven by other mechanisms as well. Because tau pathophysiology is emerging as treatment target for AD, we aimed to clarify molecular processes associated with CSF t-tau levels. We performed a proteomic, genomic, and imaging study in 1380 individuals with AD, in the preclinical, prodromal, and mild dementia stage, and 380 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and EMIF-AD Multimodality Biomarker Discovery study. We found that, relative to controls, AD individuals with increased t-tau had increased CSF concentrations of over 400 proteins enriched for neuronal plasticity processes. In contrast, AD individuals with normal t-tau had decreased levels of these plasticity proteins and showed increased concentrations of proteins indicative of blood-brain barrier and blood-CSF barrier dysfunction, relative to controls. The distinct proteomic profiles were already present in the preclinical AD stage and persisted in prodromal and dementia stages implying that they reflect disease traits rather than disease states. Dysregulated plasticity proteins were associated with SUZ12 and REST signaling, suggesting aberrant gene repression. GWAS analyses contrasting AD individuals with and without increased t-tau highlighted several genes involved in the regulation of gene expression. Targeted analyses of SNP rs9877502 in GMNC, associated with t-tau levels previously, correlated in individuals with AD with CSF concentrations of 591 plasticity associated proteins. The number of APOE-e4 alleles, however, was not associated with the concentration of plasticity related proteins. CSF t-tau levels in AD are associated with altered levels of proteins involved in neuronal plasticity and blood-brain and blood-CSF barrier dysfunction. Future trials may need to stratify on CSF t-tau status, as AD individuals with increased t-tau and normal t-tau are likely to respond differently to treatment, given their opposite CSF proteomic profiles.},

However, hardly any literature comparing the new protocols for PRF (the A-PRF+ and i-PRF) with the original protocol of PRF (L-PRF) is present for osteoblast-like cells. A-PRF+, L-PRF, and i-PRF were prepared from six male donors and pre-cultured with 10 mL culture medium for 6 days. 5 x 10 In osteoblast-like cells cultured with conditioned medium, the A-PRF+ conditioned medium induced more mineralization and calcium production after 28 days of culturing compared with the control (p < .05). No significant differences were found in the extent of cell proliferation between the different conditions. RUNX-2 and osteonectin mRNA expression in the cells were lower in all PRF-stimulated cultures compared with control at different time points. The i-PRF-conditioned medium induced more ALP activity (p < .05) compared with control and osteoblasts-like cells differentiated more compared with osteoblasts cultured with L-PRF. The three PRF preparations seem to have the capacity to increase the osteogenic potential of osteoblast-like cells.

Programs are patchwork, with variations across provinces in the availability of services, level of public funding, eligibility criteria and out-of-pocket costs borne by residents. Most provinces have cut long-term care bed capacity relative to the senior population in the past decade, without sufficiently expanding home and community care or adequately increasing staffing to reflect the higher acuity of the remaining residents. As a result, care is often rushed and underfunded, with poor working conditions leading to poor quality of care and quality of life for residents. This relationship between workers' and residents' well-being is well documented but poorly addressed. Also well researched but rarely reported are the negative impacts of privatization, at all levels: financing, ownership, management and delivery. This article describes the state of residential long-term care in Canada and proposes three policy directions: creating a pan-Canadian long-term care program, improving quality and reversing privatization.},

We used multi-center, multi-scanner datasets of anterior circulation stroke patients with baseline NCCT and CTA for training (n = 228) and testing (n = 100). We first found the occlusion location using StrokeViewer LVO and created a bounding box around it. Subsequently, we trained dual modality U-Net based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to segment the thrombus inside this bounding box. We experimented with: (1) U-Net with two input channels for NCCT and CTA, and U-Nets with two encoders where (2) concatenate, (3) add, and (4) weighted-sum operators were used for feature fusion. Furthermore, we proposed a dynamic bounding box algorithm to adjust the bounding box. The dynamic bounding box algorithm reduces the missed cases but does not improve Dice. The two-encoder U-Net with a weighted-sum feature fusion shows the best performance (surface Dice 0.78, Dice 0.62, and 4% missed cases). Final segmentation results have high spatial accuracies and can therefore be used to determine thrombus characteristics and potentially benefit radiologists in clinical practice.},

It was found that all these parameters increased under the influence of these cytokines. The release of calcium--used as a parameter of bone resorption--was highest in the combined presence of the cytokines. Although the absolute and relative enhancement by a combination of IL-1 alpha and EGF was most pronounced for collagenase (7-fold), both gelatinase A (5-fold) and gelatinase B (1.5-fold) had increased simultaneously. Calvariae produced a high level of MMP inhibitor (TIMP-1), especially under the influence of the cytokines; periosteum released little inhibitor.

Nine 5-HT agonists were examined for contractile effects on the arteries. In cerebral and meningeal arteries 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) was more potent than 5-HT. The opposite order of potency (5-HT-5-CT) was found in temporal arteries. In the cerebral arteries 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOHT) was more potent than sumatriptan while sumatriptan was more potent than 5-MeOHT in meningeal and temporal arteries. The 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, methiothepin, competitively antagonized 5-CT-induced contractions in cerebral arteries, with a pA2 value of 9.05. 5-HT-induced contractions were competitively antagonized by ketanserin (5-HT2) in the temporal arteries pA2 value of 9.06). Methiothepin and ketanserin had non-competitive antagonistic effects in the middle meningeal arteries. The 5-HT3 selective antagonist ondansetron did not cause any shift of the contractions induced by 2-methyl-5-HT in the temporal, cerebral and middle meningeal arteries. These results suggest that the cerebral arteries mainly contain 5-HT1D or 5-HT1-like receptors, and the temporal artery 5-HT2 receptors; the data further indicate the presence of both receptor subtypes in the middle meningeal artery.},

While previous studies described nurses' role during discrete activities (e.g. feedback), a more profound understanding of how nurses contribute to residents' learning remains warranted. Therefore, we used the educational concept of guidance and explored the extent to which residents' and nurses' perceptions align regarding nurses' guiding role and which reasons they provide for their perceptions. This mixed-method study was conducted at four Dutch university medical centres in 2021. We simultaneously collected quantitative and qualitative data from 103 residents and 401 nurses through a theory-informed questionnaire with a Likert-scale and open-ended questions. We analyzed quantitative data to explore respondents' perceptions of nurses' guiding role by using anova. The thematically analyzed qualitative open comments explored respondents' reasons for their perceptions. Nurses indicated to provide significantly more support (p = .01) and guidance on learning from patient care (p < .01) than perceived by residents. Moreover, nurses indicated that attending physicians did not always involve them in guiding residents, whereas residents perceived nurses were being involved (p < .001). Themes suggest that nurses and residents could be divided into two groups: (i) respondents who felt that guiding was inextricably linked to good interprofessional collaboration and patient care and (ii) respondents who saw the guiding role as limited and emphasised the distinct fields of expertise between nurses and physicians. Residents and nurses felt that nurses played an important role in guiding residents' workplace learning. However, some residents did not always perceive to be guided. To further capitalise on nurses' guiding role, we suggest that residents can be encouraged to engage in the learning opportunities nurses provide to achieve optimal team-based patient care.},

  abstract = {The process of monoisotopic mass determination, i.e., nomination of the correct peak of an isotopically resolved group of peptide peaks as a monoisotopic peak, requires prior information about the isotopic distribution of the peptide. This points immediately to the difficulty of monoisotopic mass determination, whereas a single mass spectrum does not contain information about the atomic composition of a peptide and therefore the isotopic distribution of the peptide remains unknown. To solve this problem a technique is required, which is able to estimate the isotopic distribution given the information of a single mass spectrum. Senko et al. calculated the average isotopic distribution for any mass peptide via the multinomial expansion (Yergey 1983), using a scaled version of the average amino acid Averagine (Senko et al. 1995). Another method, introduced by Breen et al., approximates the result of the multinomial expansion by a Poisson model (Breen et al. 2000). Although both methods perform well, they have their specific limitations. In this manuscript, we propose an alternative method for the prediction of the isotopic distribution based on a model for consecutive ratios of peaks from the isotopic distribution, similar in spirit to the approach introduced by Gay et al. (1999). The presented method is computationally simple and accurate in predicting the expected isotopic distribution. Further, we extend our method to estimate the isotopic distribution of sulphur-containing peptides. This is important because the naturally occurring isotopes of sulphur have an impact on the isotopic distribution of a peptide.},

The platform needed to be relatively affordable, rapid to deploy, and use a common and accessible technology. Central to this project, we wanted to make the content of the platform open to any investigator without restriction. In designing this array we prioritized a number of types of genetic variability for inclusion, such as known risk alleles, disease-causing mutations, putative risk alleles, and other functionally important variants. The array was primarily designed to allow rapid screening of samples for disease-causing mutations and large population studies of risk factors. Notably, an explicit aim was to make this array widely available to facilitate data sharing across and within diseases. The resulting array, NeuroX, is a remarkably cost and time effective solution for high-quality genotyping. NeuroX comprises a backbone of standard Illumina exome content of approximately 240,000 variants, and over 24,000 custom content variants focusing on neurologic diseases. Data are generated at approximately $50-$60 per sample using a 12-sample format chip and regular Infinium infrastructure; thus, genotyping is rapid and accessible to many investigators. Here, we describe the design of NeuroX, discuss the utility of NeuroX in the analyses of rare and common risk variants, and present quality control metrics and a brief primer for the analysis of NeuroX derived data.},

Researchers have listed the advantages of LDPs, but knowledge of how and why organization-level outcomes are achieved is missing. To investigate how, why and under which circumstances LDPs for physicians can impact organization-level outcomes. We conducted a realist review, following the RAMESES guidelines. Scientific articles and grey literature published between January 2010 and March 2021 evaluating a leadership intervention for physicians in the hospital setting were considered for inclusion. The following databases were searched: Medline, PsycInfo, ERIC, Web of Science, and Academic Search Premier. Based on the included documents, we developed a LDP middle-range program theory (MRPT) consisting of Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations (CMOs) describing how specific contexts (C) trigger certain mechanisms (M) to generate organization-level outcomes (O). In total, 3904 titles and abstracts and, subsequently, 100 full-text documents were inspected; 38 documents with LDPs from multiple countries informed our MRPT. The MRPT includes five CMOs that describe how LDPs can impact the organization-level outcomes categories 'culture', 'quality improvement', and 'the leadership pipeline': 'Acquiring self-insight and people skills (CMO1)', 'Intentionally building professional networks (CMO2)', 'Supporting quality improvement projects (CMO3)', 'Tailored LDP content prepares physicians (CMO4)', and 'Valuing physician leaders and organizational commitment (CMO5)'. Culture was the outcome of CMO1 and CMO2, quality improvement of CMO2 and CMO3, and the leadership pipeline of CMO2, CMO4, and CMO5. These CMOs operated within an overarching context, the leadership ecosystem, that determined realizing and sustaining organization-level outcomes. LDPs benefit organization-level outcomes through multiple mechanisms. Creating the contexts to trigger these mechanisms depends on the resources invested in LDPs and adequately supporting physicians. LDP providers can use the presented MRPT to guide the development of LDPs when aiming for specific organization-level outcomes.},

This contraction is blocked by D-myo-inositol-1,2,6-triphosphate (alpha-trinositol). Previous binding studies have shown that alpha-trinositol has no effect at Y1 or Y2 binding sites thus the antagonistic effect should occur at the level of a second messenger. We have examined the effects of NPY on the formation of inositol phosphates (IP) and have looked for an antagonistic effect of alpha-trinositol. NPY (10(-9)-3 x 10-(-7) M) induced strong concentration-dependent contraction of basilar arteries from young guinea-pigs (weight 200-250 g) (Emax: 76.4 +/- 11.1%) but not of arteries from old guinea-pigs (weight > 500 g) (Emax: 2.8 +/- 1.5%). [Pro34]NPY and PYY induced contraction of similar magnitude and potency, whereas NPY13-36 had only a weak effect. This demonstrates an effect via the Y1 type of NPY receptor. The contraction induced by NPY was blocked by alpha-trinositol (p < 0.05). LiCI (2 x 10-4) M), used to inhibit IP breakdown, had no effect on the contraction induced by NPY. NPY (10(-10)-10(-8) M) increased the formation of IP in cerebral vessels from young guinea-pigs from 357 +/- 48 cpm/mg w.w. to 900 +/- 233 cpm/mg w.w. However, there was no alteration in IP formation in cerebral vessels from old guinea-pigs (NPY 10(-9)-10(-7) M). In the presence of alpha-trinositol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) the NPY induced stimulation of IP formation was totally abolished.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

It has been suggested, through computational models, that the presence of microcalcifications in the atherosclerotic cap can increase the risk of cap rupture. However, the experimental confirmation of this hypothesis is still lacking. In this study, we have developed a novel tissue-engineered model to mimic the atherosclerotic fibrous cap with microcalcifications and assess the impact of microcalcifications on cap mechanics. First, human carotid plaque caps were analyzed to determine the distribution, size, and density of microcalcifications in real cap tissue. Hydroxyapatite particles with features similar to real cap microcalcifications were used as microcalcification mimics. Injected clusters of hydroxyapatite particles were embedded in a fibrin gel seeded with human myofibroblasts which deposited a native-like collagenous matrix around the particles, during the 21-day culture period. Second harmonic multiphoton microscopy imaging revealed higher local collagen fiber dispersion in regions of hydroxyapatite clusters. Tissue-engineered caps with hydroxyapatite particles demonstrated lower stiffness and ultimate tensile stress than the control group samples under uniaxial tensile loading, suggesting increased rupture risk in atherosclerotic plaques with microcalcifications. This model supports previous computational findings regarding a detrimental role for microcalcifications in cap rupture risk and can further be deployed to elucidate tissue mechanics in pathologies with calcifying soft tissues.},

A 20-mmol bolus of magnesium sulfate was administered intravenously. Median magnesium levels increased from 1.04 (interquartile range 0.94-1.23) mmol/L to 1.72 (1.57-2.14) mmol/L after 60 minutes of magnesium infusion (p < 0.001) but decreased to 1.27 (1.21-1.36) and 1.16 (1.11-1.21) mmol/L after 6 and 12 hours, respectively. Urinary magnesium concentration increased from 6.3 (4.2-14.5) mmol/L to 19.1 (7.4-34.5) mmol/L after 60 minutes (p < 0.001), followed by 22.7 (18.4-36.7) and 15 (8.4-19.7) mmol/L after 6 and 12 hours, respectively. Over the 12-hour observation period, the cumulative urinary magnesium excretion was 19.1 mmol (95.5% of the dose given). The median magnesium clearance was 10 (4.7-15.8) mL/min and increased to 14.9 (3.8-20.7; p = 0.934) mL/min at 60 minutes. The estimated volume of distribution was 0.31 (0.28-0.34) L/kg. Magnesium bolus therapy after cardiac surgery leads to a significant but short-lived increase of magnesium serum concentration due to renal excretion and distribution, and the magnesium balance is neutral after 12 hours.},

Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of a NINJ1 oligomer segmented from NINJ1 rings. Each NINJ1 subunit comprises amphipathic (⍺1, ⍺2) and transmembrane (TM) helices (⍺3, ⍺4) and forms a chain of subunits, mainly by the TM helices and ⍺1. ⍺3 and ⍺4 are kinked, and the Gly residues are important for function. The NINJ1 oligomer possesses a concave hydrophobic side that should face the membrane and a convex hydrophilic side formed by ⍺1 and ⍺2, presumably upon activation. This structural observation suggests that NINJ1 can form membrane disks, consistent with membrane fragmentation by recombinant NINJ1. Live-cell and super-resolution imaging uncover ring-like structures on the plasma membrane that are released into the culture supernatant. Released NINJ1 encircles a membrane inside, as shown by lipid staining. Therefore, NINJ1-mediated membrane disk formation is different from gasdermin-mediated pore formation, resulting in membrane loss and plasma membrane rupture.},

We investigated a barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutant with reduced epicuticular leaf waxes on which spores of adapted and nonadapted powdery mildew fungi showed reduced germination. The barley gene responsible for the mutant wax phenotype was cloned in a forward genetic screen and identified to encode a 3-KETOACYL-CoA SYNTHASE (HvKCS6), a protein participating in fatty acid elongation and required for synthesis of epicuticular waxes. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the mutant has significantly fewer aliphatic wax constituents with a chain length above C-24. Complementation of the mutant restored wild-type wax and overcame germination penalty, indicating that wax constituents less present on the mutant are a crucial clue for spore germination. Investigation of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) transgenic plants with sense silencing of Arabidopsis REQUIRED FOR CUTICULAR WAX PRODUCTION1, the HvKCS6 ortholog, revealed the same germination phenotype against adapted and nonadapted powdery mildew fungi. Our findings hint to an evolutionary conserved mechanism for sensing of plant surfaces among distantly related powdery mildews that is based on KCS6-derived wax components. Perception of such a signal must have been evolved before the monocot-dicot split took place approximately 150 million years ago.},

Its incidence is unknown, and the insidious and nonspecific nature of symptoms may contribute to considerable diagnostic delay. We conducted the current study to assess the incidence and clinicoradiologic characteristics of idiopathic RPF. For this, we evaluated prospectively 53 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic RPF at our tertiary care referral center from April 1998 through January 2008.Calculated annual incidence of RPF was 1.3/100,000 inhabitants. Mean age was 64 +/- 11.1 (SD) yr; male-female ratio was 3.3:1.0. Median duration of symptoms was 6.0 mo (IQR 3.0-12.0). Abdominal, flank, and/or back pain and discomfort were the major symptoms, with visual analogue scale scores of 49 +/- 27.2 mm and 43 +/- 29.4 mm for pain and discomfort, respectively. Female patients had higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), higher white blood cell count, and lower hemoglobin content than male patients at presentation. Computed tomography-documented maximal mass thickness amounted to 35 +/- 16.6 mm; craniocaudal length amounted to 137 +/- 48.8 mm. RPF mass extension up to or above the level of the renal vessels was noted in 3 patients (6%). Six patients (11%) presented with atypical RPF localization and/or bulky mass. Localized lymphadenopathy adjacent to the RPF mass was observed frequently (25%). Patients with hydronephrosis (56%) presented earlier than patients without hydronephrosis, with higher creatinine and greater mass thickness but similar pain severity. Patients were typically at high cardiovascular risk with increased-often aneurysmal-infrarenal aortic diameter (25.0 mm, IQR 22.0-30.0). RPF mass distribution was similar in patients with or without aneurysmal dilation. Occupational asbestos exposure (20%) and asbestos-related pleural changes (17%) were frequent among males. Previous or concurrent chronic inflammatory disease and/or autoimmune disease was noted in 8 patients (15%). Multivariate analysis revealed an independent association of ESR values with severity of pain and discomfort. Smoking was independently associated with infrarenal aortic diameter.In summary, annual RPF incidence is higher than previously assumed. Age at diagnosis and male-female ratio seem to have changed over time. RPF typically affects patients at high cardiovascular risk, including increased aortic diameter. Clinical presentation is influenced by sex, severity of inflammation and presence of hydronephrosis. Prolonged asbestos exposure and asbestos-related pleural changes were frequent among males. Localized lymphadenopathy adjacent to the RPF mass occurs frequently and should not confuse RPF diagnosis.},

The present study describes a CM-induced vasoconstriction of isolated rabbit coronary arteries that depends on chemotoxicity and ion content of the CM. Rings of arteries were mounted in tissue baths and the constrictions induced by different CM were measured. Iotrolan and iodixanol (non-ionic dimers) caused the most powerful constrictions followed by iohexol (non-ionic monomer) and mannitol. Ioxaglate (ionic dimer) and diatrizoate (ionic monomer) caused no or weak constrictions. By comparing these findings with previous studies, it is concluded that non-ionic media cause vasoconstriction due to depolarization of the smooth muscle cells, an effect that for iohexol can be counteracted by addition of 30 mM NaCl. The ionic media seem to cause hyperpolarization of the cells. This difference between non-ionic and ionic CM might be one of the reasons for the lower tendency of non-ionic CM to cause vasodilatation clinically.},

Vasoconstriction dependent on potential-operated calcium channels (POCs) (potassium chloride), or receptor-operated calcium channels (ROCs) (histamine, endothelin-1, and prostaglandin F2 [PGF2 alpha]) was specifically studied. Segments of rabbit coronary arteries were mounted between two L-shaped prongs in tissue baths with buffer solution or solutions of iohexol (140 mg I/mL) with addition of different concentrations of NaCl and CaCl2. The responses of the vessels to increasing concentrations of a vasoconstrictor were examined. Concentration of vasoconstrictor versus contractile response curves were plotted, and the maximal contraction of the vasoconstrictor (Emax) and half maximal constriction were calculated. Addition of 30 mM NaCl and 1.5 mM CaCl2 caused a vasoconstriction to KCl in iohexol almost identical to its vasoconstriction in buffer. Higher concentrations of NaCl caused decreasing Emax of all vasoconstrictors. The inhibition of the ROC-dependent vasoconstrictors could not be normalized by the addition of electrolytes. The inhibition of the POC-dependent vasoconstrictor was caused by "ion toxicity" of iohexol. The inhibition of the ROC-dependent vasoconstrictors was caused by other mechanisms, in a manner compatible with a blocking effect on ROCs.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION--Cerebral blood vessels are innervated by sympathetic nerve fibres storing neuropeptide Y (NPY), parasympathetic nerves storing acetylcholine, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and sensory afferent fibres containing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP) and neurokinin A. In experimental studies on subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) there are indications that perivascular peptides are involved. In the present study we have in man measured the levels of NPY, VIP, SP and CGRP in brain vessels of patients that have suffered a fatal SAH and compared this with the levels encountered in subjects that died of an extracerebral cause. MATERIAL AND METHODS--Vessels from patients who have died from SAH or nonSAH were obtained during autopsy performed within 24 hrs after death. The peptides were extracted and fractionated with reversed phase liquid chromatography (HPLC). The levels of NPY, VIP, SP, and CGRP were measured with radioimmunoassay. Vasomotor responses of human cerebral arteries were performed using a sensitive in vitro system. RESULTS--Human cerebral vessels contained NPY, VIP, CGRP and SP which eluted at the same positions as the authentic peptides. The level of CGRP was significantly lower (p < 0.01) in arteries removed from SAH patients as compared to control subjects. The level of SP was not changed, if anything it tended to be increased after SAH. The levels of NPY and VIP were not significantly altered after SAH. In isolated brain vessels alpha-CGRP was a potent vasodilator of arteries precontracted with whole blood, prostaglandin F2 alpha or endothelin. It had a poor effect on vessels precontracted with 60 mM potassium. CONCLUSION--The evidence suggest that the trigemino-cerebrovascular system, storing CGRP and SP, is to a differential degree involved in the pathophysiology of SAH in man and supports the hypothesis of an exhaustion of CGRP as one important factor in the development of late spasm occurring after SAH.},

Previous studies reported that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau (t-tau) levels vary between patients. Here we show that CSF t-tau variability is associated with distinct impairments in neuronal plasticity mediated by gene repression factors SUZ12 and REST. AD individuals with abnormal t-tau levels have increased CSF concentrations of plasticity proteins regulated by SUZ12 and REST. AD individuals with normal t-tau, on the contrary, have decreased concentrations of these plasticity proteins and increased concentrations in proteins associated with blood-brain and blood CSF-barrier dysfunction. Genomic analyses suggested that t-tau levels in part depend on genes involved in gene expression. The distinct plasticity abnormalities in AD as signaled by t-tau urge the need for personalised treatment.},

Older females used rational judgements to weigh up the possibilities of risks, interests and advantages related to their cultural, spiritual and social system. Other factors were staff behaviour that was characterized as unfriendly and lacking for respect as to the living conditions and thinking of the pregnant women in the village. Ethnographic research provided an understanding of traditional structures that have an influence on the decisions and behaviour of the community related to childbirth.

However, expensive and laborious screenings in vivo are necessary to assess the safety and efficacy of their formulations. Rodents are the first choice for initial in vivo screens but their size limits the dimensions and number of the bone grafts that can be tested in orthotopic locations. Here, we report the development of a refined murine subcutaneous model for semi-orthotopic bone formation that allows the testing of up to four grafts per mouse one order of magnitude greater in volume than currently possible in mice. Crucially, these defects are also "critical size" and unable to heal within the timeframe of the study without intervention. The model is based on four bovine bone implants, ring-shaped, where the bone healing potential of distinct grafts can be evaluated in vivo. In this study we demonstrate that promotion and prevention of ossification can be assessed in our model. For this, we used a semi-automatic algorithm for longitudinal micro-CT image registration followed by histological analyses. Taken together, our data supports that this model is suitable as a platform for the real-time screening of bone formation, and provides the possibility to study bone resorption, osseointegration and vascularisation.},

This question was studied in guinea-pig cerebral vessels by using NPY as a strong inhibitor and alpha-trinositol as its antagonist. The basal cyclic AMP content of cerebral vessel segments in the control group was 670 +/- 53 fmol/mg wet weight (w.w.). Forskolin (10(-7), 3 x 10(-7) and 10(-6) M) increased the formation of cyclic AMP to 738 +/- 86 (ns), 699 +/- 81 (ns) and 1158 +/- 132 fmol/mg w.w. (p < 0.05), respectively. alpha-trinositol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) neither reduced the formation of cyclic AMP compared to basal cyclic AMP levels nor affected the forskolin-stimulated increase of cyclic AMP (p > 0.05). On the other hand, NPY (10(-7) M) not only decreased basal formation of cyclic AMP (p < 0.05) but also attenuated the forskolin-stimulated increase of cyclic AMP (p < 0.005). The inhibitory effects of NPY on both basal levels of cyclic AMP and forskolin-induced increase of cyclic AMP were not reversed by the application of alpha-trinositol (10(-8)-10(-6) M). In studies on vasomotor responses, forskolin (10(-9)-10(-5) M) induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of precontracted guinea-pig basilar arteries. NPY (10(-7) M) shifted the forskolin-induced relaxation of the basilar arteries towards higher forskolin concentrations. This inhibitory effect of NPY was reversed by alpha-trinositol (10(-6) M). We conclude that 1) NPY decreases basal and forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP levels; 2) alpha-trinositol neither reverses the inhibitory effect of NPY on nor modulates basal or forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP levels; 3) However, the antagonistic effect of NPY on forskolin-induced relaxation is significantly reversed by administration of alpha-trinositol. This demonstrates a dissociation of the dilator effects of forskolin and its generation of cyclic AMP.},

After the culture period the following parameters were assessed: number of cells, the morphology of the cells, the attachment of the cells, alkaline phosphatase activity, and the level of total protein (α= 0.05). Statistical analysis revealed a significantly higher cell count on the third (F = 17.4, p < 0.001) and eighth day (F = 163, p < 0.001) for nanoporous zirconia and SLA titanium surfaces compared to polished specimens. The number of cells (nanoporous zirconia 160 ± 20/mm(2) , SLA titanium 133 ± 15/mm(2) ) and cell size (nanoporous zirconia 50.7 ± 3 μm, SLA titanium 42.5 ± 4 μm) were significantly higher than polished specimens. Nanoporous zirconia specimens demonstrated comparable alkaline phosphatase activity (0.0036 ± 0.0035 ng/μl) and intracellular protein content (72.7 ± 0.9 ng/μl) compared to other tested groups. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that cells attached on the polished surface using finger-like processes, whereas on the nanoporous surface, finger-like processes were not observed, as the cell membrane appeared to be in close proximity to the underlying surface. The findings of this study suggest that a nanoporous zirconia surface favors cell growth and attachment compared to a polished surface. It was proposed that a nanoporous zirconia surface may improve clinical performance of zirconia implants.},

We hypothesized that the use of CAS optimizes the position of the femoral component and improves PROMs. This is a multicenter, single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of two groups. In the CAS group guiding of the femoral component was done with imageless navigation. In the Conventional (control) group the femoral component was placed manually according to the preplanned position. The primary outcome measure consists of a maximum of 3 degrees difference between the postoperative Stem Shaft Angle (SSA) and preplanned SSA. Secondary outcome measures consist of the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale (HOOS), the Harris Hip Score (HHS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain score. A total of 122 patients were randomized, 61 in the CAS group and 61 in the conventional group. There was no significant differences in accuracy of femoral implant position. The mean difference between the postoperative- and preplanned SSA was - 2.26 and - 1.75 degrees (more varus) respectively in the CAS and Conventional group. After surgery both groups show significant improvement in all PROMs compared to the baseline measurements, with no significant differences between the groups.

It has been suggested, through computational models, that the presence and specific location of microcalcifications in the atherosclerotic cap can increase the risk of cap rupture. However, the experimental confirmation of this hypothesis is lacking. In this study, we investigated how the presence and location of microcalcifications, relative to the lumen, influence (local) mechanics and rupture behavior of atherosclerotic plaque caps. Using tissue-engineered fibrous cap analogs with hydroxyapatite (HA) clusters to mimic calcifications in human plaque caps, we replicated the microcalcification distribution observed in human carotid plaques, as identified by our histological analysis. The analogs were imaged using multiphoton microscopy with second-harmonic generation to assess local collagen fiber orientation and dispersion. Subsequently, they underwent uniaxial tensile testing to failure, during which local strain and failure characteristics were analyzed. Our results revealed that HA clusters, particularly those in the luminal region, contribute to increased local collagen fiber dispersion. Moreover, the presence of HA clusters reduced both failure tensile stress and strain in the TE cap analogs. Besides, the rupture location shifted toward the site of HA clusters. Additionally, rupture initiation was consistently found in high-strain regions, and in 86 % of the analogs, even at the highest strain location in the sample. Our findings suggest that microcalcification clusters in plaque caps may increase the cap rupture risk and relocate the rupture site. Moreover, local strain measurements can serve as an additional tool for plaque cap rupture risk assessment.},

Before constructing a classification rule, we attempted to pre-process the data and to select features of the spectra that were likely due to true biological signals (i.e., peptides/proteins). As a result, we selected a set of 92 features. To construct the classification rule, we considered eight methods for selecting a subset of the features, combined with seven classification methods. The performance of the resulting 56 combinations was evaluated by using a cross-validation procedure with 1000 re-sampled data sets. The best result, as indicated by the lowest overall misclassification rate, was obtained by using the whole set of 92 features as the input for a support-vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel. This method was therefore used to construct the classification rule. For the training data set, the total error rate for the classification rule, as estimated by using leave-one-out cross-validation, was equal to 0.16, with the sensitivity and specificity equal to 0.87 and 0.82, respectively.},

Activator E2Fs, E2F1-3, induce an upswing of E2F targets, which is essential for the G1-to-S phase transition, whereas atypical E2Fs, E2F7 and E2F8, mediate a downswing of the same targets during late S, G2, and M phases. Expression of atypical E2Fs is induced by E2F1-3, but it is unknown how atypical E2Fs are inactivated in a timely manner. Here, we demonstrate that E2F7 and E2F8 are substrates of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Removal of CDH1, or mutating the CDH1-interacting KEN boxes, stabilized E2F7/8 from anaphase onwards and during G1. Expressing KEN mutant E2F7 during G1 impairs S phase entry and eventually results in cell death. Furthermore, we show that E2F8, but not E2F7, interacts also with APC/C(C) (dc20). Importantly, atypical E2Fs can activate APC/C(C) (dh1) by repressing its inhibitors cyclin A, cyclin E, and Emi1. In conclusion, we discovered a feedback loop between atypical E2Fs and APC/C(C) (dh1), which ensures balanced expression of cell cycle genes and normal cell cycle progression.},

Beyond the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), comparatively little is known about whether CV-associated genes also increase risk for AD. Using large genome-wide association studies and validated tools to quantify genetic overlap, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with AD and one or more CV-associated RFs, namely body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary artery disease (CAD), waist hip ratio (WHR), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of plasma lipids (TG, TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR < 0.05 we identified 90 SNPs on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV-associated outcomes. In meta-analyses across three independent cohorts, we found four novel loci within MBLAC1 (chromosome 7, meta-p = 1.44 × 10},

We have observed such an intermolecular complex between a plasmid carrying the d(C)18 d(G)18 insert and the d(AG)5 oligonucleotide without bivalent cations in 200 mM of Na+ at pH4.0. Bivalent cations additionally stabilize the complex. We propose the structures for nearly isomorphous base-triads TA*A, CG*G and CG*A+. To identify the H-DNA-like structure, which includes the triplex between d(C)n d(G)n duplex and the AG-strand, we have cloned in a superhelical plasmid the insert: G10TTAA(AG)5. The data on photofootprinting and chemical modification with diethyl pyrocarbonate, potassium permanganate and dimethyl sulfate demonstrate that the H-like structure with triplex carrying CG*G and CG*A+ base triads is actually formed under acid conditions. In the course of this study we have come across unexpected results on probing of Py-Pu-Pu triplexes by dimethyl sulfate (DMS): the protection effect is observed not only for guanines entering the duplex but also for guanines in the third strand lying in the major groove. We have demonstrated this effect not only for the case the novel protonated Py-Pu-Pu triplex but also for the traditional non-protonated Py-Pu-Pu intramolecular triplex (H*-DNA) formed by the d(C)37 d(G)37 insert in supercoiled plasmid in the presence of Mg2+ ions.},

Until now, literature is scarce about sensorimotor deficits in adult ADHD. This is a pilot study that identifies and quantifies the role of sensory, motor, and central adaptation mechanisms for adult ADHD patients' sensorimotor deficits in a systematic way, using postural control. We analyzed spontaneous and externally perturbed stance in ten adult patients suffering from ADHD. Findings were compared to data from ten matched healthy subjects. Spontaneous sway amplitudes and velocities were larger in ADHD patients compared to healthy subjects. Furthermore, body excursions as a function of platform tilts were abnormally large in ADHD patients, specifically in the low frequency range. Based on simple feedback model simulations, we found that ADHD patients showed a larger time delay between platform tilts and body response, and a lower value of the integral part of the neural controller, which affects the long-term control of their posture. These postural abnormalities correlated well with the hyperactivity and impulsivity dimensions of the individual ADHD symptoms. We conclude that adult ADHD patients' major postural deficit consists of an impairment of a stable, long-term sensorimotor behavior, which fits very well to the concept of impulsivity and hyperactivity.},

How exactly abnormal karyotypes arise and are propagated in AML is unclear. TP53 mutations and deletions are frequent in complex karyotype AML, suggesting a role of TP53 alterations in the development of chromosome abnormalities. Here, we generated isogenic TP53-knockout versions of the euploid AML cell line EEB to investigate the impact of TP53 on karyotype stability. We show that chromosome abnormalities spontaneously arise in TP53-deficient cells. Numerical aneuploidy could, to some extent, be propagated in a TP53-proficient setting, indicating that it does not necessarily trigger TP53 activation. In contrast, tolerance to structural chromosome aberrations was almost entirely restricted to TP53-knockout clones, all of which were able to continue proliferation in the presence of damaged DNA. Mechanistically, as a source of chromosome aberrations, limited numerical but not structural chromosomal instability was tolerated by TP53-wildtype cells. In contrast, structural instability was found only in TP53-knockout cells. Together, in myeloid cells TP53 loss allows for the development of complex karyotype aberrations and karyotype heterogeneity by perpetuation of chromosome segregation errors.},

Twenty-six patients with iRPF receiving tamoxifen monotherapy underwent repeated FDG-PET (baseline and, if positive, at 3 months) and computed tomographic (CT) scanning (baseline, 4 and 8 months). Maximal RPF mass thickness in 3 different view directions was measured on each CT scan; FDG-uptake was semi-quantified using a visual 4-point scale. Initial and follow-up PET scan results were correlated with clinical, laboratory and CT scan follow-up data. Treatment outcome was the aggregate measure of clinical, laboratory and CT-documented response to tamoxifen. FDG-PET was positive in 20 patients. Patients with positive PET scan result had higher C-reactive protein level (P=0.02) and larger mass size (P=0.01) compared with patients with negative PET scan result. Visual PET score correlated with C-reactive protein level (P=0.002) and CT-documented mass thickness (P=0.04). Visual PET score decreased following treatment (P<0.01). This decrease correlated with decrease in ESR (P<0.001) but not with CT-documented mass regression. Positive predicting value (PPV) of initial positive PET scan result was 0.63; PPV of negative follow-up PET scan result in patients with initial positive PET scan result was 0.66. FDG-PET is valuable in detecting (recurrent) disease activity. Short-term follow-up with FDG-PET cannot be routinely recommended for the therapeutic evaluation of RPF disease in tamoxifen-treated patients.},

Consistent with previous reports, rs429358 (apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4) is associated with lower odds of surviving to the 90th and 99th percentile age, while rs7412 (ApoE ε2) shows the opposite. Moreover, rs7676745, located near GPR78, associates with lower odds of surviving to the 90th percentile age. Gene-level association analysis reveals a role for tissue-specific expression of multiple genes in longevity. Finally, genetic correlation of the longevity GWA results with that of several disease-related phenotypes points to a shared genetic architecture between health and longevity.},

Here, we show that MINFLUX implemented with a standard microscope stand can attain 1-3 nm resolution in three dimensions, rendering fluorescence microscopy with molecule-scale resolution widely applicable. Advances, such as synchronized electro-optical and galvanometric beam steering and a stabilization that locks the sample position to sub-nanometer precision with respect to the stand, ensure nanometer-precise and accurate real-time localization of individually activated fluorophores. In our MINFLUX imaging of cell- and neurobiological samples, ~800 detected photons suffice to attain a localization precision of 2.2 nm, whereas ~2500 photons yield precisions <1 nm (standard deviation). We further demonstrate 3D imaging with localization precision of ~2.4 nm in the focal plane and ~1.9 nm along the optic axis. Localizing with a precision of <20 nm within ~100 µs, we establish this spatio-temporal resolution in single fluorophore tracking and apply it to the diffusion of single labeled lipids in lipid-bilayer model membranes.},

Here, we compared regional gray matter (GM) volumes and associated gene expression profiles between cognitively-defined subgroups of amyloid-β positive individuals clinically diagnosed with AD dementia (age: 66 ± 7, 47% male, MMSE: 21 ± 5). All participants underwent neuropsychological assessment with tests covering memory, executive-functioning, language and visuospatial-functioning domains. Subgroup classification was achieved using a psychometric framework that assesses which cognitive domain shows substantial relative impairment compared to the intra-individual average across domains, which yielded the following subgroups in our sample; AD-Memory (n = 41), AD-Executive (n = 117), AD-Language (n = 33), AD-Visuospatial (n = 171). We performed voxel-wise contrasts of GM volumes derived from 3Tesla structural MRI between subgroups and controls (n = 127, age 58 ± 9, 42% male, MMSE 29 ± 1), and observed that differences in regional GM volumes compared to controls closely matched the respective cognitive profiles. Specifically, we detected lower medial temporal lobe GM volumes in AD-Memory, lower fronto-parietal GM volumes in AD-Executive, asymmetric GM volumes in the temporal lobe (left < right) in AD-Language, and lower GM volumes in posterior areas in AD-Visuospatial. In order to examine possible biological drivers of these differences in regional GM volumes, we correlated subgroup-specific regional GM volumes to brain-wide gene expression profiles based on a stereotactic characterization of the transcriptional architecture of the human brain as provided by the Allen human brain atlas. Gene-set enrichment analyses revealed that variations in regional expression of genes involved in processes like mitochondrial respiration and metabolism of proteins were associated with patterns of regional GM volume across multiple subgroups. Other gene expression vs GM volume-associations were only detected in particular subgroups, e.g., genes involved in the cell cycle for AD-Memory, specific sets of genes related to protein metabolism in AD-Language, and genes associated with modification of gene expression in AD-Visuospatial. We conclude that cognitively-defined AD subgroups show neurobiological differences, and distinct biological pathways may be involved in the emergence of these differences.},

Although some information is available on its formation, the mechanisms involved in its degradation are not understood. Here, we present evidence for lysosomal digestion of type VI collagen by fibroblasts of periosteal explants. In the lysosomal apparatus of these cells, broad-banded filamentous aggregates characterized by 100-nm periodicity were found, which proved to consist of type VI collagen as indicated by their stainability with anti-type VI collagen antibodies. By interfering with synthesis (ascorbate or alpha, alpha-dipyridyl), intracellular translocation of collagen-containing vesicles (colchicine) as well as phagocytosis (cytochalasin B), it was shown that the intracellular broad-banded type VI collagen represented phagocytosed material. In the presence of acidotropic agents (NH4Cl and methylamine) the amount of intracellular type VI collagen increased significantly (5- to 10-fold), suggesting that a rise of pH in the endosomal/lysosomal apparatus causes inhibition of its degradation. By using a variety of proteinase inhibitors, it was found that inhibition of collagenase (when used in combination with NH4Cl), or inhibition of cysteine proteinases (both with and without NH4Cl), resulted in an increased amount of intracellular type VI collagen, whereas inhibition of serine proteinases significantly lowered the level of intracellular type VI collagen. The data presented are the first to indicate a pathway by which type VI collagen degradation may occur: fibroblasts phagocytose type VI collagen and subsequently digest this collagen in their lysosomal apparatus. Degradation depends on the activity of several enzymes, among them collagenase and serine proteinases, probably exerting their activity in the extracellular space just before the actual internalization. After uptake, digestion involves pH-sensitive lysosomal enzymes, including those belonging to the class of cysteine proteinases.},

For chronic inflammatory diseases, recent guidelines recommend the development of combined malnutrition and inflammation risk scores.

In a prospective cohort study, we examined fifty-five patients with CD in remission (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) <200) at 0 and 6 months. We assessed disease activity (CDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw index), inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), faecal calprotectin (FC)), malnutrition (BMI, subjective global assessment (SGA), serum albumin, handgrip strength), body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis) and administered the newly developed 'Malnutrition Inflammation Risk Tool' (MIRT; containing BMI, unintentional weight loss over 3 months and CRP). All parameters were evaluated regarding their ability to predict disease outcome prospectively at 6 months. At baseline, more than one-third of patients showed elevated inflammatory markers despite clinical remission (36·4 % CRP ≥5 mg/l, 41·5 % FC ≥100 µg/g). Prevalence of malnutrition at baseline according to BMI, SGA and serum albumin was 2-16 %. At 6 months, MIRT significantly predicted outcome in numerous nutritional and clinical parameters (SGA, CD-related flares, hospitalisations and surgeries). In contrast, SGA, handgrip strength, BMI, albumin and body composition had no influence on the clinical course. The newly developed MIRT was found to reliably predict clinical outcome in CD patients. This screening tool might be used to facilitate clinical decision making, including treatment of both inflammation and malnutrition in order to prevent complications.},

To assess the value of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the automatic segmentation of infarct volume in follow-up CT images in a large population of patients with acute ischemic stroke. We included CT images of 1026 patients from a large pooling of patients with acute ischemic stroke. A reference standard for the infarct segmentation was generated by manual delineation. We introduce three CNN models for the segmentation of subtle, intermediate, and severe hypodense lesions. The fully automated infarct segmentation was defined as the combination of the results of these three CNNs. The results of the three-CNNs approach were compared with the results from a single CNN approach and with the reference standard segmentations. The median infarct volume was 48 mL (IQR 15-125 mL). Comparison between the volumes of the three-CNNs approach and manually delineated infarct volumes showed excellent agreement, with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.88. Even better agreement was found for severe and intermediate hypodense infarcts, with ICCs of 0.98 and 0.93, respectively. Although the number of patients used for training in the single CNN approach was much larger, the accuracy of the three-CNNs approach strongly outperformed the single CNN approach, which had an ICC of 0.34. Convolutional neural networks are valuable and accurate in the quantitative assessment of infarct volumes, for both subtle and severe hypodense infarcts in follow-up CT images.

Years of molecular neurobiology research indicate that neurotransmission depends on such optimization strategies. However, the molecular topography of the presynaptic active zone (AZ), where transmitter is released upon synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion, remains to be visualized. Therefore, we implemented MINFLUX optical nanoscopy to resolve the AZ of rod photoreceptors. This was facilitated by a novel sample immobilization technique that we name heat-assisted rapid dehydration (HARD), wherein a thin layer of rod synaptic terminals (spherules) was transferred onto glass coverslips from fresh retinal slices. Rod ribbon AZs were readily immunolabeled and imaged in 3D with a precision of a few nanometers. Our 3D-MINFLUX results indicate that the SV release site in rods is a molecular complex of bassoon-RIM2-ubMunc13-2-Ca},

  abstract = {Walking capacity measured by a treadmill test (TT) reflects the patient's maximal capacity in a controlled setting and is part of the physical exercise capacity (PEC). Daily physical activity (PA) is defined as the total of actively freely produced movements per day. A lower PA level has been increasingly recognized as a strong predictor of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with intermittent claudication (IC). Recent insights suggested that an increased PEC does not automatically lead to an increase in daily PA. However, the precise relation between PEC and PA in patients with IC is still unclear. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the association between several PEC outcomes and PA in a general IC population. PEC was determined by well-established tests (Gardner-Skinner TT, a physical performance battery, a timed up-and-go test, and a 6-minute walk test distance). PA was obtained during 7 consecutive days using a triaxial accelerometer (Dynaport MoveMonitor; McRoberts BV, The Hague, The Netherlands). Five PA components (lying, sitting, standing, shuffling, and locomotion) and four parameters (total duration, number of periods, mean duration per period, and mean movement intensity per period) were analysed. Correlation coefficients between PEC and PA components were calculated. Data of 46 patients were available for analysis. Patients were sedentary (sitting and lying) during 81% of the day and were physically active (standing, shuffling, and locomotion) for the remaining 19% of the time. Correlations between PEC outcomes and PA ranged from very weak (0.025) to moderate (0.663). Moderate correlations (as therefore assumed to be relevant) were only found for outcomes of both the TT and 6-minute walk test and the locomotion components of PA. For instance, functional claudication distance (measured by TT) and number of steps per day correlated reasonably well (Spearman correlation ρ = 0.663; P < .01). Exercise capacity and PA correlate minimally in patients with IC. PA may be preferred as a novel outcome measure and future treatment target in patients with IC.},

  abstract = {Maternal smoking and stress during pregnancy are associated with adverse health effects for women themselves and are risk factors for adverse developmental outcomes of the unborn child. Smoking and stress seem to be intertwined in various ways. First, the majority of smoking pregnant women is of lower socio-economic status, which is associated with higher levels of perceived stress. Second, smoking women often report to smoke because they feel stressed. Third, quitting smoking often increases perceived stress levels initially. Therefore, effective interventions are needed to support women with smoking cessation by reducing stress. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention on stress reduction and smoking cessation. The Stress- and Smoke Free Start of Life (SSFSL) study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a personalized eHealth intervention with a control condition. Inclusion criteria for the women are: (1) > 18 years of age, (2) < 28 weeks pregnant at recruitment, (3) currently smoking. Consenting participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Participants allocated to the intervention group will receive an 8-week intervention delivered on their smartphone. The application includes psycho-education on pregnancy, stress, and smoking (cessation); stress-management training consisting of Heart Rate Variability-biofeedback; and a personalized stop-smoking-plan. Participants in the control condition will be invited to visit a webpage with information on pregnancy, stress, and smoking (cessation). Study outcomes will be collected via online questionnaires, at four timepoints: pre-intervention (baseline; t0), post-intervention (8 weeks + 1 day after t0; t1), follow up at two weeks after birth (t2), and follow up at three months after birth (t3). The primary outcome measure is self-reported smoking cessation. Secondary outcomes include daily self-reported number of cigarettes smoked, perceived stress, pregnancy experience, birth outcomes, and negative affectivity scores of the baby. Moreover, the mediating effect of stress reduction on smoking cessation will be examined, and possible moderators will be tested. If the eHealth intervention is effective in smoking cessation among pregnant smoking women, it can be implemented as a tool into the health care in the Netherlands.

Application of the FRASE assay revealed HSA in brain homogenates of presymptomatic HD transgenic and knockin mice and its progressive increase with phenotypic changes, suggesting that HSA quantitatively tracks disease progression. Biochemical investigations of mouse brain homogenates demonstrated that small, rather than large, mHTT structures are responsible for the HSA measured in FRASE assays. Finally, we assessed the neurotoxicity of mHTT seeds in an inducible Drosophila model transgenic for HTTex1. We found a strong correlation between the HSA measured in adult neurons and the increased mortality of transgenic HD flies, indicating that FRASE assays detect disease-relevant, neurotoxic, mHTT structures with severe phenotypic consequences in vivo.},

The aim of this study is to present three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of histology images. En-bloc specimens of transurethral bladder tumour resections were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. Specimens were cut into sections of 4 μm and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). With a Phillips IntelliSite UltraFast scanner, glass slides were digitized at 20x magnification. The digital images were aligned by performing rigid and affine image alignment. The tumour and the muscularis propria (MP) were manually delineated to create 3D segmentations. In conjunction with a 3D display, the results were visualized with the Vesalius3D interactive visualization application for a 3D workstation. En-bloc resection was performed in 21 BCa patients. Per case, 26-30 sections were included for the reconstruction into a 3D volume. Five cases were excluded due to export problems, size of the dataset or condition of the tissue block. Qualitative evaluation suggested an accurate registration for 13 out of 16 cases. The segmentations allowed full 3D visualization and evaluation of the spatial relationship of the BCa tumour and the MP. Digital scanning of en-bloc resected specimens allows a full-fledged 3D reconstruction and analysis and has a potential role to support pathologists in the staging of BCa.},

Understanding patients' and physicians' perspectives on compassionate care may provide insights that can be used to foster physicians' ability to respond to patients' compassion needs. Therefore, this study aims to understand how both patients and physicians experience the concept and practice of compassionate care. We conducted semi-structured interviews with eight patients and ten resident physicians at a University Medical Center in the Netherlands. Using thematic analysis, we separately coded patient and resident transcripts to identify themes capturing their experiences of compassionate care. This study was part of a larger project to develop an educational intervention to improve compassion in residents. For both patients and residents, we identified four themes encompassing compassionate care: being there, empathizing, actions to relieve patients' suffering, and connection. For residents, a fifth theme was professional fulfillment (resulting from compassionate care). Although patients and residents both emphasized the importance of compassionate care, patients did not always perceive the physician-patient encounter as compassionate. According to residents, high workloads and time pressures hindered their ability to provide compassionate care. Patients and residents have similar and varying understandings of compassionate care at the same time. Understanding these differences can aid compassion in medical practice. Based on the findings, three topics are suggested to improve compassion in residents: (1) train residents how to ask for patients' compassion needs, (2) address residents' limiting beliefs about the concept and practice of compassion, and (3) acknowledge the art and science of medicine cannot be separated.},

  abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research to reveal the localization of a broad scale of compounds ranging from metabolites to proteins in diseased tissues, such as malignant tumors. MSI is most commonly used for the two-dimensional imaging of tissues from multiple patients or for the three-dimensional (3D) imaging of tissue from a single patient. These applications are potentially introducing a sampling bias on a sample or patient level, respectively. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the consequences of sampling bias on sample representativeness and on the precision of biomarker discovery for histological grading of human bladder cancers by MSI. We therefore submitted formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 14 bladder cancer patients with varying histological grades to 3D analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MSI. We found that, after removing 20% of the data based on novel outlier detection routines for 3D-MSI data based on the evaluation of digestion efficacy and z-directed regression, on average 33% of a sample has to be measured in order to obtain sufficient coverage of the existing biological variance within a tissue sample. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, 3D MALDI-MSI is applied for the first time on a cohort of bladder cancer patients using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue of bladder cancer resections. This work portrays the reproducibility that can be achieved when employing an optimized sample preparation and subsequent data evaluation approach. Our data shows the influence of sampling bias on the variability of the results, especially for a small patient cohort. Furthermore, the presented data analysis workflow can be used by others as a 3D FFPE data-analysis pipeline working on multi-patient 3D-MSI studies.},

Thirteen aortic segments were dilated and the luminal surfaces perfused. These perfusates were investigated for their vasomotor action per se and analyzed for their concentrations of potassium and endothelin-like immunoreactivity (ET-LI). The perfusates from angioplasty segments caused a contraction of 2.4 +/- 0.8 mN, while the perfusates from control segments only resulted in a contraction of 0.4 +/- 0.2 mN, (P = 0.004). There was no difference in the concentrations of potassium or ET-LI in the perfusates. Thirty aortic segments were used to measure the concentration of ET-LI in extractions of untreated, control, and angioplasty specimens. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the angioplasty segments to be denuded of their endothelium. In conclusion, perfusates from rabbit aortic segments treated by angioplasty in vitro have a strong vasoconstricting effect, for which neither endothelin nor potassium seems to be responsible.},

While previous studies focused on the perspective of supervisor-resident relationships in residents' help-seeking decisions, attention for how the workplace environment and, more specifically, other health care team members influence these decisions is limited. Using a sociocultural lens, this study aimed to explore how residents' decision-making processes to seek help are shaped by their workplace environment. Through a constructivist grounded theory methodology, we purposively and theoretically sampled 18 residents: 9 juniors (postgraduate year 1/2) and 9 seniors (postgraduate year 5/6) at Amsterdam University Medical Centers. Using semi-structured interviews, participating residents' decision-making processes to seek help during patient care delivery were explored. Data collection and analysis were iterative; themes were identified using constant comparative analysis. Residents described their help-seeking decision-making processes as an 'act of performance': they considered how asking for help could potentially impact their assessments. They described this act of performance as the product of an internal 'balancing act' with at its core the non-negotiable priority for providing safe and high-quality patient care. With this in mind, residents weighed up demonstrating the ability to work independently, maintaining credibility and becoming an accepted member of the health care team when deciding to seek help. This 'balancing act' was influenced by sociocultural characteristics of the learning environment, residents' relationships with supervisors and the perceived approachability of other health care team members. This study suggests that sociocultural forces influence residents to experience help-seeking as an act of performance. Especially, a safe learning environment resulting from constructive relationships with supervisors and the approachability of other health care team members lowered the barriers to seek help. Supervisors could address these barriers by having regular conversations with residents about when to seek help.},

Given the availability of flexible software for analyzing longitudinal sequences of unequal length, implementation of likelihood-based MAR analyses is not limited by computational considerations. While such analyses are valid under the comparatively weak assumption of MAR, the possibility of data missing not at random (MNAR) is difficult to rule out. It is argued, however, that MNAR analyses are, themselves, surrounded with problems and therefore, rather than ignoring MNAR analyses altogether or blindly shifting to them, their optimal place is within sensitivity analysis. The concepts developed here are illustrated using data from three clinical trials, where it is shown that the analysis method may have an impact on the conclusions of the study.},

CSF contains hundreds of proteins, with concentrations reflecting ongoing (patho)physiological processes. This provides the opportunity to study many biological processes at the same time in patients. We studied whether Alzheimer's disease biological subtypes can be detected in CSF proteomics using the dual clustering technique non-negative matrix factorization. In two independent cohorts (EMIF-AD MBD and ADNI) we found that 705 (77% of 911 tested) proteins differed between Alzheimer's disease (defined as having abnormal amyloid, n = 425) and controls (defined as having normal CSF amyloid and tau and normal cognition, n = 127). Using these proteins for data-driven clustering, we identified three robust pathophysiological Alzheimer's disease subtypes within each cohort showing (i) hyperplasticity and increased BACE1 levels; (ii) innate immune activation; and (iii) blood-brain barrier dysfunction with low BACE1 levels. In both cohorts, the majority of individuals were labelled as having subtype 1 (80, 36% in EMIF-AD MBD; 117, 59% in ADNI), 71 (32%) in EMIF-AD MBD and 41 (21%) in ADNI were labelled as subtype 2, and 72 (32%) in EMIF-AD MBD and 39 (20%) individuals in ADNI were labelled as subtype 3. Genetic analyses showed that all subtypes had an excess of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (all P > 0.01). Additional pathological comparisons that were available for a subset in ADNI suggested that subtypes showed similar severity of Alzheimer's disease pathology, and did not differ in the frequencies of co-pathologies, providing further support that found subtypes truly reflect Alzheimer's disease heterogeneity. Compared to controls, all non-demented Alzheimer's disease individuals had increased risk of showing clinical progression (all P < 0.01). Compared to subtype 1, subtype 2 showed faster clinical progression after correcting for age, sex, level of education and tau levels (hazard ratio = 2.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 5.1; P = 0.01), and subtype 3 at trend level (hazard ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.0, 4.4; P = 0.06). Together, these results demonstrate the value of CSF proteomics in studying the biological heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease patients, and suggest that subtypes may require tailored therapy.},

Negative switching RSFPs are switched from the on- to the off-state with the same wavelength that also excites fluorescence. Positive switching RSFPs have a reversed light response, where the fluorescence excitation wavelength induces the transition from the off- to the on-state. Reversible saturable optical linear (fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT) nanoscopy utilizes these switching states to achieve diffraction-unlimited resolution but so far has primarily relied on negative switching RSFPs by using time sequential switching schemes. On the basis of the green fluorescent RSFP Padron, we engineered the positive switching RSFP Padron2. Compared to its predecessor, it can undergo 50-fold more switching cycles while displaying a contrast ratio between the on- and the off-states of more than 100:1. Because of its robust switching behavior, Padron2 supports a RESOLFT imaging scheme that entirely refrains from sequential switching as it only requires beam scanning of two spatially overlaid light distributions. Using Padron2, we demonstrate live-cell RESOLFT nanoscopy without sequential illumination steps.},

With the introduction of digitization and whole-slide images of prostate biopsies, computer-aided grading becomes feasible. Computer-aided grading has the potential to improve histopathological grading and treatment selection for prostate cancer. Automated detection of GPs and determination of the grade groups (GG) using a convolutional neural network. In total, 96 prostate biopsies from 38 patients are annotated on pixel-level. Automated detection of GP 3 and GP ≥ 4 in digitized prostate biopsies is performed by re-training the Inception-v3 convolutional neural network (CNN). The outcome of the CNN is subsequently converted into probability maps of GP ≥ 3 and GP ≥ 4, and the GG of the whole biopsy is obtained according to these probability maps. Differentiation between non-atypical and malignant (GP ≥ 3) areas resulted in an accuracy of 92% with a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 93%, respectively. The differentiation between GP ≥ 4 and GP ≤ 3 was accurate for 90%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 77 and 94%, respectively. Concordance of our automated GG determination method with a genitourinary pathologist was obtained in 65% (κ = 0.70), indicating substantial agreement. A CNN allows for accurate differentiation between non-atypical and malignant areas as defined by GPs, leading to a substantial agreement with the pathologist in defining the GG.},

  abstract = {The rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque cap overlying a lipid pool and/or necrotic core can lead to thrombotic cardiovascular events. In essence, the rupture of the plaque cap is a mechanical event, which occurs when the local stress exceeds the local tissue strength. However, due to inter- and intra-cap heterogeneity, the resulting ultimate cap strength varies, causing proper assessment of the plaque at risk of rupture to be lacking. Important players involved in tissue strength include the load-bearing collagenous matrix, macrophages, as major promoters of extracellular matrix degradation, and microcalcifications, deposits that can exacerbate local stress, increasing tissue propensity for rupture. This review summarizes the role of these components individually in tissue mechanics, along with the interplay between them. We argue that to be able to improve risk assessment, a better understanding of the effect of these individual components, as well as their reciprocal relationships on cap mechanics, is required. Finally, we discuss potential future steps, including a holistic multidisciplinary approach, multifactorial 3D in vitro model systems, and advancements in imaging techniques. The obtained knowledge will ultimately serve as input to help diagnose, prevent, and treat atherosclerotic cap rupture.},

In response, research efforts are being devoted to the development of tools that assess the sensitivity of such models to often strong but always, at least in part, unverifiable assumptions. Many efforts have been devoted to longitudinal data, primarily in the selection model context, although some researchers have expressed interest in the pattern-mixture setting as well. A promising tool, proposed by Verbeke et al. (2001, Biometrics 57, 43-50), is based on local influence (Cook, 1986, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 48, 133-169). These authors considered the Diggle and Kenward (1994, Applied Statistics 43, 49-93) model, which is based on a selection model, integrating a linear mixed model for continuous outcomes with logistic regression for dropout. In this article, we show that a similar idea can be developed for multivariate and longitudinal binary data, subject to nonmonotone missingness. We focus on the model proposed by Baker, Rosenberger, and DerSimonian (1992, Statistics in Medicine 11, 643-657). The original model is first extended to allow for (possibly continuous) covariates, whereafter a local influence strategy is developed to support the model-building process. The model is able to deal with nonmonotone missingness but has some limitations as well, stemming from the conditional nature of the model parameters. Some analytical insight is provided into the behavior of the local influence graphs.},

Data of patients undergoing a transurethral resection of a bladder tumor between 2000 and 2018 at a Dutch academic medical center were selected. Corresponding histological slides were digitized. A three-step approach was used to predict 1- and 5-yr recurrence-free survival. First, a segmentation network was used to detect the urothelium on the digital histopathology slides. Second, a selection network was trained for the selection of patches associated with recurrence. Third, a classification network, combining the information of the selection network with clinical data, was trained to give the probability of 1- and 5-yr recurrence-free survival. The accuracy of the deep learning-based model was compared with a multivariable logistic regression model using clinical data only. In the 1- and 5-yr follow-up cohorts, 359 and 281 patients were included with recurrence rates of 27% and 63%, respectively. The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the model combining digital histopathology slide data with clinical data were 0.62 and 0.76 for 1- and 5-yr recurrence predictions, respectively, which were higher than those of the model using digital histopathology slide data only (AUCs of 0.56 and 0.72, respectively) and the multivariable logistic regression (AUCs of 0.58 and 0.57, respectively). In our population, the deep learning-based model combining digital histopathology slides and clinical data enhances the prediction of recurrence (within 5 yr) compared with models using clinical data or image data only. By combining histopathology images and patient record data using deep learning, the prediction of recurrence in bladder cancer patients is enhanced.},

The CCAN protein CENP-C is thought to be a central hub for the centromere/kinetochore organization. However, the role of CENP-C in CCAN assembly needs to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that both the CCAN-binding domain and the C-terminal region that includes the Cupin domain of CENP-C are necessary and sufficient for chicken CENP-C function. Structural and biochemical analyses reveal self-oligomerization of the Cupin domains of chicken and human CENP-C. We find that the CENP-C Cupin domain oligomerization is vital for CENP-C function, centromeric localization of CCAN, and centromeric chromatin organization. These results suggest that CENP-C facilitates the centromere/kinetochore assembly through its oligomerization.},

Search terms included "dementia", "long-term care institutions", "NPS", "longitudinal", and additional related terms. All titles and abstracts were independently assessed for inclusion and for methodological quality by two researchers, and the full texts of relevant papers were retrieved. Inclusion criteria were: dementia diagnosis, long-term care institutions, NPS, and longitudinal design. The literature search revealed 1982 papers of which 18 met the inclusion criteria. The patients were predominately female and aged 75 years and over. The follow-up period ranged from three months to one year. The number of assessments ranged from two to five, and 12 different assessment instruments were used to study NPS. Aberrant motor behavior, depression, anxiety, and euphoria showed decline over time, and psychosis remained constant whereas apathy, agitation, irritability, and disinhibition increased over time. All symptoms showed specific intermittent courses. The methodological quality of the literature was limited by the small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, and lack of comprehensive neuropsychiatric assessment instruments. In the reviewed studies, NPS in institutionalized residents with dementia showed a heterogeneous course, although methodological limitations and the diversity of the studies call for caution in interpretation. Future research should focus on large prospective cohort studies with institutionalized residents with dementia, examining a wide range of NPS.},

The nonionic contrast medium, iohexol, inhibits vasoactive substances to a lesser extent than ionic contrast media. Iohexol inhibited the action of vasoconstrictors in a way that raised suspicion of a calcium antagonistic effect of the medium. The authors test this hypothesis by comparing the inhibitory effect of iohexol with the inhibitory effect of a calcium antagonist (nifedipine). The vasoconstrictors were KCl, which depends on potential-operated calcium channels, and histamine, endothelin-1, and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), which depend on receptor-operated calcium channels. Segments of rabbit coronary arteries were mounted between two L-shaped prongs in tissue baths containing calcium-free buffer, calcium-free buffer with 10(-8) M nifedipine, or iohexol. One of the vasoconstrictors, KCl, histamine, endothelin-1, or PGF2 alpha, was added to induce a level of activation. Thereafter, increasing concentrations of CaCl2 were added in a stepwise manner, and the contractile responses of the vessel segments were recorded. Addition of CaCl2 caused concentration-dependent vasoconstrictions in the buffer. The effect of adding CaCl2 was inhibited in the buffer with nifedipine and in iohexol when the vessels were activated with histamine, endothelin-1, or PGF2 alpha. When the vessels were activated with the potential-operated calcium channel-dependent vasoconstrictor, KCl, the effect of adding CaCl2 was inhibited in the buffer with nifedipine but not in iohexol. In vitro, iohexol had the same effect as the calcium antagonist nifedipine on the action of receptor-operated calcium channel-dependent vasoconstrictors. This suggests a calcium antagonistic effect of iohexol on the action of the ROC.},

  abstract = {The APOE ε2 and APOE ε4 alleles are the strongest protective and risk-increasing, respectively, genetic variants for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the mechanisms linking APOE to AD-particularly the apoE protein's role in AD pathogenesis and how this is affected by APOE variants-remain poorly understood. Identifying missense variants in addition to APOE ε2 and APOE ε4 could provide critical new insights, but given the low frequency of additional missense variants, AD genetic cohorts have previously been too small to interrogate this question robustly. To determine whether rare missense variants on APOE are associated with AD risk. Association with case-control status was tested in a sequenced discovery sample (stage 1) and followed up in several microarray imputed cohorts as well as the UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing resource using a proxy-AD phenotype (stages 2 and 3). This study combined case-control, family-based, population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts that recruited referred and volunteer participants. Stage 1 included 37 409 nonunique participants of European or admixed European ancestry, with 11 868 individuals with AD and 11 934 controls passing analysis inclusion criteria. In stages 2 and 3, 475 473 participants were considered across 8 cohorts, of which 84 513 individuals with AD and proxy-AD and 328 372 controls passed inclusion criteria. Selection criteria were cohort specific, and this study was performed a posteriori on individuals who were genotyped. Among the available genotypes, 76 195 were excluded. All data were retrieved between September 2015 and November 2021 and analyzed between April and November 2021. In primary analyses, the AD risk associated with each missense variant was estimated, as appropriate, with either linear mixed-model regression or logistic regression. In secondary analyses, associations were estimated with age at onset using linear mixed-model regression and risk of conversion to AD using competing-risk regression. A total of 544 384 participants were analyzed in the primary case-control analysis; 312 476 (57.4%) were female, and the mean (SD; range) age was 64.9 (15.2; 40-110) years. Two missense variants were associated with a 2-fold to 3-fold decreased AD risk: APOE ε4 (R251G) (odds ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.33-0.59; P = 4.7 × 10-8) and APOE ε3 (V236E) (odds ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.25-0.56; P = 1.9 × 10-6). Additionally, the cumulative incidence of AD in carriers of these variants was found to grow more slowly with age compared with noncarriers. In this genetic association study, a novel variant associated with AD was identified: R251G always coinherited with ε4 on the APOE gene, which mitigates the ε4-associated AD risk. The protective effect of the V236E variant, which is always coinherited with ε3 on the APOE gene, was also confirmed. The location of these variants confirms that the carboxyl-terminal portion of apoE plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. The large risk reductions reported here suggest that protein chemistry and functional assays of these variants should be pursued, as they have the potential to guide drug development targeting APOE.},

This study evaluates a contrast medium-induced vasoconstriction that occurs when isolated arteries are exposed directly to a CM. Segments of rabbit coronary arteries were mounted in tissue baths containing buffer solution. During the experiments the buffer solution was exchanged with iohexol iso-osmolar with plasma, which caused a temporary vasoconstriction of the vessel segments. The constriction did not depend on the degree of oxygenation of iohexol. The endothelium was not involved in the vasoconstriction. Prazosin slightly decreased the vasoconstriction and a small part of the constriction might thus depend on liberation of norepinephrine by iohexol. The constriction was totally inhibited by the calcium antagonist nifedipine, while it was augmented by addition of low concentrations of KCl to ihoexol. It is concluded that the otherwise safe CM iohexol causes vasoconstriction in vitro by depolarizing the smooth muscle cells and the nerve terminals in the vessel wall.},

  abstract = {Vasodilation is a well-known side effect of contrast media (CM) that is primarily explained by the hyperosmolality of the media. Few reports have dealt with the influences of chemotoxicity and ion toxicity on vessel tone. We compared the effects of solutions iso-osmolar to plasma of iohexol (nonionic monomer), ioxaglate (ionic dimer), diatrizoate (ionic monomer), and mannitol on responses to vasoconstrictors (potassium chloride [KCl], histamine, and endothelin-1). The aim of this study was to investigate if differences in chemotoxicity and ion toxicity could contribute to the changes in vessel tone seen clinically during arteriography. Segments of rabbit coronary arteries were mounted between two L-shaped prongs in tissue baths with buffer solution or CM solutions. Their responses to increasing concentrations of a vasoconstrictor were measured. The maximal contraction of the vasoconstrictor (Emax) and the concentration of the vasoconstrictor causing half maximal contraction (EC50) were calculated. Iohexol caused the same changes as the nonionic solution of mannitol. The media reduced the actions of KCl, histamine, and endothelin-1 to 50% to 60% of their action in buffer. The ionic CM, ioxaglate and diatrizoate, caused a more pronounced inhibition of histamine and almost totally inhibited the action of KCl. The action of endothelin-1 was inhibited to a greater extent by iohexol and mannitol than by ioxaglate and diatrizoate. Different types of iso-osmolar CM interact differently with vasoconstrictors. These effects are caused by differences in chemo- and ion toxicity. These interactions might contribute to the differences in vasodilatation found clinically.},

Zoledronic acid (0.5 mg kg Long-term treatment with zoledronic acid reduced the number of jaw bone marrow cells, without affecting the number of long bone marrow cells. Zoledronic acid treatment did not affect the number of osteoclasts in vivo. Yet, the bisphosphonate increased bone volume and mineral density of both long bone and jaw. Interestingly, 6 months of treatment suppressed bone formation in the long bones without affecting the jaw. Unexpectedly, we showed that bisphosphonates can cause molar root resorption, mediated by active osteoclasts. Our findings provide more insight into bone-site-specific effects of bisphosphonates and into the aetiology of osteonecrosis of the jaw. We demonstrated that bisphosphonates can stimulate osteoclast activity at the molar roots.},

Women and men had a 31.4% and 23.7% incidence of PDPH, respectively; these were not significantly different (P = 0.38).  Neither were rates of PDPH in Caucasians (28.0%) and African-Americans (15.6%) significantly different (P = 0.18)   Healthy controls had a higher incidence of PDPH than patients with PTSD (P = 0.032).  Smokers had a lower incidence of PDPH than non-smokers, 13.7% vs. 34.1% (P = 0.009).    This was not a prospective study, rather a retrospective chart review.    Most notably, smokers had a considerably reduced rate of PDPH in comparison with non-smokers.  This information could be a useful addition to the clinical assessment of relative risk for PDPH.  Further research into the mechanisms by which tobacco smoking may inhibit PDPH, such as nicotine stimulation of dopamine neurotransmission or alterations in coagulation, appears warranted.},

The slides were digitized, and the urothelium was annotated by expert observers. The U-Net-based segmentation network was trained to automatically detect urothelium. This detection was used as input for the classification network. The classification network aimed to grade the tumors according to the World Health Organization grading system adopted in 2004. The automated grading was compared with the consensus and individual grading. The segmentation network resulted in an accurate detection of urothelium. The automated grading shows moderate agreement (κ = 0.48 ± 0.14 SEM) with the consensus reading. The agreement among pathologists ranges between fair (κ = 0.35 ± 0.13 SEM and κ = 0.38 ± 0.11 SEM) and moderate (κ = 0.52 ± 0.13 SEM). The automated classification correctly graded 76% of the low-grade cancers and 71% of the high-grade cancers according to the consensus reading. These results indicate that deep learning can be used for the fully automated detection and grading of urothelial cell carcinoma.},

People with limited health literacy constitute a vulnerable group that might have difficulty accessing, understanding and applying health information, particularly in times of crisis. This study explored (a) key aspects of crisis communication and (b) explicit consideration of people's health literacy needs in communication to people with RMDs during the first wave of COVID-19 in the Netherlands. We conducted a convergent, qualitatively driven mixed-methods study comprising seven qualitative interviews with professional representatives of organisations responsible for information provision to people with RMDs, and quantitative analysis of 15 patient information materials distributed by these organisations. The study was guided by principles of crisis communication and health literacy. We assessed understandability and actionability of information materials using the Dutch version of the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT, resulting in a percentage of quality criteria met), and language difficulty level using an online application (assessing difficult words, jargon, passive, complex and long sentences, long paragraphs, and difficulty levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR, from A1 (basic) to C2 (proficient))). Respondents reported lack of preparedness, challenges related to scientific uncertainty and reaching the target group, difficulty simplifying information, and uncertainty regarding adequacy of the communication approach. Patient information materials (written and video) showed variation in actionability (range 60-100%) and understandability (range 58-100%), and 69% of written materials were too difficult, mostly due to the use of long sentences and difficult words. The quantitative findings were in coherence with the limitations in communication reported by respondents. Several potential improvements were formulated in 'lessons learned'. Although rheumatology organisations mostly adhered to principles of crisis communication and made efforts to adapt information to their audience's needs, we propose recommendations to improve preparedness, strategy, content, reach and consideration of health literacy needs in future crisis communication.},

Once considered to be a disease of the apocrine glands, it is actually a defect of follicular epithelium. Thus, the term hidradenitis suppurativa is a misnomer and should be abandoned. In cases of familial acne inversa, the pattern of transmission and number of affected individuals are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Aetiological factors such as hyperandrogenism, obesity, smoking and chemical irritants are not consistently associated with the affection. Bacterial involvement is not a primary event in acne inversa, but is secondary to the disease process. Potential complications include dermal contraction, local or systemic infection due to the spread of microorganisms, systemic amyloidosis, arthropathy, and squamous cell carcinoma. As spontaneous resolution is rare and progressive disability is the rule, early definitive surgical intervention is advisable. The surgical procedure of choice in most cases is wide local excision and healing by secondary intention. Pharmacotherapeutic drugs, including synthetic retinoids and antiandrogens, do not prevent progression of the disease.},

The degeneration is thought to be mediated by inflammatory processes occurring in the tissue of the joint, including the cartilage. Intra-articular administered triamcinolone acetonide (TAA) is one of the drug treatments employed to ameliorate the inflammation and pain that characterizes OA. However, the penetration and distribution of TAA into the avascular cartilage is not well understood. We employed matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which has been previously used to directly monitor the distribution of drugs in biological tissues, to evaluate the distribution of TAA in human cartilage after in vitro incubation. Unfortunately, TAA is not easily ionized by regular electrospray ionization (ESI) or MALDI. To overcome this problem, we developed an on-tissue derivatization method with Girard's reagent T (GirT) in human incubated cartilage being able to study its distribution and quantify the drug abundance (up to 3.3 ng/μL). Our results demonstrate the depth of penetration of a corticosteroid drug in human OA cartilage using MALDI-MSI.},

There is mixed evidence from cohort studies that young children exposed to anaesthesia can have an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. We aimed to establish whether general anaesthesia in infancy has any effect on neurodevelopmental outcome. Here we report the secondary outcome of neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age in the General Anaesthesia compared to Spinal anaesthesia (GAS) trial. In this international assessor-masked randomised controlled equivalence trial, we recruited infants younger than 60 weeks postmenstrual age, born at greater than 26 weeks' gestation, and who had inguinal herniorrhaphy, from 28 hospitals in Australia, Italy, the USA, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either awake-regional anaesthesia or sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia. Web-based randomisation was done in blocks of two or four and stratified by site and gestational age at birth. Infants were excluded if they had existing risk factors for neurological injury. The primary outcome of the trial will be the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient score at age 5 years. The secondary outcome, reported here, is the composite cognitive score of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III, assessed at 2 years. The analysis was as per protocol adjusted for gestational age at birth. A difference in means of five points (1/3 SD) was predefined as the clinical equivalence margin. This trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516 and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00756600. Between Feb 9, 2007, and Jan 31, 2013, 363 infants were randomly assigned to receive awake-regional anaesthesia and 359 to general anaesthesia. Outcome data were available for 238 children in the awake-regional group and 294 in the general anaesthesia group. In the as-per-protocol analysis, the cognitive composite score (mean [SD]) was 98.6 (14.2) in the awake-regional group and 98.2 (14.7) in the general anaesthesia group. There was equivalence in mean between groups (awake-regional minus general anaesthesia 0.169, 95% CI -2.30 to 2.64). The median duration of anaesthesia in the general anaesthesia group was 54 min. For this secondary outcome, we found no evidence that just less than 1 h of sevoflurane anaesthesia in infancy increases the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age compared with awake-regional anaesthesia.

  abstract = {Target-controlled infusion (TCI) technology has been available in most countries worldwide for clinical use in anesthesia for approximately 2 decades. This infusion mode uses pharmacokinetic models to calculate infusion rates necessary to reach and maintain the desired drug concentration. TCI is computationally more complex than traditional modes of drug administration. The primary difference between TCI and conventional infusions is that TCI decreases the infusion rate at regular intervals to account for the uptake of drug into saturable compartments. Although the calculated infusion rates are consistent with manually controlled infusion rates, there are concerns that TCI administration of IV anesthetics could introduce unique safety concerns. After approximately 2 decades of clinical use, it is appropriate to assess the safety of TCI. Our aim in this article was to describe safety-relevant issues related to TCI, which should have emerged after its use in millions of patients. We collected information from published medical literature, TCI manufacturers, and publicly available governmental Web sites to find evidence of safety issues with the clinical use of TCI. Although many case reports emphasize that IV anesthesia is technically more demanding than inhaled anesthesia, including human errors associated with setting up IV infusions, no data suggest that a TCI mode of drug delivery introduces unique safety issues other than selecting the wrong pharmacokinetic model. This is analogous to the risk of selecting the wrong drug with current infusion pumps. We found no evidence that TCI is not at least as safe as anesthetic administration using constant rate infusions.},

Secondary objectives were to characterize the pharmacokinetics of ABP-700 and its primary metabolite (cyclopropyl-methoxycarbonyl acid), to assess the clinical effects of ABP-700, and to investigate the dose-response and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships. Sixty subjects were divided into 10 cohorts and received an increasing, single bolus of either ABP-700 or placebo. Safety was assessed by clinical laboratory evaluations, infusion-site reactions, continuous monitoring of vital signs, physical examination, adverse event monitoring, and adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation testing. Clinical effects were assessed with modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation and Bispectral Index monitoring. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated. Stopping criteria were met at 1.00 mg/kg dose. No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse events were dose-dependent and comprised involuntary muscle movement, tachycardia, and ventilatory effects. Adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation evoked a physiologic cortisol response in all subjects, no different from placebo. Pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional. A three-compartment pharmacokinetic model described the data well. A rapid onset of anesthesia/sedation after bolus administration and also a rapid recovery were observed. A quantitative concentration-effect relationship was described for the modified observer's assessment of alertness/sedation and Bispectral Index. This first-in-human study of ABP-700 shows that ABP-700 was safe and well tolerated after single-bolus injections up to 1.00 mg/kg. Bolus doses of 0.25 and 0.35 mg/kg were found to provide the most beneficial clinical effect versus side-effect profile.},

  abstract = {The primary aim of this pilot study was to determine whether the dexmedetomidine infusion initiated immediately after laparoscopic bariatric surgery, offers an advantage over a morphine infusion with respect to rescue morphine and paracetamol requirements over the first 24 post-operative hours. Sixty morbidly obese adult patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of either 0.3 mcg/kg/h dexmedetomidine (Group D) or 3 mg/h Morphine (Group M) for 24 h immediately post-operatively. All patients received standardized general anesthesia and were evaluated and treated for pain in the intensive care unit by providers who were blinded to their treatment group. The primary outcome was the need for supplemental, "rescue" paracetamol (Dolargan. Hikma, Jordan) and morphine titrated to achieve visual analog scales (VAS) of <40 and <70, respectively. A total of 60 patients (77 % female, mean age 33.5 years ± 9.5 and body mass index (BMI) 43.0 ± 4.5) were randomized to Group M and 30 to Group D. There were no significant differences in mean rescue paracetamol and morphine requirements. Mean total morphine requirements in Group D were 6.1 ± 3.1 mg, whereas 72.9 ± 2.2 mg in Group M (p < 0.0001). An intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine, initiated and continued for 24 h following laparoscopic bariatric surgery, can decrease the overall morphine requirements during this period. This pilot study demonstrated that the post-operative initiation of dexmedetomidine can be morphine sparing following laparoscopic bariatric surgery.},

It is not clear if these findings apply to humans, and retrospective epidemiological studies thus far have failed to show definitive evidence that anesthetic agents are harmful to the developing human brain. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the preclinical studies published over the past decade, with a focus on methodological issues, to facilitate the comparison between different preclinical studies and inform better design of future trials. The literature search identified 941 articles related to the topic of neurotoxicity. As the primary aim of this systematic review was to compare methodologies applied in animal studies to inform future trials, we excluded a priori all articles focused on putative mechanism of neurotoxicity and the neuroprotective agents. Forty-seven preclinical studies were finally included in this review. Methods used in these studies were highly heterogeneous-animals were exposed to anesthetic agents at different developmental stages, in various doses and in various combinations with other drugs, and overall showed diverse toxicity profiles. Physiological monitoring and maintenance of physiological homeostasis was variable and the use of cognitive tests was generally limited to assessment of specific brain areas, with restricted translational relevance to humans. Comparison between studies is thus complicated by this heterogeneous methodology and the relevance of the combined body of literature to humans remains uncertain. Future preclinical studies should use better standardized methodologies to facilitate transferability of findings from preclinical into clinical science.},

This study was part of a prospective cohort study focused on postoperative cognitive outcomes for patients 65 years of age or older undergoing surgery for a solid malignancy. Postoperative cognitive decline was defined as the change in the combined results of the Ruff Figural Fluency Test and the Trail-Making Test Parts A and B. Patients with the highest change in scores 2 weeks postoperatively compared with baseline were considered to be patients with cognitive decline. Patients with the lowest change were considered to be patients without cognitive decline. To analyze the effect of vitamin levels on the changes in postoperative cognitive scores, uni- and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. The study enrolled 61 patients with and 59 patients without postoperative cognitive decline. Hyperhomocysteinemia was present in 14.2% of the patients. Patients with postoperative cognitive decline more often had hyperhomocysteinemia (27.9 vs 10.2%). Hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with a higher chance for the development of postoperative cognitive decline (odds ratio Preoperative hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with the development of postoperative cognitive decline. The presence of preoperative hyperhomocysteinemia could be an indicator for an increased risk of postoperative cognitive decline developing in the elderly.},

  abstract = {In anaesthetic practice the risk of cerebral ischemic/hypoxic damage is thought to be attenuated by deep anaesthesia. The rationale is that deeper anaesthesia reduces cerebral oxygen demand more than light anaesthesia, thereby increasing the tolerance to ischemia or hypoxia. However, evidence to support this is scarce. We thus investigated the influence of light versus deep anaesthesia on the responses of rat brains to a period of hypoxia. In the first experiment we exposed adult male Wistar rats to deep or light propofol anaesthesia and then performed [18F]- Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans to verify the extent of cerebral metabolic suppression. In subsequent experiments, rats were subjected to light/deep propofol anaesthesia and then exposed to a period of hypoxia or ongoing normoxia (n = 9-11 per group). A further 5 rats, not exposed to anaesthesia or hypoxia, served as controls. Four days later a Novel Object Recognition (NOR) test was performed to assess mood and cognition. After another 4 days, the animals were sacrificed for later immunohistochemical analyses of neurogenesis/neuroplasticity (Doublecortin; DCX), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) expression and neuroinflammation (Ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein-1; Iba-1) in hippocampal and piriform cortex slices. The hippocampi of rats subjected to hypoxia during light anaesthesia showed lower DCX positivity, and therefore lower neurogenesis, but higher BDNF levels and microglia hyper-ramification. Exploration was reduced, but no significant effect on NOR was observed. In the piriform cortex, higher DCX positivity was observed, associated with neuroplasticity. All these effects were attenuated by deep anaesthesia. Deepening anaesthesia attenuated the brain changes associated with hypoxia. Hypoxia during light anaesthesia had a prolonged effect on the brain, but no impairment in cognitive function was observed. Although reduced hippocampal neurogenesis may be considered unfavourable, higher BDNF expression, associated with microglia hyper-ramification may suggest activation of repair mechanisms. Increased neuroplasticity observed in the piriform cortex supports this, and might reflect a prolonged state of alertness rather than damage.},

We included 207 women who underwent RRSO before menopausal age (52 years) attending the family cancer clinic of an academic hospital and 828 age-matched women from a general population cohort (PREVEND). Participants filled out a questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and medical history, had anthropometric measurements and provided blood samples for assessment of serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol. The correlation between RRSO and cholesterol profile was assessed with logistic regression. Furthermore, subgroup analyses were performed to explore a possible effect of age at and time since RRSO. At a median time of 5.9 years (range 2.3-25.2) after surgery, RRSO was associated with low (< 60 mg/dl) HDL-cholesterol (OR 9.74, 95% CI 5.19-18.26) and high (≥ 160 mg/dl) non-HDL-cholesterol (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.21-2.82) when adjusting for body mass index, hormone therapy, participation on sports and previous chemotherapy. The observed association was not dependent on age or time since RRSO. The RRSO group had less smokers (19.3 vs. 25.8%) and more participation on sports (45.4 vs. 22.0%). Our results suggest that RRSO is associated with a more atherogenic cholesterol profile, despite a lower prevalence of smoking and higher prevalence of participation on sports as compared to controls. This observation can be useful for physicians involved in the counselling and follow-up of women having RRSO.},

A search in Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus was performed to identify studies that used the USFD and were published between 01-10-2003 and 22-03-2015. We also searched in Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus for all publications that cited the two publications containing the original ILCOR advisory statement introducing and recommending the USFD. In total we identified 14 publications by groups that explicitly used elements of the USFD for collecting and reporting their data. Of the 22 core and 19 supplemental USFD parameters, 6-19 core (27-86%) and 1-12 (5-63%) supplemental parameters were used; two parameters (5%) have not been used in any publication. Associations with outcome were reported for nine core (41%) and five supplemental (26%) USFD parameters. The USFD publications also identified non-USFD parameters related to outcome: initial cardiac rhythm, time points and intervals during resuscitation, intubation at the drowning scene, first hospital core temperature, serum glucose and potassium, the use of inotropic/vasoactive agents and the Paediatric Index of Mortality 2-score. Fourteen USFD based drowning publications have been identified. These publications provide valuable information about the process and quality of drowning resuscitation and confirm that the USFD is helpful for a structured comparison of the outcome of drowning resuscitation.},

Our aim was to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model for remifentanil that is accurate in patients with a wide range of age and weight. Remifentanil pharmacokinetic data were obtained from three previously published studies of adults and children, one of which also contained pharmacodynamic data from adults. NONMEM was used to estimate allometrically scaled compartmental pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models. Weight, age, height, sex, and body mass index were explored as covariates. Predictive performance was measured across young children, children, young adults, middle-aged, and elderly. Overall, 2,634 remifentanil arterial concentration and 3,989 spectral-edge frequency observations from 131 individuals (55 male, 76 female) were analyzed. Age range was 5 days to 85 yr, weight range was 2.5 to 106 kg, and height range was 49 to 193 cm. The final pharmacokinetic model uses age, weight, and sex as covariates. Parameter estimates for a 35-yr-old, 70-kg male (reference individual) are: V1, 5.81 l; V2, 8.82 l; V3, 5.03 l; CL, 2.58 l/min; Q2, 1.72 l/min; and Q3, 0.124 l/min. Parameters mostly increased with fat-free mass and decreased with age. The pharmacodynamic model effect compartment rate constant (ke0) was 1.09 per minute (reference individual), which decreased with age. We developed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to predict remifentanil concentration and effect for a wide range of patient ages and weights. Performance exceeded the Minto model over a wide age and weight range.},

With an excess of 13-hydroperoxy-linoleate a labile purple-coloured enzyme species is formed which reverts to a yellow-coloured form with concomitant conversion of the hydroperoxy compound. In this reaction 13-hydroperoxy-linoleate isomerises into threo-11-hydroxy-trans-12:13 epoxy-9-cis-octadecenoic acid as could be concluded from nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectral data. Experiments with 13-[18O2]hydroperoxy-linoleate showed a high retention (70%) of the 2 hydroperoxy oxygen atoms in the end product.},

The addition of 13-L-hydroperoxylinoleic acid to lipoxygenase-1 at pH 9.0 gives rise to the appearance of EPR lines at g equals 7.5, 6.2, 5.9 and 2.0, and an increased signal at g equals 4.3. 3. In view of the effect of the end product on both the kinetic lag period of the aerobic reaction and the fluorescence of the enzyme, it is concluded that 13-L-hydroperoxylinoleic acid is required for the activation of soybean lipoxygenase-1. Thus it is proposed that the enzyme with iron in the ferric state is the active species. 4. A reaction scheme is presented in which the enzyme alternatingly exists in the ferric and ferrous states for both the aerobic and anaerobic reaction.},

A structured chart review over the 3-month period considerable time after implementation of the MHI guideline (study period) was compared with the 3-month-period before its introduction (control period). Both children and adults were included. Primary outcome measures were the percentage of hospital admissions and percentage of cerebrum CT scans in patients with MHI. Secondary outcome measures were traumatic findings on CT scan, neurosurgical intervention and adherence to the guideline. During the study and control periods, respectively 1063 and 1026 patients with MHI attended the emergency department of the study centre. During the study period a CT scan was carried out in 34.2% of patients, significantly more than in the control period 18.8%; p < 0.01). The percentage of admissions also increased from 13.8% to 18.2% (p = 0.01). The differences between the two periods were mainly in adults and in children aged 6 and older. There was no significant change in traumatic intracranial findings or neurosurgical interventions. Adherence to the guideline in regard to hospitalization (81.7% guideline adherence) and CT brain imaging (88.3% guideline adherence) was reasonably high. After introduction of the current MHI guideline in the Netherlands, percentages of both hospitalization and CT of cerebrum have increased significantly. It was expected that the guideline would result in decreases of this percentages. This increase does not seem to be related to more or serious head/brain injury.},

Studies included were published articles containing (1) primary research investigating the psychometric and clinimetrics of the PSFS or (2) the implementation of the PSFS as an outcome measure. We assessed the methodological quality of studies included in the first category. Two hundred forty-two articles published from 1994 to May 2010 were identified. Of these, 66 met the inclusion criteria for this review, with 13 reporting the measurement properties of the PSFS, 55 implementing the PSFS as an outcome measure, and 2 doing both of the above. The PSFS was reported to be valid, reliable, and responsive in populations with knee dysfunction, cervical radiculopathy, acute low back pain, mechanical low back pain, and neck dysfunction. The PSFS was found to be reliable and responsive in populations with chronic low back pain. The PSFS was also reported to be valid, reliable, or responsive in individuals with a limited number of acute, subacute, and chronic conditions. This review found that the PSFS is also being used as an outcome measure in many other conditions, despite a lack of published evidence supporting its validity in these conditions. Although the use of the PSFS as an outcome measure is increasing in physiotherapy practice, there are gaps in the research literature regarding its validity, reliability, and responsiveness in many health conditions.},

Prospective study. Clinical evaluation of a new method. Neurological intensive care unit of a university hospital. Ten patients with acute complete middle cerebral artery territory- or hemispheric infarctions. Two combined fiberoptic thermistor catheters were placed in the right jugular bulb and in the thoracic aorta. Central venous injections of ice-cold indocyanine green dye were performed. CBF was estimated by calculating the mean transit times of the cold bolus and dye. A total of 104 reproducible CBF measurements were obtained. No complications associated with the method were observed. Twelve pairs of measurements were performed within 30 mins with unchanged clinical conditions. The standard deviation of repeated measurements was 2.7 mL/100 g/min; the interrater reliability was between 0.95 and 0.99. The median CBF in patients who died (n = 4) was lower (27 mL/100g/min) than in those who survived (n = 6) (45 mL/100g/ min). Patients who died more frequently had low CBF values of <30 mL/100g/min (22 of 38; 58%) than patients who survived (10 of 54; 19%). A total of 37 CBF measurements were done during ICP elevation of >20 mm Hg. In patients who survived, ICP elevations were only associated with low CBF values in 5 of 26 events; whereas in patients who died, ICP elevations were associated with low CBF values in 8 of 11 events. The new double indicator dilution technique may be suitable for serial bedside CBF measurement. It is easy to perform and can be rapidly repeated in the ICU environment. Validation of the method by comparison with standard methods is needed. The preliminary data indicate that bedside monitoring of CBF may give prognostic information for outcome and may guide therapy of elevated ICP in patients with malignant hemispheric infarction.},

  abstract = {Cardiac output measurements are often helpful in the management of critically ill patients and high risk-patients. In this study an alternative technique for measurement of cardiac output by the transpulmonary indicator dilution technique (TPID) was evaluated in comparison to conventional thermodilution using a pulmonary artery catheter. With TPID, a thermistor-tipped catheter (the smallest available is 1.3 F) is placed in the aorta via a femoral artery introducer. Thus, TPID can also be used in very small children in whom placement of a pulmonary artery catheter may be difficult or even impossible. In principle, TPID is less invasive since the possible complications of the pulmonary catheters are avoided. We investigated the accuracy and reproducibility of transpulmonary thermodilution in patients over a broad range in age and body surface. Following approval by the ethics committee and written consent, the data were obtained from 21 patients without a circulatory shunt undergoing diagnostic heart catheterization. The patients were between 0.5 and 25.2 years old, their body surface between 0.35 and 1.89 m2. Measurements were performed in duplicate with bolus injections of ice-cold normal saline (0.15 ml/kg), randomly spread over the respiratory cycle. In total 48 thermodilution curves were measured simultaneously in the pulmonary artery and in the aorta. Thermodilution curves were monoexponentially extrapolated for elimination of recirculation and cardiac output was calculated with a standard Stewart Hamilton procedure. The amplitude of the typical arterial thermodilution curve shows a smaller and more delayed course than the pulmonary artery thermodilution curve. There was a very good correlation between the values found by pulmonary and TPID cardiac output measurements (R = 0.968). There was a slightly smaller cardiac output value measured by the TPID (Bias = -4.7 +/- 1.5% sem) The reproducibility of duplicate measurements with the two methods were nearly the same, the standard deviation of the difference was 10.9% for the pulmonary thermodilution method and 11.7% for TPID. DISCUSSION. TPID gives an alternative technique for measurement of cardiac output. We showed over a broad range in age and body surface a very good correlation with thermodilution measurements in the pulmonary artery. The slightly smaller values for TPID are explained by early recirculation, for clinical purposes the difference is negligible. However, the reproducibility of a method is clinically very important. Both methods showed in duplicate measurements basically the same reproducibility. The disadvantage of TPID in being more sensitive to baseline alteration is counterbalanced by less respiratory variability in comparison to the conventional thermodilution technique. However, by increasing the amount of injected indicator (i.e., 0.2 ml/kg approximately equal to 15 ml in an adult) it is possible to reduce the effect of baseline alteration. By using fiberoptic catheters it is even possible to use TPID as double-indicator dilution technique to measure intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV) and extravascular lung water (EVLW). We conclude that in many patients TPID might be an attractive, less invasive and reliable alternative to conventional cardiac output measurement by pulmonary artery catheter.},

However, the short-term repeatability of transcerebral double-indicator dilution measurements has not yet been investigated. The present study was designed to investigate the accuracy in terms of reliability for repeated transcerebral double-indicator dilution measurements to assess global cerebral blood flow during a definite carbon dioxide challenge in a clinical trial. The investigation was performed in 10 patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting. After induction of anaesthesia, repeated cerebral blood flow measurements using transcerebral double-indicator dilution were performed during target normocapnia, hypocapnia and hypercapnia. For transcerebral double-indicator dilution measurements, a bolus injection of ice-cold indocyanine green was administered into a central vein. The resulting thermal dye dilution curves were recorded simultaneously in the aorta and the jugular bulb using combined fibreoptic thermistor catheters. Cerebral blood flow was calculated from the mean transit times of the indicators through the brain. Additionally, transcranial Doppler sonography was simultaneously performed to measure transient changes in the cerebral blood flow velocity. Transcerebral double-indicator dilution measurements revealed a reasonable coefficient of repeatability with 9.1, 9.7 and 20.2 mL min-1 100 g-1 during normo-, hypo- and hypercapnic conditions, respectively. However, a total of 20% of the administered measurements had to be rejected for methodological reasons. Repeated measurements with the transcerebral double-indicator dilution method show a reasonable repeatability. With consideration to the limitations of the transcerebral double-indicator dilution technique, this new method proves to be a reliable monitoring tool to measure global cerebral blood flow at the bedside.},

However, there has been considerable skepticism as to whether H-PDI would be quantifiable, because it depends on the destruction of microbubbles and has more complex signal processing than gray scale imaging. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the concentration of microbubbles and the resulting H-PDI signals even under conditions where bubble destruction is most likely. Furthermore, we evaluated whether microbubbles of Levovist freely pass the microcirculation, which is a prerequisite for the assessment of myocardial blood flow. A strong positive correlation was found between the H-PDI signals and the amount of microbubbles up to the onset of acoustic shadowing (r = 0. 968, P<0.001). Time-intensity curves for H-PDI of air-filled microbubbles were compared with time-concentration curves of indocyanine green (ICG) in both a flow phantom and a working heart setup. The mean transit times (MTTs) through the myocardium of both agents were compared after a bolus injection into the left coronary artery. A close correlation was observed between 1/MTT and flow in both setups (r>0.98, P<0.0001). However, at high flow rates, the MTTs of the microbubbles were slightly, albeit not significantly, faster than those of indocyanine green. We conclude that microbubbles fulfill the prerequisites of free flowing tracers through the myocardium. Furthermore, H-PDI technology allows a reliable assessment of time-concentration curves of air-filled microbubbles up to the onset of acoustic shadowing.},

  abstract = {Using indocyanine green (ICG), blood volume can be determined within minutes according to the mass conservation principle by back-extrapolation of the concentration/time curve to the time of injection (BVTinj) or by the transit time approach (BVMTT) as the product of cardiac output and mean transit time (MTT) of ICG through the circulation. To see which factor accounts for the difference between the two methods we measured cardiac output and MTT independently and compared the volumes with those obtained by dilution of Evans blue (BVEB). Prospective animal study. University department of experimental anaesthesiology. Six anaesthetised, spontaneously breathing dogs with chronically implanted ultrasound flow probes around the pulmonary artery. BVMTT and BVTinj agreed closely (48 +/- 2 ml.kg-1 and 49 +/- 2 ml.kg-1), but underestimated blood volume by about 40% compared with BVEB (75 +/- 1 ml.kg-1). Transit times measured were 33 +/- 1 s and should be about 50 s as calculated from the quotient of BVEB and cardiac output. Both methods underestimate blood volume by about the same extent compared with BVEB, probably because slowly perfused compartments are not detected during the short measurement period of 4 min. In the case of the transit time approach, rather short transit times result and in the case of the mass conservation principle, back-extra-polation yields rather high plasma concentrations of ICG at the time of injection. Accordingly, the two methods seem to be equivalent for measuring blood volume rapidly, although the absolute volume is underestimated by about 40%.},

  abstract = {The biomedical approach to medical knowledge is widely accepted around the world. This article considers whether the incorporated aspects of physician-patient interaction have become similarly common across the globe by comparing the gestures that physicians use in their interactions with patients. Up to this point, there has been little research on physicians' use of gestures in health-care settings. We explore how-in four university hospitals in Turkey, the People's Republic of China, The Netherlands and Germany-physicians use gesture in their discussions with simulated patients about the condition of heart failure. Our analysis confirms the importance of gestures for organising both the personal interaction and the knowledge transfer between physician and patient. From the perspective of global comparison, it is notable that physicians in all four hospitals used similar gestures. This demonstrates the globality of biomedical knowledge in an embodied mode. Physicians used gestures for a range of purposes, including to convey the idea of an 'anatomical map' and for constructing visual models of (patho-)physiological processes. Since biomedical language is rife with metaphor, it was not surprising that we also identified an accompanying metaphorical gesture which has a similar form in the various locations that were part of the study.},

  abstract = {Thermodilution measurements of cardiac output (CO) by means of Swan-Ganz catheters, in a strict sense, represent pulmonary arterial blood flow (PBF). In principle, this is also true in the presence of intracardiac left-to-right shunts due to atrial or ventricular septal defects. However, early recirculation of indicator may give rise to serious methodological problems in these cases. We sought to determine the influence of intracardiac left-to-right shunts on different devices for thermodilution measurements of CO using an extra-corporeal flow model. METHODS. Blood flow was regulated by means of a centrifugal pump that at the same time enabled complete mixing of the indicator after injection (Fig. 1). Pulmonary and systemic parts of the circulation were simulated using two membrane oxygenators and a systemic-venous reservoir to delay systemic recirculation of indicator. Control measurements of PBF (Qp) and systemic (Qs) blood flow were performed by calibrated electromagnetic flow-meters (EMF). Blood temperature was kept constant using a heat exchanger without altering the indicator mass balance in the pulmonary circulation. Left-to-right shunt was varied at different systemic flow levels applying a Qp:Qs ratio ranging from 1:1 to 2.5:1. Thermodilution measurements of PBF were performed using two different thermodilution catheters that were connected to commercially available CO computers. Additionally, thermodilution curves were recorded on a microcomputer and analysed with custom-made software that enabled iterative regression analyses of the initial decay to determine that part of the downslope that best fits a mono-exponentially declining function. Extrapolation of the thermodilution curve was then based on the respective curve segment in order to eliminate indicator recirculation due to shunt flow. RESULTS. At moderate left-to-right shunts (Qp:Qs < 2:1) all thermodilution measurements showed close agreement with control measurements. At higher shunt flows (Qp:Qs > or = 2:1), however, conventional extrapolation procedures of CO computers considerably underestimated PBF (Fig. 2). This was particularly true when a slow-response thermistor catheter was used (Fig. 3). The reason for this underestimation of Qp was an overestimation of the area under curve because of inadequate mathematical elimination of indicator recirculation by standard truncation methods (Fig. 4). However, curve-alert messages of the commercially implemented software did not occur. A high level of agreement could be consistently obtained using a fast-response thermistor together with individual definition of extrapolation limits according to logarithmic regression analyses. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION. Under varying levels of left-to-right shunt, both the response time of thermodilution catheters and the algorithms for calculation of flow considerably influenced the validity of thermodilution measurements of PBF in an extracorporeal flow model. The use of computer-based regression analyses to define the optimal segment for monoexponential extrapolation could effectively eliminate indicator recirculation from the initial portion of the declining thermodilution curve and showed the closest agreement with EMF measurements of Qp. The quality of thermodilution curves with respect to recirculation peaks in the flow model was slightly better than in clinical routine. Nevertheless, the clinical applicability of the modified extrapolation algorithm could be illustrated during pulmonary thermodilution measurements in an exemplary patient with a ventricular septal defect (Fig. 5). PBF at extremely high shunt ratios, however, cannot be assessed by monoexponential extrapolation in principle (Fig. 6). Insufficient elimination of indicator recirculation resulted in flow values that closely resembled systemic rather than PBF. This finding is in accordance with a mathematical analysis of the underlying Steward-Hamilton equation if an infinite number of recirculations would be},

  abstract = {Indocyanine green (ICG) elimination tests have been repeatedly suggested as an early predictor of graft function in patients with liver transplantation. Conventionally, ICG clearance (ClICG) is measured by a series of blood samples with subsequent laboratory analysis. More recently bedside techniques have become available to measure ICG concentrations in vivo and in addition to ClICG, the plasma disappearance rate of ICG (PDRICG) is increasingly being used. The aim of this study was to assess and to compare the normal time courses of ClICG and PDRICG in liver transplant recipients. ClICG and PDRICG were measured perioperatively and at various times up to 24 h after liver transplantation. The bedside transpulmonary indicator dilution technique with an arterial fiberoptic-thermistor catheter was used to assess the ICG concentration time curve together with total circulating blood volume (Vd circ). Similar patterns of the time courses of ClICG and PDRICG with a fast recovery of ICG elimination in the early reperfusion period were observed. Compared to healthy subjects, ClICG was supranormal and PDRICG was slightly subnormal. In this study, Vd circ was increased at baseline and remained increased during surgery. PDRICG and ClICG are well suited to monitor onset and maintenance of graft function in patients undergoing liver transplantation. The PDRICG values measured tend to be relatively lower than ClICG because of an increased blood volume in these patients. By knowing these differences it is justified to monitor liver function in a very simple manner with PDRICG.},

  abstract = {Total cavo-pulmonary anastomosis (TCPA) is used for the functional correction of an increasing spectrum of congenital heart diseases. The passive pulmonary perfusion after surgical exclusion of the right ventricle has significant implications for the postoperative hemodynamic management of these patients. Because conventional pulmonary artery thermodilution catheters present methodologic problems in patients after TCPA, important cardiovascular variables such as cardiac index (CI) and pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance indices (PVRI, SVRI) usually cannot be assessed directly. In a preliminary series of six patients undergoing TCPA (age 6-22 years), the applicability of a transpulmonary double indicator dilution technique for postoperative determinations of CI, PVRI, SVRI, and extravascular lung water (EVLW) was investigated. After central venous injection of ice-cold indocyanine green (5 mg), thermal and dye dilution curves were recorded in the abdominal aorta using a combined 4F fiberoptic thermistor catheter. Qualitative assessment of the tracer curves did not show major differences in measurements in patients with pulsatile perfusion of the lungs. CI, SVRI, and EVLW could be determined by use of standard algorithms. Pulmonary perfusion pressure for the calculation of PVRI was based on the gradient between central venous and left atrial pressure. The quality of indicator dilution curves allowed determination of flow-related variables in 33 of a total of 34 sets of measurements. No catheter-related problems occurred during or after the period of investigation. Postoperative EVLW was within the range that is commonly accepted as normal for adults. Mean PVRI initially decreased during the postoperative course but showed a significant increase after extubation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The best clinical measure of preload is the end-diastolic volume of the heart, which can be assessed by ventriculography, echocardiography or by indicator dilution techniques. Afterload is basically the wall tension during the ejection phase. For clinical purposes afterload can be reasonably monitored by arterial blood pressure. The most difficult parameter to assess under clinical conditions is contractility, since exact measurement of contractility requires instantaneous measurements of left-ventricular pressure-volume loops and an artificial afterload or preload challenge. However, most recent theoretical analysis of ventricular-arterial coupling by various models revealed that the ejection fraction seems to be an appropriate parameter to evaluate, whether the prevailing contractility matches preload and afterload conditions. An ejection fraction of approximately 60% under almost any clinical circumstances is associated with an optimal performance of the heart in terms of myocardial oxygen utilisation.},

Besides, inulin chicory taproots also accumulate sesquiterpene lactones (STLs). These are bitter tasting compounds, which need to be removed during inulin extraction, resulting in additional costs. In this work, we describe chicory lines where STL accumulation is almost completely eliminated. Genome editing using the CRISPR/Cas9 system was used to inactivate four genes that encode the enzyme that performs the first dedicated step in STL synthesis, germacrene A synthase (CiGAS). Chicory lines were obtained that carried null mutations in all four CiGAS genes. Lines lacking functional CiGAS alleles showed a normal phenotype upon greenhouse cultivation and show nearly complete elimination of the STL synthesis in the roots. It was shown that the reduction in STLs could be attributed to mutations in genetically linked copies of the CiGAS-short gene and not the CiGAS-long gene, which is relevant for breeding the trait into other cultivars. The inactivation of the STL biosynthesis pathway led to increase in phenolic compounds as well as accumulation of squalene in the chicory taproot, presumably due to increased availability of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FFP). These results demonstrate that STLs are not essential for chicory growth and that the inhibition of the STL biosynthesis pathway reduced the STL levels chicory which will facilitate inulin extraction.},

These small molecules have shown several health benefits for various diseases, including brain disorders. However, it is unknown whether these compounds can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and which could be the effects on brain microvascular endothelial cells. We show that six sesquiterpene lactones evaluated in an in vitro model of the BBB have different capacities to be transported through the barrier. Costunolide presented more than 20 % of transport while lactucin, 11β-13-dihydrolactucin, 11β-13-dihydrolactucopicrin, and parthenolide presented between 10 % and 20 %, whilst almost no transport was detected for lactucopicrin. Furthermore, costunolide and parthenolide reduced P-gp ABC transporter expression alongside an increase in caveolin-1, the main protein of caveolae. Remarkably, these two compounds improved barrier tightness by increasing the expression of both tight and adherens junctions. These findings open a new avenue to explore costunolide and parthenolide as promising compounds for brain therapies.},

The cultivation of BY-2 cells in disposable bioreactors is a useful alternative to conventional stainless steel stirred-tank reactors, and orbitally-shaken bioreactors could provide further advantages such as simple bag geometry, scalability and predictable process settings. We carried out a scale-up study, using a 200-L orbitally-shaken bioreactor holding disposable bags, and BY-2 cells producing the human monoclonal antibody M12. We found that cell growth and recombinant protein accumulation were comparable to standard shake flask cultivation, despite a 200-fold difference in cultivation volume. Final cell fresh weights of 300-387 g/L and M12 yields of ∼20 mg/L were achieved with both cultivation methods. Furthermore, we established an efficient downstream process for the recovery of M12 from the culture broth. The viscous spent medium prevented clarification using filtration devices, but we used expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography with SP Sepharose as an alternative for the efficient capture of the M12 antibody. EBA was introduced as an initial purification step prior to protein A affinity chromatography, resulting in an overall M12 recovery of 75-85% and a purity of >95%. Our results demonstrate the suitability of orbitally-shaken bioreactors for the scaled-up cultivation of plant cell suspension cultures and provide a strategy for the efficient purification of antibodies from the BY-2 culture medium.},

Experiments with model proteins showed that the T2A sequence of the Thosea asigna virus mediated efficient production of individual proteins from a single transcript in S. cerevisiae. Subsequently, three β-carotene biosynthesis genes from the carotenoid-producing ascomycete Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (crtI, crtE and crtYB) were expressed in S. cerevisiae from a single polycistronic construct. In this construct, the individual crt proteins were separated by T2A sequences. Production of the individual proteins from the polycistronic construct was confirmed by Western blot analysis and by measuring the production of β-carotene. To enable β-ionone production, a carotenoid-cleavage dioxygenase from raspberry (RiCCD1) was co-expressed in the β-carotene producing strain. In glucose-grown cultures with a second phase of dodecane, β-ionone and geranylacetone accumulated in the organic phase. Thus, by introducing a polycistronic construct encoding a fungal carotenoid pathway and an expression cassette encoding a plant dioxygenase, a novel microbial production system has been established for a fruit flavour compound.},

It is an oxidized sesquiterpene, which has been postulated to be derived from valencene. Both valencene and nootkatone are used for flavouring citrus beverages and are considered among the most valuable terpenes used at commercial scale. Functional evaluation of putative terpene synthase genes sourced by large-scale EST sequencing from Nootka cypress wood revealed a valencene synthase gene (CnVS). CnVS expression in different tissues from the tree correlates well with nootkatone content, suggesting that CnVS represents the first dedicated gene in the nootkatone biosynthetic pathway in C. nootkatensis The gene belongs to the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily of terpenes synthases and its protein sequence has low similarity to known citrus valencene synthases. In vitro, CnVS displays high robustness under different pH and temperature regimes, potentially beneficial properties for application in different host and physiological conditions. Biotechnological production of sesquiterpenes has been shown to be feasible, but productivity of microbial strains expressing valencene synthase from Citrus is low, indicating that optimization of valencene synthase activity is needed. Indeed, expression of CnVS in Saccharomyces cerevisiae indicated potential for higher yields. In an optimized Rhodobacter sphaeroides strain, expression of CnVS increased valencene yields 14-fold to 352 mg/L, bringing production to levels with industrial potential.},

  abstract = {For several sesquiterpene lactones (STLs) found in Asteraceae plants, very interesting biomedical activities have been demonstrated. Chicory roots accumulate the guaianolide STLs 8-deoxylactucin, lactucin, and lactucopicrin predominantly in oxalated forms in the latex. In this work, a supercritical fluid extract fraction of chicory STLs containing 8-deoxylactucin and 11β,13-dihydro-8-deoxylactucin was shown to have anti-inflammatory activity in an inflamed intestinal mucosa model. To increase the accumulation of these two compounds in chicory taproots, the lactucin synthase that takes 8-deoxylactucin as the substrate for the regiospecific hydroxylation to generate lactucin needs to be inactivated. Three candidate cytochrome P450 enzymes of the CYP71 clan were identified in chicory. Their targeted inactivation using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach identified CYP71DD33 to have lactucin synthase activity. The analysis of the terpene profile of the taproots of plants with edits in },

  abstract = {Most secreted proteins in eukaryotes are modified on the amino acid consensus sequence NxS/T by an N-glycan through the process of N-glycosylation. The N-glycans on glycoproteins are processed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to different mannose-type N-glycans or, when the protein passes through the Golgi apparatus, to different complex glycan forms. Here we describe the capturing of N-glycopeptides from a trypsin digest of total protein extracts of Arabidopsis plants and release of these captured peptides following Peptide N-glycosidase (PNGase) treatment for analysis of N-glycan site-occupancy. The mixture of peptides released as a consequence of the PNGase treatment was analyzed by two dimensional nano-LC-MS. As the PNGase treatment of glycopeptides results in the deamidation of the asparagine (N) in the NxS/T site of the released peptide, this asparagine (N) to aspartic acid (D) conversion is used as a glycosylation 'signature'. The efficiency of PNGase F and PNGase A in peptide release is discussed. The identification of proteins with a single glycopeptide was limited by the used search algorithm but could be improved using a reference database including deamidated peptide sequences. Additional stringency settings were used for filtering results to minimize false discovery. This resulted in identification of 330 glycopeptides on 173 glycoproteins from Arabidopsis, of which 28 putative glycoproteins, that were previously not annotated as secreted protein in The Arabidopsis Information Resource database (TAIR). Furthermore, the identified glycosylation site occupancy helped to determine the correct topology for membrane proteins. A quantitative comparison of peptide signal was made between wild type and complex-glycan-less (cgl) mutant Arabidopsis from three replicate leaf samples using a label-free MS peak comparison. As an example, the identified membrane protein SKU5 (AT4G12420) showed differential glycopeptide intensity ratios between WT and cgl indicating heterogeneous glycan modification on single protein. Proteins that enter the secretory pathway are mostly modified by N-glycans. The function of N-glycosylation has been well studied in mammals. However, in plants the function of N-glycosylation is still unclear, because glycosylation mutants in plants often do not have a clear phenotype. Here we analyzed which proteins are modified by N-glycans in plants by developing a glycopeptide enrichment method for plant proteins. Subsequently, label free comparative proteomics was employed using protein fractions from wild type and from a mutant which is blocked in modification of the N-glycan into complex glycans. The results provide new information on N-glycosylation sites on numerous secreted proteins. Results allow for specific mapping of multiple glycosylation site occupancy on proteins, which provides information on which glycosylation sites are protected or non-used from downstream processing and thus presumably are buried into the protein structure. Glycoproteomics can therefore contribute to protein structure analysis. Indeed, mapping the glycosylation sites on membrane proteins gives information on the topology of protein folds over the membrane. We thus were able to correct the topology prediction of three membrane proteins. Besides, these studies also identified limitations in the software that is used to identify single modified peptide per protein.

Wild type glycosylation of plants can be exploited to produce vaccines that antigen-presenting cells effectively take up, degrade and present to cells of the adaptive immune system. Alternatively, glycoengineered plants can be used to produce humanized antigens. Glycoengineering also allows the construction of plants that are able to produce vaccines with custom-made N-glycan structures aiding the construction of vaccines that can be delivered to antigen-presenting cells in a target-oriented approach. The knowledge of innate immune receptors and their role in antigen uptake and presentation is rapidly increasing.

Apples with significantly decreased levels of Mal d 1 would allow most patients in these areas to eat apples without allergic reactions. The aim of this study was to inhibit the expression of Mal d 1 in apple plants by RNA interference. In vitro -grown apple plantlets were transformed with a construct coding for an intron-spliced hairpin RNA containing a Mal d 1-specific inverted repeat sequence separated by a Mal d 1-specific intron sequence. The presence of the construct in transformants was checked by PCR. Expression of Mal d 1 in leaves was monitored by prick-to-prick skin testing in 3 patients allergic to apples and by immunoblotting with a Mal d 1-reactive mAb and with IgE antibodies against Mal d 1. After transformation, plantlets were selected on the basis of having a normal phenotype and growth rate. With PCR, in 6 of 9 selected plantlets, the presence of the gene-silencing construct was demonstrated. By skin prick test it was shown that a wild-type plantlet had significantly ( P < .05) higher allergenicity than 5 of the transformants. Reduction of expression of Mal d 1 was confirmed by immunoblotting. In wild-type and unsuccessful transformants, a strong band was detected with Mal d 1-reactive mAb 5H8 at the expected apparent M r of 17 kDa. This band was virtually absent in the transformants that carried the gene-silencing construct. With human IgE antibodies, the same observations were made. Mal d 1 expression was successfully reduced by RNA interference. This translated into significantly reduced in vivo allergenicity. These observations support the feasibility of the production by gene silencing of apples hypoallergenic for Mal d 1.},

These analyses revealed that most of the complex-type N-glycans in the plants expressing GnT-III were bisected and carried at least two terminal N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues in contrast to wild-type plants, where a considerable proportion of N-glycans did not contain GlcNAc residues at the nonreducing end. Moreover, we have shown that the majority of N-glycans of an antibody produced in a plant expressing GnT-III is also bisected.

  abstract = {Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an important staple food. However, wheat gluten proteins cause celiac disease (CD) in 0.5 to 1% of the general population. Among these proteins, the alpha-gliadins contain several peptides that are associated to the disease. We obtained 230 distinct alpha-gliadin gene sequences from severaldiploid wheat species representing the ancestral A, B, and D genomes of the hexaploid bread wheat. The large majority of these sequences (87%) contained an internal stop codon. All alpha-gliadin sequences could be distinguished according to the genome of origin on the basis of sequence similarity, of the average length of the polyglutamine repeats, and of the differences in the presence of four peptides that have been identified as T cell stimulatory epitopes in CD patients through binding to HLA-DQ2/8. By sequence similarity, alpha-gliadins from the public database of hexaploid T. aestivum could be assigned directly to chromosome 6A, 6B, or 6D. T. monococcum (A genome) sequences, as well as those from chromosome 6A of bread wheat, almost invariably contained epitope glia-alpha9 and glia-alpha20, but never the intact epitopes glia-alpha and glia-alpha2. A number of sequences from T. speltoides, as well as a number of sequences fromchromosome 6B of bread wheat, did not contain any of the four T cell epitopes screened for. The sequences from T. tauschii (D genome), as well as those from chromosome 6D of bread wheat, were found to contain all of these T cell epitopes in variable combinations per gene. The differences in epitope composition resulted mainly from point mutations. These substitutions appeared to be genome specific. Our analysis shows that alpha-gliadin sequences from the three genomes of bread wheat form distinct groups. The four known T cell stimulatory epitopes are distributed non-randomly across the sequences, indicating that the three genomes contribute differently to epitope content. A systematic analysis of all known epitopes in gliadins and glutenins will lead to better understanding of the differences in toxicity among wheat varieties. On the basis of such insight, breeding strategies can be designed to generate less toxic varieties of wheat which may be tolerated by at least part of the CD patient population.},

Due to its characteristic scent, it is frequently used in dairy products, tea drinks and fine fragrances. The demand for natural indole by the flavor and fragrance industry is high, yet, its abundance in essential oils isolated from plants such as jasmine and narcissus is low. Thus, there is a strong demand for a sustainable method to produce food-grade indole. Here, we established the biotechnological production of indole upon L-tryptophan supplementation in the bacterial host Corynebacterium glutamicum. Heterologous expression of the tryptophanase gene from E. coli enabled the conversion of supplemented L-tryptophan to indole. Engineering of the substrate import by co-expression of the native aromatic amino acid permease gene aroP increased whole-cell biotransformation of L-tryptophan to indole by two-fold. Indole production to 0.2 g L The bioconversion production process established in this study provides an attractive route for sustainable indole production from tryptophan in C. glutamicum. Industrially relevant indole titers were achieved within 24 h and indole was concentrated in the organic layer as a pure product after the fermentation.},

In CD patients gluten-derived peptides are presented to the immune system, which leads to a CD4+ T-cell mediated immune response and inflammation of the small intestine. However, not all gluten proteins contain T-cell stimulatory epitopes. Gluten proteins are encoded by multigene loci present on chromosomes 1 and 6 of the three different genomes of hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) (AABBDD). The effects of deleting individual gluten loci on both the level of T-cell stimulatory epitopes in the gluten proteome and the technological properties of the flour were analyzed using a set of deletion lines of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. The reduction of T-cell stimulatory epitopes was analyzed using monoclonal antibodies that recognize T-cell epitopes present in gluten proteins. The deletion lines were technologically tested with respect to dough mixing properties and dough rheology. The results show that removing the alpha-gliadin locus from the short arm of chromosome 6 of the D-genome (6DS) resulted in a significant decrease in the presence of T-cell stimulatory epitopes but also in a significant loss of technological properties. However, removing the omega-gliadin, gamma-gliadin, and LMW-GS loci from the short arm of chromosome 1 of the D-genome (1DS) removed T-cell stimulatory epitopes from the proteome while maintaining technological properties.

The At ALG3 protein can complement a Deltaalg3 yeast mutant and is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum in yeast and in plants. A homozygous T-DNA insertion mutant, alg3-2, was identified in Arabidopsis with residual levels of wild-type ALG3, derived from incidental splicing of the 11th intron carrying the T-DNAs. N-glycan analysis of alg3-2 and alg3-2 in the complex-glycan-less mutant background, which lacks N-acetylglucosaminyl-transferase I activity, reveals that when ALG3 activity is strongly reduced, almost all N-glycans transferred to proteins are aberrant, indicating that the Arabidopsis oligosaccharide transferase complex is remarkably substrate tolerant. In alg3-2 plants, the aberrant glycans on glycoproteins are recognized by endogenous mannosidase I and N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and efficiently processed into complex-type glycans. Although no high-mannose-type glycoproteins are detected in alg3-2 plants, these plants do not show a growth phenotype under normal growth conditions. However, the glycosylation abnormalities result in activation of marker genes diagnostic of the unfolded protein response.},

Plant-based production systems for terpenoids critically depend on the availability of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Currently, these systems show insufficient yields, due to the competition for FPP of newly introduced pathways with endogenous ones. In this study, for the first time an RNAi strategy aiming at silencing of endogenous pathways for increased (+)-valencene production was employed. Firstly, a transient production system for (+)-valencene in Nicotiana benthamiana was set up using agroinfiltration. Secondly, silencing of the endogenous 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS) and squalene synthase (SQS) that compete for the FPP pool was deployed. This resulted in a N. benthamiana plant that produces (+)-valencene as a prevalent volatile with a 2.8-fold increased yield. Finally, the size of the FPP pool was increased by overexpression of enzymes that are rate-limiting in FPP biosynthesis. Combined with silencing of EAS and SQS, no further increase of (+)-valencene production was observed, but emission of farnesol. Formation of farnesol, which is a breakdown product of FPP, indicates that overproducing sesquiterpenes is no longer limited by FPP availability in the cytosol. This study shows that metabolic engineering of plants can effectively be used for increased production of desired products in plants.},

Plant production of flavonoids is limited by the low productivity and the complexity of the recovered flavonoids. Thus to overcome these limitations, metabolic engineering of specific pathway in microbial systems have been envisaged to produce high quantity of a single molecules. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was engineered to produce the key intermediate flavonoid, naringenin, solely from glucose. For this, specific naringenin biosynthesis genes from Arabidopsis thaliana were selected by comparative expression profiling and introduced in S. cerevisiae. The sole expression of these A. thaliana genes yielded low extracellular naringenin concentrations (<5.5 μM). To optimize naringenin titers, a yeast chassis strain was developed. Synthesis of aromatic amino acids was deregulated by alleviating feedback inhibition of 3-deoxy-d-arabinose-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (Aro3, Aro4) and byproduct formation was reduced by eliminating phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (Aro10, Pdc5, Pdc6). Together with an increased copy number of the chalcone synthase gene and expression of a heterologous tyrosine ammonia lyase, these modifications resulted in a 40-fold increase of extracellular naringenin titers (to approximately 200 μM) in glucose-grown shake-flask cultures. In aerated, pH controlled batch reactors, extracellular naringenin concentrations of over 400 μM were reached. The results reported in this study demonstrate that S. cerevisiae is capable of de novo production of naringenin by coexpressing the naringenin production genes from A. thaliana and optimization of the flux towards the naringenin pathway. The engineered yeast naringenin production host provides a metabolic chassis for production of a wide range of flavonoids and exploration of their biological functions.},

We evaluated antibody yield, quality and N-glycosylation. All six antibodies had comparable levels of expression between 3.5 and 9% of total soluble protein content and were shown to have neutralizing activity in a cell-based assay. However, IgA1κ-based Adalimumab and Ustekinumab were poorly secreted compared to their IgG counterparts. Infliximab was poorly secreted regardless of isotype backbone. This corresponded with the observation that both IgA1κ- and IgG1κ-based Infliximab were enriched in oligomannose-type N-glycan structures. For IgG1κ-based Ustekinumab and Adalimumab, the major N-glycan type was the typical plant complex N-glycan, biantennary with terminal N-acetylglucosamine, β1,2-xylose and core α1,3-fucose. In contrast, the major N-glycan on the IgA-based antibodies was xylosylated, but lacked core α1,3-fucose and one terminal N-acetylglucosamine. This type of N-glycan occurs usually in marginal percentages in plants and was never shown to be the main fraction of a plant-produced recombinant protein.

To address these challenges, we used a design of experiments approach to develop an optimized induction protocol for the cultivation of tobacco hairy roots secreting the full-size monoclonal antibody M12. The antibody yield was enhanced 30-fold by the addition of 14 g/L KNO3 , 19 mg/L 1-naphthaleneacetic acid and 1.5 g/L of the stabilizing agent polyvinylpyrrolidone. Analysis of hairy root cross sections revealed that the optimized medium induced lateral root formation and morphological changes in the inner cortex and pericycle cells, indicating that the improved productivity was at least partially based on the enhanced efficiency of antibody secretion. We found that 57% of the antibody was secreted, yielding 5.9 mg of product per liter of induction medium. Both the secreted and intracellular forms of the antibody could be isolated by protein A affinity chromatography and their functionality was confirmed using vitronectin-binding assays. Glycan analysis revealed three major plant complex-type glycans on both forms of the antibody, although the secreted form was more homogeneous due to the predominance of a specific glycoform. Tobacco hairy root cultures therefore offer a practical solution for the production of homogeneous pharmaceutical antibodies in containment.},

  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus causing a respiratory disease that emerged in 2019, leading to a public health emergency situation which continues to date. The treatment options are still very limited and vaccines available are less effective against new variants. SARS-CoV-2 enzymes, namely main protease (Mpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro), play a pivotal role in the viral life cycle, making them a putative drug target. Here, we described for the first time the potential inhibitory activity of chicory extract against both proteases. Besides, we have identified that the four most abundant sesquiterpene lactones in chicory inhibited these proteases, showing an effective binding in the active sites of Mpro and PLpro. This paper provides new insight for further drug development or food-based strategies for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 by targeting viral proteases.},

One reason for this is their ability to carry out posttranslational protein modifications in a similar if not identical way as mammalian cells. The capability of plants to carry out human-like complex glycosylation is well known. Moreover, the targeted manipulation of the plant N-glycosylation pathway allows the production of proteins carrying largely homogeneous, human-type oligosaccharides. These outstanding results have placed plants in a favourable position compared to other eukaryotic expression systems. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the N-glycosylation of plant-produced recombinant proteins, the possible impact of plant-specific N-glycans on the human immune system, and recent advances in engineering the plant N-glycosylation pathway towards the synthesis of (complex) human-type glycan structures, highlighting challenges and achievements in the application of these powerful technologies.},

Previously, we described an Arabidopsis alg3-2 glycosylation mutant in which aberrant Man(5)GlcNAc(2) mannose type N-glycans are transferred to proteins. Here we show that the alg3-2 mutation reduces the N-glycan heterogeneity on ER resident glycoproteins in seeds. We compared the properties of a scFv-Fc, with a KDEL ER retention tag (MBP10) that was expressed in seeds of wild type and alg3-2 plants. N-glycans on these antibodies from mutant seeds were predominantly of the intermediate Man(5)GlcNAc(2) compared to Man(8)GlcNAc(2) and Man(7)GlcNAc(2) isoforms on MBP10 from wild-type seeds. The presence of aberrant N-glycans on MBP10 did not seem to affect MBP10 dimerisation nor binding of MBP10 to its antigen. In alg3-2 the fraction of underglycosylated MBP10 protein forms was higher than in wild type. Interestingly, the expression of MBP10 resulted also in underglycosylation of other, endogenous glycoproteins.},

Specific gluten peptides can be presented by antigen presenting cells to gluten-sensitive T-cell lymphocytes leading to CD. During the last decades, a significant increase has been observed in the prevalence of CD. This may partly be attributed to an increase in awareness and to improved diagnostic techniques, but increased wheat and gluten consumption is also considered a major cause. To analyze whether wheat breeding contributed to the increase of the prevalence of CD, we have compared the genetic diversity of gluten proteins for the presence of two CD epitopes (Glia-α9 and Glia-α20) in 36 modern European wheat varieties and in 50 landraces representing the wheat varieties grown up to around a century ago. Glia-α9 is a major (immunodominant) epitope that is recognized by the majority of CD patients. The minor Glia-α20 was included as a technical reference. Overall, the presence of the Glia-α9 epitope was higher in the modern varieties, whereas the presence of the Glia-α20 epitope was lower, as compared to the landraces. This suggests that modern wheat breeding practices may have led to an increased exposure to CD epitopes. On the other hand, some modern varieties and landraces have been identified that have relatively low contents of both epitopes. Such selected lines may serve as a start to breed wheat for the introduction of 'low CD toxic' as a new breeding trait. Large-scale culture and consumption of such varieties would considerably aid in decreasing the prevalence of CD.},

Here we show that these differences are associated with differences at its N-terminus: the natural short variant of human GalT results in hybrid type N-glycans, whereas the long form generates bi-antennary complex type N-glycans. Furthermore, expression of non-mammalian, chicken and zebrafish GalT homologues with N-termini resembling the short human GalT N-terminus also induce hybrid type N-glycans. Providing both non-mammalian GalTs with a 13 amino acid N-terminal extension that distinguishes the two naturally occurring forms of human GalT, acted to increase the levels of bi-antennary galactosylated N-glycans when expressed in tobacco leaves. Replacement of the cytosolic tail and transmembrane domain of chicken and zebrafish GalTs with the corresponding region of rat α2,6-sialyltransferase yielded a gene whose expression enhanced the level of bi-antennary galactosylation even further.},

LEW3 is localized to the ER membrane and expressed throughout the plant. Mutation of LEW3 caused low-level accumulation of Man(3)GlcNAc(2) and Man(4)GlcNAc(2) glycans, structures that are seldom detected in wild-type plants. In addition, the lew3 mutant has low levels of normal high-mannose-type glycans, but increased levels of complex-type glycans. The lew3 mutant showed abnormal developmental phenotypes, reduced fertility, impaired cellulose synthesis, abnormal primary cell walls, and xylem collapse due to disturbance of the secondary cell walls. lew3 mutants were more sensitive to osmotic stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Protein N-glycosylation was reduced and the unfolded protein response was more activated by osmotic stress and ABA treatment in the lew3 mutant than in the wild-type. These results demonstrate that protein N-glycosylation plays crucial roles in plant development and the response to abiotic stresses.},

Gluten proteins present in public databases were analyzed for the presence of T-cell-stimulatory sequences. In addition, wheat accessions from diploid (AA, SS/BB, and DD genomes), tetraploid (AABB), and hexaploid (AABBDD) Triticum species were tested for the presence of T-cell-stimulatory epitopes in gliadins and glutenins by both T-cell and monoclonal antibody-based assays. The database analysis readily identified gluten proteins that lack 1 or more of the known T-cell-stimulatory sequences. Moreover, both the T-cell- and antibody-based assays showed that a large variation exists in the amount of T-cell-stimulatory peptides present in the wheat accessions. Sufficient genetic variation is present to endeavor the selection of wheat accessions that contain low amounts of T-cell-stimulatory sequences. Such materials may be used to select and breed wheat varieties suitable for consumption by CD patients, contributing to a well-balanced diet and an increase in their quality of life. Such varieties also may be useful for disease prevention in individuals at risk.},

To determine whether oxidative stress could play a role in the chemoprevention of colorectal cancer by n-3 PUFAs, feces and caecal content were examined using the TBA assay. The results showed that lipid peroxidation does occur in the gastrointestinal tract. As several lipid peroxidation products of n-3 PUFAs can induce phase II detoxifying enzymes by an EpRE-mediated pathway, the in vivo results suggest that this route may contribute to n-3 PUFA-mediated chemoprevention.

In this study, two Arabidopsis UDP-galactose transporter cDNAs (UDP-GalT1 and UDP-GalT2) are isolated by expression cloning using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-Lec8) deficient in UDP-galactose transport. The isolated genes show only 21% identity to each other and very limited sequence identity with human and yeast UDP-galactose transporters and other NSTs. Despite this low overall identity, the two proteins clearly belong to the same gene family. Besides complementing Lec8 cells, the two NSTs are shown to transport exclusively UDP-galactose by an in vitro NST assay. The most homologous proteins with known function are plant transporters that locate in the inner chloroplast membrane and transport triose-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate, and xylulose 5-phosphate. Also, the latter proteins are members of the same family, which therefore has been named the NST/triose-phosphate transporter family.},

In contrast to AtGnTI-YFP, only low levels of HuGnTI-YFP protein was detected in transgenic plants. In protoplast co-transfection experiments all GnTI-YFP fusion proteins co-localized with a Golgi marker protein, but only limited co-localization of AtGnTI and HuGnTI in the same plant protoplast. The partial alternative targeting of HuGnTI in plant protoplasts was alleviated by exchanging the membrane-anchor domain with that of AtGnTI, but in stably transformed cgl1-1 plants this chimeric GnTI still did not lead to full complementation of the cgl1-1 phenotype. Combined, the results indicate that activity of HuGnTI in plants is limited by a combination of reduced protein stability, alternative protein targeting and possibly to some extend to lower enzymatic performance of the catalytic domain in the plant biochemical environment.},

A mAb purified from leaves of plants expressing xylGalT displayed an N-glycan profile that featured high levels of galactose, undetectable xylose, and a trace of fucose. Hence, a transgenic plant expressing the hybrid GalT might yield more effective and safer monoclonals for therapeutic purposes than WT plants and even transgenic plants expressing the unchanged GalT.},

  abstract = {Monoterpene cyclases are the key enzymes in the monoterpene biosynthetic pathway, as they catalyze the cyclization of the ubiquitous geranyl diphosphate (GDP) to the specific monoterpene skeletons. From Citrus limon, four monoterpene synthase-encoding cDNAs for a beta-pinene synthase named Cl(-)betaPINS, a gamma-terpinene synthase named ClgammaTS, and two limonene synthases named Cl(+)LIMS1 and Cl(+)LIMS2 were recently isolated [J. Lücker et al., Eur. J. Biochem. 269 (2002) 3160]. The aim of our work in this study was to identify domains within these monoterpene synthase enzymes determining the product specificity. Domain swapping experiments between Cl(-)betaPINS and ClgammaTS and between Cl(+)LIMS2 and ClgammaTS were conducted. We found that within the C-terminal domain of these monoterpene synthases, a region comprising 200 amino acids, of which 41 are different between Cl(-)betaPINS and ClgammaTS, determines the specificity for the formation of beta-pinene or gamma-terpinene, respectively, while another region localized further downstream is required for a chimeric enzyme to yield products in the same ratio as in the wild-type ClgammaTS. For Cl(+)LIMS2, the two domains together appear to be sufficient for its enzyme specificity, but many chimeras were inactive probably due to the low homology with ClgammaTS. Molecular modeling was used to further pinpoint the amino acids responsible for the differences in product specificity of ClgammaTS and Cl(-)betaPINS.},

Nicotiana benthamiana is deployed at commercial scale for production of therapeutic proteins. Here the potential of this plant is explored for rapid production of precursors of artemisinin, a sesquiterpenoid compound that is used for malaria treatment. Biosynthetic genes leading to artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin, were combined and expressed in N. benthamiana by agro-infiltration. The first committed precursor of artemisinin, amorpha-4,11-diene, was produced upon infiltration of a construct containing amorpha-4,11-diene synthase, accompanied by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Amorpha-4,11-diene was detected both in extracts and in the headspace of the N. benthamiana leaves. When the amorphadiene oxidase CYP71AV1 was co-infiltrated with the amorphadiene-synthesizing construct, the amorpha-4,11-diene levels strongly decreased, suggesting it was oxidized. Surprisingly, no anticipated oxidation products, such as artemisinic acid, were detected upon GC-MS analysis. However, analysis of leaf extracts with a non-targeted metabolomics approach, using LC-QTOF-MS, revealed the presence of another compound, which was identified as artemisinic acid-12-β-diglucoside. This compound accumulated to 39.5 mg x kg(-1) fwt. Apparently the product of the heterologous pathway that was introduced, artemisinic acid, is further metabolized efficiently by glycosyl transferases that are endogenous to N. benthamiana. This work shows that agroinfiltration of N. bentamiana can be used as a model to study the production of sesquiterpenoid pharmaceutical compounds. The interaction between the ectopically introduced pathway and the endogenous metabolism of the plant is discussed.},

Plant genomes often encode a number of related terpene synthases, which can produce very different terpenes. The relationship between TPS sequence and resulting terpene product is not completely understood. In this work we describe two TPSs from the Camphor tree Cinnamomum camphora (L.) Presl. One of these, CiCaMS, acts as a monoterpene synthase (monoTPS), and mediates the production of myrcene, while the other, CiCaSSy, acts as a sesquiterpene synthase (sesquiTPS), and catalyses the production of α-santalene, β-santalene and trans-α-bergamotene. Interestingly, these enzymes share 97% DNA sequence identity and differ only in 22 amino acid residues out of 553. To understand which residues are essential for the catalysis of monoterpenes resp. sesquiterpenes, a number of hybrid synthases were prepared, and supplemented by a set of single-residue variants. These were tested for their ability to produce monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes by in vivo production of sesquiterpenes in E. coli, and by in vitro enzyme assays. This analysis pinpointed three residues in the sequence which could mediate the change in product specificity from a monoterpene synthase to a sesquiterpene synthase. Another set of three residues defined the sesquiterpene product profile, including the ratios between sesquiterpene products.},

In this study we introduced Rosea1 (ROS1, a MYB type) and Delila (DEL, a bHLH type), into Nicotiana benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration. ROS1 and DEL form a pair of well-characterized TFs from Snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus), which specifically induce anthocyanin accumulation when expressed in tomato fruit. In N. benthamiana, robust induction of a single anthocyanin, delphinidin-3-rutinoside (D3R) was observed after expression of both ROS1 and DEL. Surprisingly in addition to D3R, a range of additional metabolites were also strongly and specifically up-regulated upon expression of ROS1 and DEL. Except for the D3R, these induced compounds were not derived from the flavonoid pathway. Most notable among these are nornicotine conjugates with butanoyl, hexanoyl, and octanoyl hydrophobic moieties, and phenylpropanoid-polyamine conjugates such as caffeoyl putrescine. The defensive properties of the induced molecules were addressed in bioassays using the tobacco specialist lepidopteran insect Manduca sexta. Our study showed that the effect of ROS1 and DEL expression in N. benthamiana leaves extends beyond the flavonoid pathway. Apparently the same transcription factor may regulate different secondary metabolite pathways in different plant species.},

The current production of indole based on isolation from coal tar is non-sustainable and its isolation from plants is often unprofitable due to low yields. To offer an alternative to the conventional production, biosynthesis of indole has been studied recently. A glucose-based indole production was achieved by employing the Corynebacterium glutamicum tryptophan synthase α-subunit (TrpA) or indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase (IGL) from wheat Triticum aestivum in a genetically-engineered C. glutamicum strain. In addition, a highly efficient bioconversion process using C. glutamicum heterologously expressing tryptophanase gene (tnaA) from Providencia rettgeri as a biocatalyst was developed. In this work, de novo indole production from glucose was enabled by expressing the P. rettgeri tnaA in a tryptophan-producing C. glutamicum strain.

With these tests no difference was found between algal oil and fish oil. The nonhydrolysed algal oils and fish oil showed a much lower toxic effect on cell viability, and cell proliferation in Caco-2 cells than the hydrolysed oils and the free fatty acids (FFAs). Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; C20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; C22:6n-3) were used as samples for comparison with the tested hydrolysed and nonhydrolysed oils. The hydrolysed samples showed comparative toxicity as the free fatty acids and no difference between algal and fish oil. Oxidative stress was shown to play a role in the antiproliferative properties of EPA and DHA, as alpha-tocopherol could partially reverse the EPA/DHA-induced effects.

Q-TOF MSMS is a mass spectrometric approach for sequencing peptides and proteins. In our study it was applied to recombinant (r)Mal d 1, rBet v 1a and rBet v 1d, and natural (n)Mal d 1 from fruits of Malus domestica, cultivar Granny Smith. Q-TOF MSMS allowed sequencing of about 70% of all amino acids in Mal d 1 and about 60% of those in Bet v 1. Mixing experiments with rBet v 1 isoforms and with rMal d 1 and nMal d 1 revealed that the technique allows identification of isoforms in mixtures down to a level of at least 5%. Recombinant Mal d 1 was identified as a Mal d 1a representative, whereas Granny Smith apples were shown to contain Mal d 1b-like allergen isoforms. In this apple cultivar hitherto unreported modifications of Mal d 1b were identified. Q-TOF MSMS allowed semiquantitative measurement of allergen at the femtomole to picomole level. Q-TOF MSMS is a powerful tool to find out whether an allergen isoform, detected at the cDNA level, is really expressed in quantities relevant for the allergic patient.},

Fish bone perforation as a cause of chronic abdominal pain after LRYGP has rarely been reported. The unusual case of a 54year old female presenting with recurrent episodes of postprandial pain 2 years after LRYGP is reported. Previous radiological and endoscopic investigations did not reveal any abnormality and after the most recent clinical presentation, a laparoscopic exploration was performed. A protruding fish bone at the biliary-digestive junction was discovered intra-operatively and successfully extracted. Dense adhesions between the involved intestinal loops were lysed in an attempt to improve intestinal transit and subsequently relieve post-prandial pain. This case highlights the possibility of a missed fish bone perforation causing chronic postprandial abdominal pain and discomfort in a patient with a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass anatomy. Foreign body perforation is a rare cause of abdominal pain after gastric bypass that should be considered when evaluating chronic abdominal pain symptoms after LRYGP.},

To test this hypothesis, relationships were investigated between the spatial orientation of the jaw muscles and the craniofacial morphology. Computer reconstructions of the external shape of the jaw muscles of 30 adult males with a normal skull were made with the use of serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The orientation of the jaw muscles was defined by a regression line through the centroids of the serial cross-sections. Sagittal and frontal projections of the moment arms of the muscles were measured with respect to the centre of the ipsilateral condyle. Craniofacial morphology was analysed three-dimensionally using lateral head films and coronal MRI scans. The cephalometric data were analysed statistically using regression and factor analyses. Six cephalometric factors with Eigen values higher than 1 were correlated with jaw muscle orientation and moment arm data, using a multiple regression analysis. The anterior face height factor was significantly correlated with the orientation of the jaw opening muscles in the sagittal plane but was not significantly correlated with the orientation of the mandibular elevators. The sagittal moment arms of the mandibular elevators showed significant correlations with the factors describing the gonial angle and the posterior face height. It was concluded that the variation of spatial orientation of the human jaw closing muscles is predominantly associated with the variation of mandibular morphology (expressed by the gonial angle) and the posterior face height. The orientation of the jaw opening muscles shows significant relationships with anterior vertical craniofacial dimensions. The hypothesis that persons with an increased anterior face height have relatively oblique orientated jaw elevators was rejected.},

There were episodes of deterioration following infections and minor head traumas, and these could results in unexplained coma. In eight patients with advanced disease, MRI revealed a diffuse cerebral hemispheric leukoencephalopathy, in which increasing areas of the abnormal white matter had a signal intensity close to that of CSF on all pulse sequences. In one patient in the early stages of disease, initial MRI showed diffusely abnormal cerebral white matter, which only reached the signal characteristics of CSF at a later stage. In the patients in whom the disease was advanced, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the white matter showed an almost complete disappearance of all normal signals and the presence of glucose and lactate, compatible with the presence of mainly CSF and little brain tissue. Spectra of the cortex were much better preserved. However, in addition to the normal resonances, there were signals representing lactate and glucose. MRS of the white matter in the patient whose disease was at an early stage was much less abnormal. Autopsy in one patient confirmed the presence of extensive cystic degeneration of the cerebral white matter with reactive change and a preserved cortex. Typical involvement of pontine tegmental white matter was suggested by MRI and confirmed by autopsy. The disease probably has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, but the basic metabolic defect is not known.},

We reviewed the clinical, MR imaging, MR spectroscopic, and laboratory data. Clinically, the patients' diseases were characterized by variably disturbed early development followed by increasing extrapyramidal movement abnormalities, ataxia, and spasticity. Mental capacity was variably affected, but it appeared to be relatively preserved. Parents were not related, and none of their siblings were affected. No metabolic defect was found. Follow-up MR imaging demonstrated atrophy of the cerebral white matter, neostriatum, and cerebellum, which was most pronounced in the most clinically severe cases. Single-voxel proton MR spectroscopic results were normal in the parietal cortex. In the cerebral white matter, myo-inositol and creatine levels were elevated; this finding was compatible with gliosis. N-acetylaspartate and choline levels were normal, suggesting that neither axonal loss nor active demyelination occurred. Proton MR spectroscopic imaging revealed relatively decreased N-acetylaspartate levels in the frontal region. The uniform and highly characteristic MR imaging findings, in combination with the similarities in the clinical findings, provide evidence of a distinct nosologic entity. The acronym H-ABC is offered to indicate patients sharing these clinical and MR imaging features.},

We used the FLAIR sequence to study patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) at 0.6 T. So far, a very long TR (and long acquisition time) has been used in a fully relaxed (FR-FLAIR) system. To speed up the FLAIR sequences, we used a shorter TR, and demonstrated that complete CSF suppression can be maintained with partial saturation (PS-FLAIR) by reducing TI at the same time. The introduction of partial saturation, however, reduced the contrast between lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). Suboptimal CSF suppression therefore had to be accepted to maintain sufficient lesion to NAWM contrast. Using a TE of 60 ms, the PS-FLAIR and FR-FLAIR performed equally well in the detection of MS-lesions, although the former provided poorer CSF suppression. Both FLAIR sequences, however, provided poorer constrast between lesions and NAWM compared to conventional spin-echo sequences. Although the long acquisition time of the FLAIR sequence can be reduced by using partial saturation, complete CSF suppression and good lesion to NAWM contrast are incompatible at short TRs. Using a TE of 60 ms, conventional spin-echo sequences detect more lesions and provide better contrast between lesions and NAWM than FLAIR sequences in MS patients.},

The total area of the hyperintense lesions on the initial T2-weighted images showed a weak correlation with the Expanded Disability Status Scale score at entry (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [SRCC] = 0.30; 0.02 < p < 0.05). The increase in disability showed a positive correlation (SRCC = 0.19) with the increase in hyperintense lesion load on the T2-weighted SE images, but this correlation did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09), probably because of lack of clinical progression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The purpose of the study was to determine the normal progress of myelination on MRI in that age range. T1- and T2-weighted images of the brain were assessed for changes in signal intensity of white matter relative to gray matter. Multiple sites in the brainstem, cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres were assessed separately. The findings were correlated with the ages of the infants. As judged from relative signal intensities, myelin was present at the post-conceptional age of 30-34 weeks in the following structures: tegmentum pontis (in particular medial lemniscus), superior and inferior colliculi, decussation of the superior cerebellar peduncles, crura cerebri, ventrolateral thalamus, lateral globus pallidus, dorsolateral putamen, dentate nucleus, middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, vermis cerebelli, cortex bordering the central sulcus and hippocampus. Little progress in myelination was noticed up to the post-conceptional age of 46 weeks. Between 34 and 46 weeks, myelin appeared in the lateral part of the posterior limb of the internal capsule and in the central part of the corona radiata and became more prominently visible in the cortex bordering the central sulcus.},

In this sample of 13 pairs of cases with MS and epilepsy and controls with MS without epilepsy we found statistically higher cumulated cortical-subcortical lesion loads in the cases than in the controls (Wilcoxon, P = 0.036). Total lesion loads (cortical-subcortical plus deep white matter loads) did not differ significantly (P > 0.1) between cases and controls. The relative risk for seizures as determined by the odds ratio of a cortical-subcortical lesion load of > or = 20 was 8.8 (chi 2 = 5.23, P 0.025), the odds ratio of a large (> 1 cm) cortico-subcortical lesion was 4.7 (chi 2 = 4.9, P < 0.05), while the 2 MR criteria combined show an odds ratio of 19.2 (chi 2 = 8.0, P < 0.005). We conclude that: first, the presence of cortical-subcortical lesions in part accounts for the occurrence of seizures in MS patients; second, due to the substantial overlap of MR imaging scores between cases and controls the ultimate use of these MR imaging findings in the management of individual patients or in the organizations of trials should depend on the expected benefit of the treatment. If the benefit is only moderate or not known a cautious approach with exclusion of cases showing a substantial cortical-subcortical lesion load on MR imaging seems appropriate in trials with drugs, like 4-aminopyridine, that lower the epileptic threshold.},

We reviewed early MR scans of 18 neonates with suspected hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. Myelination could be evaluated with confidence using conventional MR imaging in all but 2 infants; however, the presence of myelin was very difficult to assess on FLAIR images. Overall, 53 lesions or groups of lesions were identified. The FLAIR technique was more sensitive in 11 of the lesions; especially (pre)cystic lesions could be identified much better and more cysts were found. Conventional MR imaging failed to identify 2 of the lesions and was more sensitive in 14 of the lesions; especially punctate hemorrhages and lesions in basal ganglia or thalami could be better determined. The FLAIR technique missed 3 of these lesions. In the remaining 28 lesions conventional MR and FLAIR images were equally diagnostic. The FLAIR technique and conventional MR imaging are complementary in detecting early sequelae of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonates. The FLAIR technique is not suitable for assessing myelination of the neonatal brain; therefore, FLAIR cannot replace conventional MR imaging.},

The function of the CC was studied using a neuropsychological battery and neurophysiological evaluation based on visual stimulation using a divided visual field paradigm. The total area of the CC in patients (mean 5.3 cm2) was significantly (P = 0.002) smaller than in controls (mean 6.6 cm2). Patients showed left ear extinction using the dichotic listening test and impaired name learning, which was correlated with atrophy of the splenium. There were no differences in interhemispheric transfer time between patients and controls. Marked atrophy of the CC can be encountered in relapsing-remitting MS patients. The associated cerebral disconnection correlated with atrophy of expected regions of the CC, thus supporting topographical organization.},

Histological proof was available for 8 of 11 tumours: six schwannomas and two plexiform neurofibromas. The other three tumours were thought to be schwannomas, because they were present in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 and followed the course of the trigeminal nerve. Uncommon MRI appearances were observed in three schwannomas and included a large intratumoral haemorrhage, a mainly low-signal appearance on T2-weighted images and a rim-enhancing, multicystic appearance. Only four of nine schwannomas caused trigeminal nerve symptoms, including two with large cystic components, one haemorrhagic and one solid tumor. Of the five schwannomas which did not cause any trigeminal nerve symptoms, two were large. Only one of the plexiform neurofibromas caused trigeminal nerve symptoms. Additional neurological symptoms and signs, not related to the trigeminal nerve, could be attributed to the location of the tumour in three patients.},

The size of the activated areas in the visual cortex and the increase in signal were measured. A reproducibility ratio for size (R[size]) and for location (R[overlap]) was calculated on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0. Activation was seen in 89% of the subjects. The size of the activated area was widely variable among subjects: mean, 460 +/- 284 mm2; range, 0 to 1029 mm2 in the first study in all volunteers. Signal increases ranged from 3.2% to 10.9%, with a mean of 6.6 +/- 1.7%. The mean values of intrasubject variability testing were R(size) = 0.83 +/- 0.16 and R(overlap) = 0.31 +/- 0.11.

All seven patients were born at term. Five of the seven patients had a clear history of severe perinatal asphyxia. All children had severe encephalopathic symptomatology, including spastic tetraplegia, extrapyramidal symptoms, and a mental deficit. The MR showed localized atrophy of the cortex and in addition cystic changes, gliosis, and tissue loss of the adjacent white matter. In all patients, the lesions were band shaped in the left-right direction and characteristically located in areas bordering the central sulcus. The segment of the corpus callosum underlying the affected area was always thin. In some patients, lesions were also found bilaterally in the occipital regions, hippocampus, and basal ganglia. The areas involved match the regions that are known to show active myelination on MR in the term neonate. Recognition of this specific pattern on MR in children with cerebral palsy enables the classification of such lesions as resulting from peri- or postnatal asphyxia, even if the perinatal history is unknown or equivocal, and makes other etiologies less likely.},

Also, the anteroposterior dimension of the brainstem was measured at the level of the pons in the authors' 6 patients and in 20 age-matched healthy control subjects. Furthermore, the MRIs were evaluated for associated congenital brain anomalies. The facial nerves were absent in all six patients despite residual function in some facial muscles. The authors confirmed brainstem hypoplasia but did not find tegmental calcifications. The anteroposterior dimension of the brainstem ranged between 17 and 25 mm vs 20 to 27 mm for controls. In three patients there were congenital abnormalities in the posterior fossa. The absent facial nerves on MRI and the unusual distribution of the facial weakness, which is characteristic of Möbius syndrome, suggests that other cranial nerves, possibly the trigeminal, hypoglossal, or glossopharyngeal nerve, aberrantly innervate some lower facial muscles. Radiologic findings support the notion that Möbius syndrome is part of a more complex congenital anomaly of the fossa posterior.},

Ulceration and rapid growth of a long-standing lesion of the dorsal hand prompted evaluation and treatment. Over the course of a year, three separate surgeries including digital amputations and metacarpal resections were required to manage this recurrent and invasive malignancy. Seven years post-operatively, our patient retained a full, painless range of motion arc of the left thumb and ability to grip utilizing a functional brace. Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the hand is not always straightforward. High rates of local recurrence require negative margins and diligent postoperative surveillance. Digital sparing therapy should be considered to minimize functional impairment and maximize cosmesis. However, aggressive treatment and amputation must be considered for advanced disease and if pursued, should focus on maximization of functional capacity as one of the treatment goals.},

Therefore, purpose of this systematic review is to compare mid- to long-term clinical outcomes of ABRR versus both the OL and the arthroscopic Latarjet (AL) procedures across a wide range of glenoid bone loss to further enhance surgical decision-making. A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, for studies published between 2014 and 2024. Studies that compared outcomes between ABRR and either OL or AL and had a minimum clinical follow-up of 2 years were included. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), range of motion (ROM), and recurrent instability, revision, and complication rates were collected. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Meta-analyses were conducted using R with the "Metafor" package. Of the 5,005 abstracts screened, 6 studies were included. Three hundred thirty-three patients underwent ABRR (mean age 27.3 ± 8.3 years, 22.4% female) and 468 underwent OL or AL (mean age 28.4 ± 9.2 years, 20.1% female). PROMs and ROM improved postoperatively across both groups but demonstrated high heterogeneity. The ABRR group had significantly higher single assessment numeric evaluation scores (92.5 ± 12 vs. 89.1 ± 12.2,  When compared across a wide range of glenoid bone loss levels, both ABRR and Latarjet procedures are effective for managing anterior shoulder instability, with comparably high PROMs and no significant differences in ROM. ABRR offers a safer surgical risk profile with significantly fewer complications and is a viable option in the appropriate patient population. However, there is likely a limit of glenoid bone loss at which ABRR may not be safely performed due to the elevated risk of recurrent instability.},

  abstract = {An identical syndrome of cerebral leukoencephalopathy and megalencephaly with infantile onset was discovered in 8 children, including 2 siblings. Neurological findings were initially normal or near normal, despite megalencephaly and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of severe white matter affection. Slowly progressive ataxia and spasticity developed, while intellectual functioning was preserved for years after onset of the disorder. MRI characteristics included diffuse abnormality in signal intensity and swelling of the cerebral hemispheral white matter with cyst-like spaces in the frontoparietal and anterior-temporal subcortical areas. MR spectra were relatively mildly abnormal. Screening for inborn errors, especially those that cause either megalencephaly or white matter disease or both was negative. A distinguishing feature of the present disorder is the apparently severe abnormality of the cerebral white matter as demonstrated by MRI, which contrasts with the remarkably slow course of functional deterioration.},

Forty-nine patients with ARM were investigated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); 24 preoperatively (preop) and 25 postoperatively (postop). Of this group, 17 patients had a high (or intermediate) ARM, 28 a low ARM, and 4 a cloacal malformation (CM). The evaluation of the imaging studies included the level and type of ARM (preop); the developmental state of the sphincter muscle complex (SMC); and the associated anomalies of spinal cord, spine, and urogenital system. The anomalies detected were ordered and related to recent embryologic observations in the caudal region. With MRI, the level of ARM was depicted effectively in 23 of 24 patients (96%) investigated preop, including 5 of 9 clinically proven fistulae in those with high ARM and CM (56%). Maldevelopment of the SMC was observed in 14 of 49 patients (29%). Associated anomalies of spinal cord and spine were found in 51% of patients, more frequently in those with high ARM, low ARM with fistulae, and cloacal malformations. Associated anomalies of the urogenital system were found in 37% of patients. As illustrated by the current study, MRI has become indispensable for the visualization of the nature of congenital ARM and associated anomalies. Moreover, MRI aids in understanding the morphology and pathogenesis of these complex congenital malformations. Based on the MRI and recent embryologic observations, a new and simplified classification of ARM is introduced, including a more appropriate nomenclature.},

Further work-up with CT and MRI showed a large retrogastric, retropancreatic cyst, herniating through the diaphragm in the mediastinum. As etiology was unsure, a laparoscopic cystectomy was performed. Histological examination showed a benign cyst of Mullerian origin. A review of the literature confirmed that extrapelvic Mullerian cysts are rare, with only 28 mediastinal cysts and 12 extrapelvic retroperitoneal cysts being described. Retroperitoneal Mullerian cysts outside the pelvis have infrequently been described in the literature. As correct preoperative diagnosis is seldom possible, surgical resection is the gold standard of treatment.},

This review article will focus primarily on the recent literature on ACS as well as the definitions and recommendations published by the World Society for the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. The definitions regarding increased IAP will be listed, followed by a brief but comprehensive overview of the different mechanisms of organ dysfunction associated with intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Measurement techniques for IAP will be discussed, as well as recommendations for organ function support in patients with IAH. Finally, surgical treatment and management of the open abdomen are briefly discussed, as well as some minimally invasive techniques to decrease IAP. The ACS was first described in surgical patients with abdominal trauma, bleeding, or infection, but in recent years ACS has also been described in patients with other pathologies such as burn injury and sepsis. Some of these so-called nonsurgical patients will require surgery to treat their ACS. This review article is intended to provide surgeons with a clear insight into the current state of knowledge regarding IAH, ACS, and the impact of IAP on the critically ill patient.},

The objective of this study is to evaluate if closure of the mesenteric defect and Petersen's space will decrease the rate of internal hernias compared to only closure of the mesenteric defect. A single-center retrospective descriptive study was performed. All patients with LRYGBP from 2011 till April 2017 were included. An antecolic technique was used with closure of the mesenteric defect with a non-absorbable running suture between 2011 and October 2013 (group A), and from November 2013, we added closure of the Petersen defect (group B). From a total of 3124 patients, 116 patients (3.71%) had an exploratory laparoscopy due to suspicion of bowel obstruction, but in only 67 (2.14%) patients, an IH was found. Preoperative CT predicted the diagnosis in only 73%. In group A, including 1586 patients, 53 (3.34%) were diagnosed with an internal hernia: 39 at Petersen's space and 14 at the mesenteric defect. The mean time interval was 24.2 months and the mean BMI 25.7 kg/m After descriptive analysis, these results can provide strong recommendation of closure of the mesenteric defect and Petersen's space, as we notice a tendency to lower incidence of internal hernias.},

A systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases was conducted for all studies published between January 2015 and March 2025 reporting RTS or return to preinjury level (RTPL) following surgical treatment for anterior shoulder instability. Exclusion criteria included non-English studies, studies reporting less than a 2-year follow-up, and studies reporting any shoulder instability other than anterior, including atraumatic instability. The risk of bias was assessed, and data were extracted. Heterogeneity in procedure-specific RTS outcomes was qualitatively assessed through subgroup analyses of study, patient, and surgical characteristics. A total of 123 studies encompassing 10,992 athletes were included. Across 9,581 patients, RTS rates ranged from 50% to 100%, and RTPL ranged from 19.4% to 100%. RTS was most consistent following open iliac crest (100%) and open Bankart repair (91.6%-100%), while wider ranges were observed after arthroscopic Bankart (50%-100%) and open Latarjet (50%-100%). RTPL exhibited rates of 100% after open iliac crest and 19.4% to 97.1% after open Latarjet. Female athletes had higher and more consistent RTS (91.4%-100%) and RTPL (74.1%-76.9%) compared to males (RTS, 73.9%-100%; RTPL, 39.4%-97.1%). Ranges of RTS and RTPL narrowed in studies with a prospective design (RTS, 87%-98%; RTPL, 38%-97%), revision procedures (RTS, 77.9%-100%; RTPL, 42.9%-95.4%), and among elite athletes (RTS, 81.8%-100%). Patients with >20% glenoid bone loss exhibited narrower RTPL (78.3%-95.4%) than those with <20% (70%-100%). Sport type, athlete level, and bone defect tracking status further influenced RTS variability. Anterior shoulder stabilization procedures lead to high, though varied, reported RTS and return to preinjury rates across all studied cohorts. Ranges of RTS rates are influenced by procedure type, clinical follow-up duration, athletic level, and revision surgery status. Level IV, systematic review of Level I to IV evidence.},

The degree of hypointensity was scored semiquantitatively by two blinded observers in reference to normal-appearing white matter. Signal intensities of the lesions and the normal-appearing white matter were measured to obtain contrast ratios. Hematoxylin-eosin stain was used to assess degree of matrix destruction (decrease of density of the neuropil) and cellularity of a lesion, Klüver-Barrera stain for degree of demyelination, Bodian stain for axonal density, and immunostaining of glial fibrillary acid protein for reactive astrocytes and fibrillary gliosis. Nineteen lesions were selected for analysis. Nearly all lesions were compatible with the chronic MS plaque: hypocellularity, absence of myelinated axons, in the presence of reactive astrocytes. Contrast ratios of the lesions were highly correlated (R = -0.90; p < 0.01), with degree of hypointensity scored semiquantitatively. Degree of hypointensity on T1-weighted SE images did not correlate with degree of demyelination or number of reactive astrocytes, but was associated with axonal density (R = -0.71; p = 0.001). A trend was found with degree of matrix destruction (R = 0.45; p = 0.052). We conclude that, in our limited sample, hypointense lesions seen on T1-weighted SE MR images are associated histopathologically with severe tissue destruction, including axonal loss. Our results need to be substantiated in a larger study on more varied patient material to evaluate the use of hypointense lesions as a surrogate marker of persistent deficit in MS patients.},

The diagnostic criteria used currently for this disease include an early-childhood onset of neurologic deterioration. Clinical, MRI, and spectroscopic findings of five patients were reviewed who fulfilled all inclusion criteria for the disease of vanishing white matter, apart from the age at onset. In one patient histopathologic findings were documented. Onset of the disease was in late childhood or adolescence in four patients, and one patient was still presymptomatic in his early twenties. The course of the disease tended to be milder than in the patients with early-childhood onset. MRI revealed a diffuse cerebral hemispheric leukoencephalopathy with evidence of white matter rarefaction. MRS of the abnormal white matter showed a serious decrease but not complete disappearance of all "normal" signals and, in some patients, the presence of extra signals from lactate and glucose. Changes in relative spectral peak heights were compatible with axonal damage or loss, but not with active demyelination or substantial gliosis. Autopsy in one patient confirmed the extensive rarefaction of the cerebral white matter. There was a commensurate loss of axons and myelin sheaths. Within the brainstem, pontine lesions were present, also involving the central tegmental tracts--a phenomenon previously described in early-onset patients. Later onset does occur in the disease of vanishing white matter, and both MRS and histopathology are compatible with a primary axonopathy rather than primary demyelination.},

The patients included in this study met clinical and CT-scan criteria as described in this study, underwent cine phase-contrast MR imaging prior to placement of a CSF shunt, and had a follow-up 12 months after the operation. Claustrophobic patients, patients with a pacemaker or extremely agitated patients were excluded. Normal Flux was calculated in each patients, as the average difference in caudal and rostral flux (Fdiff) +2 times standard deviation (0.97 cc/sec) [2]. The clinical outcome was measured with a modified scale of activities of daily living (ADL) as described by Rankin. Of the 16 patients, 8 could not be evaluated due to restlessness during MR measurements, disabling cerebral vascular accidents or death before the end of the follow-up period. Of the remaining 8 patients, 5 had a normal flux, of which only one improved. Two patients had a Fdiff twice the normal range, which improved in both patients. One patient had no measurable flux, consistent with an aqueduct stenosis; he too improved. Overall, there was a concordance of MR findings with final outcome after shunting in 7 out of 8 patients. This pilot study, therefore, support the need to further evaluate flow with MR imaging techniques to select patients with shunt responsive NPH.},

Two interpreters scored the images for focal lesions and for diffuse abnormalities. Cross-sectional areas of the cords were measured at the C-2 level. No abnormalities were found in any of the control subjects nor in two of the patients. Fifty (83%) of 60 patients had focal lesions. Diffuse abnormality and focal lesions were found in 50% of patients with secondary-progressive MS, in 25% of patients with primary-progressive disease, and in 18% of patients with relapsing-remitting disease. Diffuse abnormality without focal lesions was found in seven patients with primary-progressive MS and in one patient with secondary-progressive MS. Patients with diffuse abnormalities had a smaller cross-sectional area of the spinal cord and they suffered from more disability than did patients without diffuse abnormalities. The MR appearance of the spinal cord differs among clinical subgroups of MS. Diffuse abnormality of the spinal cord is associated with a progressive clinical course and greater disability.},

The influence on structural brain development has never been evaluated. In a prospective, double-blind study, 42 formula-fed premature infants were randomized to be fed either a standard preterm formula without long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids or an identical formula supplemented with docosahexaenoic acid (0.015 g/100 ml) and arachidonic acid (0.031 g/100 ml). Infants with significant cerebral damage, retinopathy, chronic disease or feeding problems were excluded. Follow-up was focused on assessment of cerebral myelination by MRI.

It was found that progress of myelination, mental and motor development and latencies of visual evoked potentials were not positively influenced by supplementation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. At each test age, visual acuity was slightly better in the supplemented infants than in the non-supplemented infants, but the difference never reached significance level Supplementation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids did not have a demonstrable positive influence on structural brain maturation.

Feature 1 was present in 14 patients and was best appreciated on the T2-weighted images in planes parallel to the long axes of the hippocampi. Feature 2, present in 12 patients, and feature 6, present in 9 patients, were optimally seen in the coronal planes and on the inversion-recovery sequences in particular. Feature 3, present in 12 patients, was optimally seen on the coronal T2-weighted images. Feature 4, seen in 11 patients, was equally well seen in all planes (transverse, coronal, and parallel to the long axes of the hippocampi). Feature 5, seen in 10 patients, was best appreciated on the T2-weighted images in the planes of the long axes of the hippocampi. Histologic investigation of the temporal lobe white matter in the 10 patients with feature 5 demonstrated on the MR scan showed abnormalities in 7 cases. Oligodendroglia cell clusters were found in 6, with concomitant corpora amylacea in 1 case and perivascular macrophages with pigment a sole finding in another case. Of the six features found in cases of mesial temporal sclerosis on MR, increased hippocampal signal intensity is the most consistent. A decreased gray-white matter demarcation in the temporal lobe parenchyma is also a frequent feature of this disease. A combination of multiple scanning planes results in an optimal demonstration of lesions.},

We initiated a multiinstitutional survey of MR abnormalities in both presumed and confirmed cases of Alexander disease to assess the possibility of an MR-based diagnosis. MR imaging studies in three patients with an autopsy-based diagnosis of Alexander disease were analyzed to define MR criteria for the diagnosis. These criteria were then applied to 217 children with leukoencephalopathy of unknown origin. Five MR imaging criteria were defined: extensive cerebral white matter changes with frontal predominance, a periventricular rim with high signal on T1-weighted images and low signal on T2-weighted images, abnormalities of basal ganglia and thalami, brain stem abnormalities, and contrast enhancement of particular gray and white matter structures. Four of the five criteria had to be met for an MR imaging-based diagnosis. In a retrospective analysis of the MR studies of the 217 patients, 19 were found who fulfilled these criteria. No other essentially new MR abnormalities were found in these patients. In four of the 19 patients, subsequent histologic confirmation was obtained. The clinical symptomatology was the same in the patients with and without histologic confirmation and correlated well with the MR abnormalities. MR abnormalities were in close agreement with the known histopathologic findings of Alexander disease. The defined criteria are sufficient for an in vivo MR imaging diagnosis of Alexander disease; only in atypical cases is a brain biopsy still necessary for a definitive diagnosis.},

  abstract = {In the literature, some controversy still exists about the normal and abnormal development of the human anorectum. Therefore, a three-dimensional and histological study was performed on human embryos. In early anorectal development (< or = 49 days postfertilization), the cloaca plays a crucial role, separated from the amniotic cavity by its cloacal membrane. In the cloaca, the yolk sac/primitive hindgut and allantois/primitive urogenital sinus enter. During the embryonic caudal folding process, incorporation of these structures occurs, including their surrounding extraembryonic mesoderm, which fuses to form the urorectal septum. Consequently, this septum does not grow in the direction of the cloacal membrane, and fusion of these structures is likewise never observed. The cloaca remains as such until the cloacal membrane ruptures by apoptotic cell death. The dorsal part of the cloaca then becomes part of the amniotic cavity, and is by no means involved in the development of the anorectum. The tip of the urorectal septum will become the perineal area. Soon after rupture of the cloacal membrane, during late anorectal development (> or = 49 days postfertilization), a secondary occlusion of the anorectal canal occurs, first due to adhesion, followed by formation of an epithelial "plug" at the level of the anal orifice. Recanalization, by apoptotic cell death, of this secondary occluded anal orifice occurs later during development. Based on these embryological observations, congenital anorectal malformations with an abnormal communication to the exterior are best explained as early embryonic defects. The abnormal communications, usually called fistulae, should be regarded as ectopic anal orifices. Anorectal malformations with the anus in normal position are best explained as late embryonic defects.},

MRI of the brain typically shows white matter swelling, but does not enable differentiation of the various underlying disorders. The aim of this article is optimisation of the diagnostic value of MRI in leukoencephalopathy accompanied by swelling. MRI-based inclusion criteria were met by 20 patients in our database. The images were analysed using a detailed scoring list. In 13 of the 20 patients the clinical diagnosis was known (11 definite and 2 probable diagnoses). Characteristic MRI abnormalities could be defined in these patients. Of the 7 patients without a diagnosis, 5 had identical MRI abnormalities: diffuse hemisphere swelling and typical cysts in frontoparietal subcortical white matter and the tips of the temporal lobes. The clinical picture was also similar in these patients, suggesting a similar disease.},

A sequential cohort of infants with periventricular densities on neonatal ultrasound was studied with neonatal MRI. Images of 46 infants with a mean gestational age of 31 weeks were obtained at a mean age of 20 days after birth and at 1 1/2 years. To establish agreement between the neonatal and follow-up MRI (general, motor, and visual scores), the weighted Cohen's kappa test was used. To establish the predictive power of neonatal MRI with respect to the neurologic indices at the age of 1 1/2 years, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. There was a moderately good to good agreement between the general, motor, and visual neonatal and follow-up MRI scores: weighted kappa = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.44 - 0.74), 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72 - 0.93), and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56 - 0.84), respectively. Neonatal MRI scores provided a good prediction of the three neurological outcome measures (developmental delay, cerebral palsy, and cerebral visual impairment): sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were high, with little difference between the three MRI scores. The 32 patients with (nearly) normal neonatal MRI scores were neurologically (nearly) normal at 1 1/2 years on all three outcome measures, whereas 8 patients with seriously abnormal neonatal MRI scores were neurologically abnormal at 1 1/2 years on all three outcome measures. Neonatal MRI is able to predict the precise localization and size of perinatal leukomalacia on follow-up MRI and provides a good prediction of neurological outcome at 1 1/2 years.},

The purpose was to determine the feasibility of functional MR imaging during a learning task in healthy elderly volunteers and in patients with Alzheimer's disease and to test our hypothesis that brain activation is decreased in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with control volunteers. In 12 patients with mild to moderate forms of Alzheimer's disease and 10 elderly control volunteers, activation of the MTL memory system was studied. We used two learning tasks that required the encoding of new information into memory. After the functional MR imaging experiment, participants were tested for recognition of the encoded objects. In the elderly control volunteers, activation during memory encoding was observed in medial and lateral temporal lobe structures (fusiform, parietal and occipital parts, and hippocampal formation) and in the frontal cortex, as reported previously in studies of young control volunteers. Focusing on the MTL, we observed that activation was significantly decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with control volunteers in the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus bilaterally during the first encoding task but not during the second (P < .05, uncorrected). Functional MR imaging with a learning task seems feasible in elderly volunteers and in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The measured functional signal decrease in MTL areas warrants further exploration of the (early) diagnostic usefulness of functional MR imaging in cases of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias.},

MR images of 92 patients (55 male, 37 female; mean age, 9.3 years) with a leukoencephalopathy were examined by using a scoring list of 68 items. Seven major categories were defined according to the predominant location of the white matter abnormalities. Statistical analysis was used to assess the validity of these seven categories. Statistical analysis results showed that the seven categories could be well distinguished by either using the defining variables initially accepted as inclusion criteria or selecting a few other variables found to have discriminating value. The additional variables confirmed that the categories are essentially distinct and vary systematically with regard to items other than the inclusion criteria. The existence of two recently defined leukoencephalopathies was confirmed, but no consistent evidence of other new disease entities could be provided. Establishing these seven categories helps in the interpretation of individual studies by demonstrating features that the patient has in common with other patients, and it may facilitate further research on homogeneous subgroups of patients and allow pooling of data across multiple centers.},

The MR imaging included T1-weighted and dual-echo T2-weighted images before, and T1-weighted images after, gadopentetate dimeglumine injection. The contrast between tumour and ipsilateral vitreous strongly increased (57 %) after gadolinium on T1-weighted images (p = 0.004). Tumour was strongly hypointense as compared with ipsilateral vitreous in all patients using heavily T2-weighted (TE = 120 ms) images (p = 0.001). The estimated T2 of tumour (mean 96 + 14 ms) did not correlate with histological grading or degree of calcification. Unenhanced T1-weighted MR images rightfully excluded extrascleral growth in 16 of 16 cases, but its presence was confirmed after enucleation in only one of 2 abnormal MR scans. Invasion of the optic nerve behind the cribriform plate was confirmed in 2 of 3 abnormal gadolinium-enhanced MR scans, but also in 1 of the 15 cases in which MR images were normal. The T2-weighted images were useful in assessing retinal detachment. We conclude that heavily T2-weighted images, unenhanced T1-weighted images and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR images are complementary in characterizing and staging retinoblastoma.},

In this study, we used a questionnaire to determine the frequency of local and systemic adverse drug reactions in our patients who were treated with LIT between 2017 and 2020 (n = 302). In addition, we asked about pregnancies and/or live births after LIT in a 2-year follow-up (n = 140). Most of the patients reported the occurrence of mild local adverse drug reactions in a period of less than 4 weeks: Over 75% reported moderate erythema, itching or swelling, over 10% erythema, itching or swelling as more pronounced adverse drug reaction. Blistering was specified in 10% of the cases. Serious adverse drug reactions or adverse events were not described. In the follow-up, 69% of our patients stated a pregnancy after LIT, and 50% a life birth. Overall, LIT represents a well-tolerated therapy for couples with unexplained infertility, however, more evidence is needed on the benefits.},

Second, to evaluate the effect of incidental magnetization transfer (MT) effect on hypointense lesions in multislice T1 spin echo (SE) imaging. In 49 lesions, from 10 MS patients, MT ratio (MTR), T1 relaxation time, signal intensity (SI) on T1-weighted SE images normalized to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), and SI normalized to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were measured. Differences in contrast of hypointense lesions were measured between single slice and multislice imaging. MTR correlated significantly (p < .001) with longitudinal relaxation rates (1/T1) (r = 0.84), SI normalized to NAWM (r = 0.78), and SI normalized to CSF (r = 0.75). The degree of reduction in contrast, caused by multislice imaging, correlated significantly with MTR of lesions (r = 0.60, p < .001), leading to reduction of hypointense lesion load (p < .01). We conclude that all four MR markers for severe tissue destruction are highly correlated when applied to selected hypointense lesions on T1-weighted SE images. Due to "incidental" off-resonance excitation, contrast and hypointense lesion load will be reduced in multislice T1-weighted SE images.},

Thirteen patients with definite MS received a total of 31 courses of methylprednisolone over an average period of 50 weeks. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI was obtained before and after treatment, then at monthly intervals, using a standardised repositioning and imaging protocol. Two experienced readers in conference defined the number of active (gadolinium-enhancing and new or enlarging nonenhancing) lesions. We detected 609 active lesions on 195 examinations. Directly after treatment the reduction in the number of enhancing lesions was 78%, indicating restoration of the BBB and suppression of inflammation. It was uncommon for a lesion which stopped enhancing to show enhancement on a subsequent examination. No beneficial effect was observed on the rate of disappearance of related abnormalities on T2-weighted images, indicating persistent change such as oedema, cellular infiltration or demyelination. Moreover, in 89% of cases, an increase in the number of active lesions was observed before new clinical activity, if any, was observed (on average 52% earlier). MRI enabled us to demonstrate that the duration of the effect of methylprednisolone treatment is temporary (on average 9.7 weeks).},

Abnormalities of the spinal cord and spine were found with MRI in 20 patients (46.5%); caudal regression syndrome in 10, tethered cord in two, a combination of both in three, and other spinal anomalies in five. These anomalies were found in 30% of the patients with low anorectal malformations, and in 50% with high anorectal malformations. In patients with urogenital malformations, MRI more often showed spinal anomalies (13/21, 62%) than in patients without (7/22, 32%). In high anorectal malformations, defaecation was more often a problem in patients with spinal anomalies (12/15, 80%) than in patients without (2/8, 25%). Spinal anomalies in the lumbosacral region were found with MRI in 46.5% of patients with anorectal malformations. Since presence of these anomalies seems to be related to clinical outcome, MRI should be performed routinely in all such patients.},

A median number of two clinical relapses/patient occurred of which a median of one was treated with steroids. A median of 1.59 new lesions/scan/patient was detected (range 0-8). The total number of new active lesions correlated significantly with study period relapses (SRCC = 0.72, P = 0.023). Computer simulations using the bootstrap technique yielded mostly lower power values for a parallel groups design than in previous studies except for short follow-periods in larger samples. In this-sample the open cross-over design was found to be between 20 and 40% more powerful. Results of power-calculations are clearly sample dependent implying that for treatment trial monitoring using MRI in relapsing-remitting MS conservative sample size estimates are to be used. In an active patient group open cross-over trial designs could be a very powerful alternative to parallel groups design.},

Its occurrence in the lower leg muscle compartments is most common, but other locations are less well known and the pathophysiology is not completely understood. In motocross racers, chronic exertional compartment syndrome can occur in the muscles of the lower arm. Currently, the only accepted treatment of correctly diagnosed chronic exertional compartment syndrome is surgical release of the fascia, which successfully relieves pain and allows patients to return to full activity. Open decompression is considered as the gold standard of treatment. This clinical paper describes our new endoscopic technique and investigates the functional outcome after surgery. We report on a series of 154 chronic exertional compartment syndromes afflicted motocross racers treated with an endoscopic release of the lower arm muscles. An MRI scan before and after strenuous exercise of the hand flexors (repetitive grip until exhaustion for 15 min) was performed to confirm the clinical diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome. Symptom severity before and after surgery was assessed using a visual analogue scale. Preoperative symptom severity scores were 1.1 ± 0.3 before exercise and 7.4 ± 1.5 after exercise. Post-operatively, these were 1.0 ± 0.2 and 1.7 ± 0.9. The pre- versus post-operative symptom scores after exercise were significantly different (p < 0.0001). No perioperative complications occurred, and at 6 weeks, all of the racers resumed their sportive activities. It can be concluded that endoscopic release of the superficial compartment of the forearms of motocross racers diagnosed with chronic exertional compartment syndrome is a valuable treatment option, with mild post-operative pain and fast recovery.},

Aqueductal velocity and flux in old controls was higher than in young controls, but the differences were not significant. For all controls together, the averaged peak velocity was 4.2 +/- 1.5 cm/s in rostral and -7.8 +/- 4.9 cm/s in caudal direction; for the flux it was 0.16 +/- 0.10 cm3/s in rostral and -0.29 +/- 0.19 cm3/s in caudal direction. Phase-contrast measurements were significantly related to flow-void on modulus MR images, but not with ventricular size or cortical atrophy. The present technique avoids underestimation of aqueductal flow, and therefore reveals higher aqueductal velocity and flux values than previous studies. Factors other than age or atrophy seem to determine aqueductal CSF flow.},

Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images in 24 patients with symptoms (mean age at time of imaging, 37 years; mean disease duration, 18 years) were reviewed for site and frequency of brain, spinal cord, and Achilles tendon involvement. Two patients died, and imaging findings were compared with postmortem neuropathologic findings. Apart from nonspecific supratentorial atrophy and deep white matter changes, more typical hyperintense lesions were seen on T2-weighted images in the dentate nucleus (in 79% of patients), globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and inferior olive and extended into adjacent white matter as disease progressed. In these locations, lipid crystal clefts and perivascular macrophages, neuronal loss, demyelination, fibrosis, and reactive astrocytosis were found at microscopic examination. Hypointensity was sometimes found on T2-weighted images in the dentate nucleus and was related to deposition of hemosiderin and calcifications. CT depicted fewer lesions; all had low attenuation, except for the calcifications. Spinal cord MR imaging revealed increased signal intensity in the lateral and dorsal columns on T2-weighted images. Achilles tendon xanthomas displayed intermediate signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. The typical pattern of MR imaging findings reflects the classic histopathologic findings and should prompt the diagnosis of CTX.},

The patients had already been classified according to recent consensus definitions regarding the clinical course of MS into relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary progressive (SP) or primary progressive (PP). Significant (p < 0.01; Spearman test) differences were present between RR and SP patients regarding total lesion load, size and location of lesions. RR and PP patients showed similar MR patterns. PP and SP patients differed in total lesion load, small and medium-sized lesions. The degree of atrophy was highest for SP patients. The clinical progression rate [Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)/disease duration] was similar for various subgroups; the MR progression rate (total lesion score/disease duration) was significantly larger for SP than for PP patients. The lesions load disability quotient (total lesion load/EDSS) differed between RR and PP patients and also between SP and PP patients. In SP patients, the total lesion load correlated significantly (Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.52) with EDSS. We conclude that PP patients differ in MR abnormalities from SP patients, that PP and RR patients have similar MR abnormalities and that RR and SP patients are at a different end of the same spectrum of the disease. As the dynamics and clinical impact of MS lesions are different in the various clinical subgroups, they should be considered separately in clinical trials.},

The bolus was injected through an intravenous catheter, which was advanced to the central venous position (preferably the right atrium). To investigate myocardial input function, different bolus concentrations and catheter positions were compared. It is concluded that first-pass MR imaging is feasible in human subjects when a central injection of 0.03 mmol/kg of Gd-DTPA is applied. MTT values were similar throughout the myocardium of normal subjects at rest, reflecting normal perfusion. Absolute values of MTT were related to the myocardial input.},

Seven cerebral surface areas were defined, and the development of gyri and sulci in each area was assigned a score between 1 and 5. The postconceptional age (PCA) range of the newborns was 30-42 weeks. When the gyral development scores were assessed as a function of PCA, four transition points could be discerned for the brain as a whole; these transitions occurred at PCAs of 32, 34, 37, and 40 1/2-41 weeks. These four transition points allowed the general gyral development to be divided into five stages. Development of gyri and sulci was most advanced in the area of the central sulcus and the medical occipital area. Development was latest in the frontobasal and frontopolar areas and the anterior part of the temporal lobe. A simple staging system allows easy assessment of the progress of cerebral gyration and sulcation in preterm and term infants.},

Signs and symptoms at presentation were associated with either a positive or negative MR imaging outcome.

Trigeminal neuralgia was correlated with a negative MR imaging outcome (P < .001). Numbness (P < .01), impaired sensation (P < .001), other neurologic symptoms and signs (P < .01), progression of symptoms and signs (P < .001), and duration of symptoms of less than 1 year (P < .001) corresponded to a positive MR imaging outcome. Two regression models, each with three clinical parameters (progression, duration < 1 year, and trigeminal neuralgia or impaired sensation), had comparable accuracy for prediction of the MR imaging outcome. Clinical findings can be used to identify groups in which a high or a low yield of MR imaging is correlated with symptoms and signs related to the trigeminal nerve.},

A single-center retrospective study was performed. Patients who underwent LRYGBP were divided in 3 groups: group A closure of the defects with monofilament Polypropylene suture (Prolene®), group B with braided polyester suture (Ethibond®), group C with barbed knotless Polybutester suture (V-Loc®). Descriptive statistics were performed regarding SBO due to IH/adhesions, adhesion formation, and reopening of closed defects. From 5145 patients, 224 patients underwent exploratory laparoscopy for suspicion of SBO. Mean time interval was 28.4 months. IH or intermittent IH was found in 1.94% in group A, 1.78% in group B, and 1.40% in group C. Obstruction due to adhesions was found in 0.70%, 0.36%, and 0.42% per group, respectively. Adhesions in general were observed in 1.47% in group A, 1.43% in group B, and 1.06% in group C. The incidence of reopening was higher in group A (2.24%) in comparison with group B (1.13%, P = 0.041) and group C (1.05%, P = 0.001). After descriptive analysis, these results can withhold no difference among the 3 non-absorbable sutures regarding incidence of SBO due to IH or SBO due to adhesions, yet tendency for higher reopening rates after closure with monofilament Polypropylene suture is observed.},

Diagnosis of this course by conventional x-ray coronary angiography alone may be equivocal. We postulated that with fast magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, accurate detection of anomalous coronary arteries and unambiguous delineation of their proximal course is feasible. In a selected group of 38 patients, 19 of them having an anomalously originating coronary artery, a fast MR angiographic technique was used to study the proximal coronary anatomy. Blinded analysis of randomly ordered MR studies was performed independently by two observers. Both origin and proximal course of the coronary arteries were defined. Two cardiologists reviewed all x-ray coronary angiograms. After the separate analyses, a final consensus result was defined for each patient. In 37 patients, successful MR coronary angiography could be performed. Interobserver agreement for determining both origin and proximal course was 100%. An x-ray coronary angiogram was available in 36 patients. In 3 patients (all with an anomalous left main coronary artery originating from the right aortic sinus), there was disagreement about the proximal course between the results of MR and x-ray coronary angiography. Review of these cases demonstrated that MR angiography had unambiguously visualized the proximal coronary artery course, whereas the results of x-ray angiography had been equivocal. Thus, sensitivity and specificity for detecting anomalous coronary arteries and delineating their proximal course were 100%. These data suggest that fast MR angiography is highly accurate in determining the origin and delineating the proximal course of anomalous coronary arteries, even in those cases in which x-ray coronary angiographic diagnosis is difficult or even erroneous.},

Four patients had a tethered spinal cord, in 1 in combination with a wedge-shaped cord terminus. The pathogenesis of the caudal regression syndrome can be divided into two kinds: there is usually a disturbance of the primary neurulation process; in other cases there is a derailment of the process of degeneration and differentiation of an initially normally developed primary and secondary neural tube.

We postulated that fast magnetic resonance angiography is capable of (1) imaging proximal coronary arteries, and (2) detecting stenoses of > or = 50% of their luminal diameter. Thirty-five patients, referred for analysis of angina pectoris, underwent both conventional angiography and magnetic resonance angiography of coronary arteries. A fast k-space segmented gradient-echo technique was used during breath-holds. Two observers, blinded to the results of conventional angiography, independently analysed the magnetic resonance studies for (1) length of visualized segments, and (2) presence of signal voids indicative of stenoses. From 140 proximal arteries, 15 (11%) were excluded because of incomplete imaging or degraded image quality. Mean length of the visualized segments was 9 +/- 4 mm for the left main, 62 +/- 16 mm for the left anterior descending, 21 +/- 9 mm for the left circumflex and 89 +/- 32 mm for the right coronary artery. Sensitivity for detecting > or = 50% luminal diameter stenoses was 0.00 for the left circumflex, 0.53 for the left anterior descending coronary artery, 0.71 for the RCA and 1.00 for the left main artery. Specificity varied from 0.73 for the left anterior descending coronary artery to 0.96 for the left circumflex. Inter-observer agreement was 0.90. Thus, segmented magnetic resonance angiography is capable of non-invasive imaging of proximal coronary anatomy. Its good accuracy in detecting left main coronary artery disease, intermediate accuracy in detecting right coronary artery and left anterior descending coronary artery stenoses, and low accuracy in detecting left circumflex lesions fit within a range of sensitivities and specificities found by others. Further technical advances are necessary to make the technique clinically robust.},

Exploratory studies evaluating the impact of COVID-19 infection on the plasma metabolome have been performed, often with small numbers of patients, and with or without relevant control data; however, determining the impact of biological and clinical variables remains critical to understanding potential markers of disease severity and progression. The present large study, including relevant controls, sought to understand independent and overlapping metabolic features of samples from acutely ill patients (n = 831), testing positive (n = 543) or negative (n = 288) for COVID-19. High-throughput metabolomics analyses were complemented with antigen and enzymatic activity assays on 831 plasma samples from acutely ill patients while in the emergency department, at admission, and during hospitalization. We then performed additional lipidomics analyses of the 60 subjects with the lowest and highest body mass index, either COVID-19 positive or negative. Omics data were correlated to detailed data on patient characteristics and clinical laboratory assays measuring coagulation, hematology and chemistry analytes. Significant changes in arginine/proline/citrulline, tryptophan/indole/kynurenine, fatty acid and acyl-carnitine metabolism emerged as highly relevant markers of disease severity, progression and prognosis as a function of biological and clinical variables in these patients. Further, machine learning models were trained by entering all metabolomics and clinical data from half of the COVID-19 patient cohort and then tested on the other half yielding ~ 78% prediction accuracy. Finally, the extensive amount of information accumulated in this large, prospective, observational study provides a foundation for follow-up mechanistic studies and data sharing opportunities, which will advance our understanding of the characteristics of the plasma metabolism in COVID-19 and other acute critical illnesses.},

On the basis of these results, a standardized 2D MRA protocol for the proximal coronary arteries was proposed. Pitfalls in interpretation of coronary MRA images were discussed.},

Computed tomography scans taken immediately postoperatively and 1 year postoperatively of 42 unilateral and of 8 bilateral cleft lip and palate patients who underwent surgery at the age of 9 years (early secondary bone graft) or 12 years (late secondary bone graft) were compared. Three slices from the computed tomography scans taken immediately after the surgery were selected from the center of the bone graft and were then compared with corresponding slices from the 1-year postoperative computed tomography scans. Statistical analysis was performed by using the Wilcoxon 2-sample rank sum test. In the unilateral cleft group, 70% of the transplanted bone remained in the cleft area after 1 year, whereas in the bilateral cleft group, only 45% of the initial bone graft remained after 1 year. No statistically significant difference was found between early secondary bone grafting and late secondary bone grafting. In most cases, a sufficient amount of bone was present in the target area to facilitate eruption of the permanent canine.},

  abstract = {A number of functional brain imaging studies indicate that the medial temporal lobe system is crucially involved in encoding new information into memory. However, most studies were based on differences in brain activity between encoding of familiar vs. novel stimuli. To further study the underlying cognitive processes, we applied a parametric design of encoding. Seven healthy subjects were instructed to encode complex color pictures into memory. Stimuli were presented in a parametric fashion at different rates, thus representing different loads of encoding. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess changes in brain activation. To determine the number of pictures successfully stored into memory, recognition scores were determined afterwards. During encoding, brain activation occurred in the medial temporal lobe, comparable to the results obtained by others. Increasing the encoding load resulted in an increase in the number of successfully stored items. This was reflected in a significant increase in brain activation in the left lingual gyrus, in the left and right parahippocampal gyrus, and in the right inferior frontal gyrus. This study shows that fMRI can detect changes in brain activation during variation of one aspect of higher cognitive tasks. Further, it strongly supports the notion that the human medial temporal lobe is involved in encoding novel visual information into memory.},

The management of these rare and complex injuries can be challenging from initial presentation through definitive management. Timely diagnosis of these injuries is critical to prevent devastating complications, yet the diagnosis is often delayed. Delays in surgery and poor fracture reduction are associated with a high risk of complications such as avascular necrosis. Additionally, these injuries have the potential to be irreducible. This may occur secondary to osteochondral humeral defects, soft tissue interposition, or entrapment. The long head of the biceps tendon incarceration is one potential block to reduction. Definitive surgical treatment options include open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and shoulder arthroplasty. While reoperation rates are higher in patients undergoing ORIF, arthroplasty longevity is a concern among young, active patients with high functional demands. Fibular strut allograft is a useful adjunct when reconstructing complex proximal humerus fractures. We present a case of a 28-year-old male who sustained a significantly comminuted four-part left proximal humerus fracture with an irreducible posterior humeral head dislocation requiring urgent ORIF following a motor vehicle accident.},

Also the radiological response was related to the clinical response. Six weeks after WBRT follow-up MR was performed in 27 of 49 patients. Of the remaining 22 patients without follow-up MR, 9 had died or deteriorated due to neurologic decline. In four patients (15%) tumor increase was demonstrated by computer-assisted analysis; in the other 23 patients tumor remained stable (15%) or decreased (70%). In 11 of the 27 patients, a second follow-up MR was obtained 26 wk after WBRT demonstrating tumor increase in seven patients (64%). Complete discordance between both assessment methods was noticed in only 4 of 38 MR scans (27 scans 6 wk after WBRT and 11 scans 26 wk after WBRT) with small quantitative changes in tumor volume. In 26 of 38 (68%) observations 6 and 26 wk after WBRT, there was a positive correlation between change in tumor volume and change in the Neurologic Status. Visual estimation analysis seems an appropriate method of routine therapy monitoring in individual patients with brain metastases. The computer-assisted analysis should be considered if precise response monitoring becomes critical.},

In 4 patients with muscle-eye-brain disease, MRI showed cortical dysplasia, but less severe than in WWS. The cerebral white matter either was normal or contained multiple focal abnormalities. Malformations of posterior fossa structures were present. Eight patients, classified as having classic merosin-deficient CMD (MD-CMD), had diffuse cerebral hemispheric white matter abnormalities, no other abnormalities. One patient with MD-CMD had only a few, focal white matter abnormalities. Three CMD patients had occipital agyria, otherwise normal gyration, multifocal or more diffuse cerebral white matter changes, and variable hypoplasia of pons and vermis. Two of the 3 patients had negative muscle merosin staining. The conclusion of the study is that MRI is an important adjunct in the classification of CMD patients. CMD with occipital agyria can be regarded as a newly recognized, separate CMD subtype.},

  abstract = {MR coronary angiography is most often performed using two-dimensional techniques. Although three-dimensional (3D) acquisitions do have important advantages, they take too long for a single breath-hold and are thus susceptible to respiratory motion artifacts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of a unique respiratory-gated 3D MR angiographic technique in identifying the proximal coronary arteries in patients suspected of having coronary artery disease. In addition, we investigated the capability of this technique to detect proximal stenoses. We performed a prospective blinded study in 20 patients who were referred for conventional coronary angiography. A cardiac-gated 3D gradient-echo sequence with fat suppression was used. Retrospective respiratory gating was performed using navigator echoes of the diaphragm position. Using multiplanar reformatting, two independent readers blindly analyzed the data sets for visualization of major coronary arteries, lengths of imaged segments, and detection of significant stenoses (> 50% occlusion of the luminal diameter by conventional angiography). Seventy-seven of 80 (96%) coronary arteries were positively identified. In one patient, an anomalous coronary anatomy was readily identified and confirmed by conventional angiography. The average lengths of the imaged segments of the right, left main, left anterior descending, and left circumflex coronary arteries were 58 +/- 13 mm, 9 +/- 5 mm, 59 +/- 16 mm, and 24 +/- 10 mm, respectively. Overall sensitivity for the detection of stenoses was low (38%), with a specificity of 95%. Interobserver agreement was 0.92, with a kappa value of 0.65. Respiratory-gated 3D MR angiography allows accurate identification of proximal coronary arteries and may be valuable for 3D imaging of coronary anomalies. Further technical improvements are required to enhance the value of the technique in detecting stenoses.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical significance of periventricular signal intensity changes on MRI and to compare the predictive value of neonatal MRI with that of ultrasound. The infants underwent repeated standardised motor assessments and developmental tests. MRI was repeated at the corrected age of 12 months. Pronounced periventricular signal intensity changes on neonatal MRI and periventricular echodensities (flaring) on ultrasound were associated with a high incidence of transient motor problems during infancy. The degree of echogenicity carried the highest predictive value, as compared to duration of flaring on ultrasound and degree of periventricular signal intensity change on MRI. It is concluded that signal intensity changes on neonatal MRI represent the same ischaemic change of the periventricular white matter as flaring on ultrasound and that routine neonatal MRI screening is not warranted in premature infants without clinical evidence of neurological problems and with normal or mildly abnormal ultrasound scans. Recording of the degree of echogenicity should become a routine procedure in neonatal cerebral ultrasonography.},

Our purpose was to investigate the possibility of diagnosing PVL in the acute stage by using MR imaging. We evaluated early MR features of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in neonates with periventricular densities (flares) on cranial sonograms to determine the added value of MR imaging over sonography alone for early diagnosis of brain damage. In a prospective study, infants who showed flares and/or cysts on sonograms underwent MR imaging during the (sub)acute stage. Fifty infants were classified according to the highest sonographic grade up to the day of MR imaging: 23 infants had sonographic grade 1 (flares < 1 week), 15 had sonographic grade 2 (flares > or = 1 week), four had sonographic grade 3 (small localized cysts), and eight had sonographic grade 4 (extensive periventricular cysts); none had sonographic grade 5 (multicystic leukomalacia) on the day of MR imaging. Overall, the additional information provided by MR imaging (over sonography alone) consisted of the depiction of hemorrhagic lesions in 64% of the infants. Extent and severity of the hemorrhages varied from isolated punctate lesions to extensive hemorrhages throughout the white matter; the latter were followed by cystic degeneration at autopsy in two infants. In nine of the 12 infants with cystic PVL, MR images showed more numerous or more extensive cysts. In addition, in two infants, MR images showed cysts not present on sonograms. In 32% of the infants, MR imaging provided no additional information; in these children, all but one had flares on sonograms whereas MR images showed no abnormalities or a zone of mild periventricular signal change. MR imaging can depict the precise site and extent of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury at an earlier stage and allows a wider differentiation of lesions as compared with sonography alone. Hemorrhagic PVL is considered to be rare, but was present in 64% of our study population.},

No basic biochemical defect could be identified. Brain biopsy was performed in one of the patients and the histopathological findings are described in the present report. A spongiform leukoencephalopathy was revealed, without cortical involvement. Most vacuoles were covered by single five-layered membranes, representing single myelin lamellae. Some vacuoles were partially covered by multi-lamellar myelin sheaths or oligodendroglial cell extensions. The vacuoles were never found in the middle or inner parts of myelin sheaths, but involved the outermost lamellae of myelin sheaths only, whereas the remainder of the myelin sheaths remained undisturbed. The histopathological findings place the disease among the vacuolating myelinopathies, although it is distinct from the well-known forms. Possible pathophysiological mechanisms are splitting of the outermost myelin lamellae at the intraperiod line or a disturbance of compaction of the outermost myelin lamellae at the intraperiod line.},

Seventy-four patients with clinically isolated neurological symptoms suggestive of multiple sclerosis were studied with MRI.

Clinically definite multiple sclerosis developed in 33 patients (prevalence 45%). The optimum cut-off point (number of lesions) was one for most MRI criteria (including gadolinium-enhancement and juxta-cortical lesions), but three for periventricular lesions, and nine for the total number of T2-lesions. Only gadolinium-enhancement and juxta-cortical lesions provided independent information. A final model which, in addition, included infratentorial and periventricular lesions, had an accuracy of 80%, and having more abnormal criteria, predicted conversion to clinically definite multiple sclerosis strongly. The model performed better than the criteria of Paty et al. (Neurology 1988; 38: 180-5) and of Fazekas et al. (Neurology 1988; 38: 1822-5).

In two patients, both clinically normal, MR images showed a diffuse mild abnormality in signal intensity of the cerebral white matter, with multiple foci of more pronounced signal abnormality superimposed. In the third patient, who was clinically retarded and had a cerebral visual impairment, MR imaging showed, in addition to a diffuse signal abnormality of the cerebral white matter, atrophic scarring of the occipital lobes and abnormal signal intensity of the thalami and basal ganglia. It is highly probable that the additional lesions in the occipital lobes and basal nuclei were related to the episode of severe neonatal hypoglycemia the patient experienced. The MR spectroscopic abnormalities correlated with the degree of disease as evidenced by MR imaging.},

In pilot experiments, using fMRI with photic stimulation, we found differences between activated areas when the left or the right eye was stimulated separately. In this study we investigated whether this could be explained by ocular dominance. We studied 26 healthy volunteers (mean age 23.3 +/- 3.5 years). Ocular dominance was determined by means of the near-far alignment test. fMRI-measurements consisted of a double-slice gradient echo sequence. Slices were acquired placed parallel on either side of the calcarine fissure. Visual stimulation was done with goggles with two LED matrices (red light, 8 Hz); each in front of one eye. In each subject, the left and right eye were stimulated separately and together, in a randomly alternating order. Twenty-two subjects showed activation, of whom eight subjects had a dominant left eye and 14 a dominant right eye. In general the size of the activated area was bigger upon stimulation of the dominant eye. The difference with the area upon stimulation of the non-dominant eye was statistically significant in the right eye dominant group. These results indicate that the dominant eye actually activates a larger area of the primary visual cortex than the non-dominant eye. This provides for the first time a functional basis for the concept of ocular dominance.},

A retrospective analysis was done of the records of all consecutive patients (N = 147) with rectal carcinoma Dukes' Stage B or C who have received postoperative local radiotherapy in our institution in the years 1981 through 1989. All patients have been treated on a limited target area covered by only local radiation fields. Locoregional fields covering the whole iliac node chains have not been given. In our treatment protocol doses per fraction were from 2.25 to 2.50 Gy and total doses from 50 to 55 Gy. The minimum follow-up was 24 months; eight patients have been lost to follow-up. The overall 5-year survival rate for the whole group of patients was 39%. The actuarial 2- and 5-year pelvic recurrence rates were 14% and 22% respectively for Dukes' B patients and 30% and 38% respectively for Dukes' C patients. The difference between the pelvic recurrence rates of Stage B and Stage C patients was statistically significant (p = 0.009). No other factors with prognostic significance for pelvic recurrence were found. The interval between surgery and radiotherapy especially had no influence on pelvic recurrence rates. The 35 pelvic recurrences were classified as follows: 17 in-field, 5 marginal, 1 out-of-field, and 9 peritoneal seeding; in three patients there was not enough information for classification. Of the 32 classified pelvic recurrences, the five marginal recurrences were probably geographical misses, only the one out-of-field recurrences, the five marginal recurrences were probably geographical misses; only the one out-of-field recurrence might have been prevented with locoregional radiotherapy. Serious complications caused by the radiotherapy have occurred in 3% of the patients. We conclude that the results of postoperative local radiotherapy alone are comparable with the published results of locoregional radiation. Even when relatively high doses per fraction are given low complication rates are seen.},

This study aims to generate insight into the heterogeneity in implementation fidelity trajectories of a health promotion program in multidisciplinary settings and the relationship with changes in patients' health behavior. This study used longitudinal data from the nationwide implementation of an evidence-informed physical activity promotion program in Dutch rehabilitation care. Fidelity scores were calculated based on annual surveys filled in by involved professionals (n = ± 70). Higher fidelity scores indicate a more complete implementation of the program's core components. A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on the implementation fidelity scores of 17 organizations at three different time points. Quantitative and qualitative data were used to explore organizational and professional differences between identified trajectories. Regression analyses were conducted to determine differences in patient outcomes. Three trajectories were identified as the following: 'stable high fidelity' (n = 9), 'moderate and improving fidelity' (n = 6), and 'unstable fidelity' (n = 2). The stable high fidelity organizations were generally smaller, started earlier, and implemented the program in a more structured way compared to moderate and improving fidelity organizations. At the implementation period's start and end, support from physicians and physiotherapists, professionals' appreciation, and program compatibility were rated more positively by professionals working in stable high fidelity organizations as compared to the moderate and improving fidelity organizations (p < .05). Qualitative data showed that the stable high fidelity organizations had often an explicit vision and strategy about the implementation of the program. Intriguingly, the trajectories were not associated with patients' self-reported physical activity outcomes (adjusted model β = - 651.6, t(613) = - 1032, p = .303). Differences in organizational-level implementation fidelity trajectories did not result in outcome differences at patient-level. This suggests that an effective implementation fidelity trajectory is contingent on the local organization's conditions. More specifically, achieving stable high implementation fidelity required the management of tensions: realizing a localized change vision, while safeguarding the program's standardized core components and engaging the scarce physicians throughout the process. When scaling up evidence-informed health promotion programs, we propose to tailor the management of implementation tensions to local organizations' starting position, size, and circumstances.

State Space Grids (SSGs) is a dynamic system method that can be used to study counsellor-client interactions by examining frequencies, durations and sequences of BCT delivery and receipt. In this methods paper, we show how SSG methods can be pragmatically used to characterize counsellor-client interactions during a PA behavioural support intervention for adults with disabilities. Methods were demonstrated through a secondary analysis of data from adults with spinal cord injury (age: 45.79 ± 13.63; females: n = 5; males: n = 9) who received PA counselling. Transcripts of 30 audio-recorded counselling sessions (total duration: ∼8.3 h) were double-coded for BCT delivery and receipt statements using a reliable coding method (>84% agreement) and analyzed in two different ways using SSGs methods. Applying the SSG analyses to our data demonstrated that frequencies, durations, and sequences of BCT delivery and receipt varied largely within and between dyads. Across all sessions, the counsellor and client spent on average 32-34% of their time on talking about BCTs related to goals and planning, ∼29% of their time talking about other BCTs (e.g., self-belief, support strategies), and the remaining 27-29% of their time talking about other topics (not BCT-specific). This paper showed how dynamic system methods can be pragmatically used to characterize counsellor-client interactions and illustrate the variability of how BCTs are delivered by a counsellor and received by clients in a PA behavioural support intervention. We demonstrated that SSGs methods can facilitate the examination of frequencies, durations and sequences of BCT delivery and receipt can help advance our understanding of PA behavioural support for adults with and without disabilities.},

Underpinned by a pragmatic perspective, ten semi-structured timeline interviews were conducted with researchers and RU who have experiences with SCI research partnerships. Interviews focused on experiences in participants' lives that have led them to become a person who conducts and/or disseminates research in partnership. Data were analysed using narrative thematic analysis. We identified three threads from participants' stories: (1) seeing and valuing different perspectives, (2) inspirational role models, and (3) relational and personal aspect of research partnerships. We identified sub-threads related to experiences that participants draw on how they came to be a person who engage in (health) research partnerships, and sub-threads related to participants' reasons for engaging in research partnerships. While most sub-threads were identified from both researchers' and RU' perspectives (eg, partnership successes and failures), some were unique for researchers (morally the right thing to do) or RU (advocating). Using a narrative and pragmatic approach, this study provided a new understanding of SCI researchers' and RU' partnership experiences over time.

This study was conducted on a 940-cow spring-calving herd in New Zealand's North Island between May 2018 and May 2019. Cows (n = 250) were randomly allocated to the hoof trimming group, with the remainder assigned to the non-trim cohort. One trained professional hoof trimmer used the five-step Dutch method to trim the hind feet of the trimming group. Throughout the subsequent production season, the whole herd was locomotion-scored fortnightly using the 4-point (0-3) Dairy NZ lameness score. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to assess the univariable effect of trimming on the interval between calving and first LS of ≥ 2 and first LS ≥ 1. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to further evaluate the effect of trimming on time to elevated LS. Mean lameness (LS ≥ 2) prevalence was 2.6%, with 30% of cows having ≥ 4 observations during the study period when at least one LS was ≥ 2. For LS ≥ 1, mean prevalence was 40%, with 98.6% of cows having ≥ 4 observations during the study period when at least one LS was ≥ 1 during lactation. Hoof trimming had no apparent effect on the incidence of clinical lameness (LS ≥ 2) (trimmed  On this farm, prophylactic hoof trimming had no clinically relevant impact on the incidence of clinical lameness and was not associated with clinically beneficial reductions in time to first observed LS ≥ 2. This may be because claw horn imbalance was not pronounced on this farm, with 53% of cows needing no trim on either hind limb on the first trimming occasion. Further research on the response to prophylactic trimming in pasture-based dairy cattle is required.},

Seventy-one rehabilitation professionals filled out a questionnaire on how sports and physical activity, including stimulation activities, were implemented into rehabilitation care. Total fidelity scores (in %) were calculated for each organization. Professionals' satisfaction was rated on a scale from 1 to 10. In most organizations sports and physical activity were to some extent integrated during and after rehabilitation (fidelity scores: median = 54%, IQR = 23%). Physical activity stimulation was not always embedded as standard component of a rehabilitation treatment. Professionals' satisfaction rated a median value of 8.0 (IQR = 0.0) indicating high satisfaction rates.

As IKT trainees (i.e. graduate students, postdoctoral scholars) within the Integrated Knowledge Translation Research Network (IKTRN), we experienced several changes and adaptations to our daily routine, work and research environments due to the rapid transition to virtual platforms. While there was an increased capacity to communicate at local, national and international levels, gaps in equitable access to training and partnership opportunities at universities and organizations have emerged. This essay explores the experiences and reflections of 16 IKTRN trainees during the first 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic at the micro (individual), meso (organizational) and macro (system) levels. The micro level, or individual experiences, focuses on topics of self-care (taking care of oneself for physical and mental well-being), maintaining research activities and productivity, and leisure (social engagement and taking time for oneself), while conducting IKT research during the pandemic. At the meso level, the role of programmes and organizations explores whether and how institutions were able to adapt and continue research and/or partnerships during the pandemic. At the macro level, we discuss implications for policies to support IKT trainees and research, during and beyond emergency situations. Themes were identified that intersected across all levels, which included (i) equitable access to training and partnerships; (ii) capacity for reflexivity; (iii) embracing changing opportunities; and (iv) strengthening collaborative relationships. These intersecting themes represent ways of encouraging sustainable and equitable improvements towards establishing and maintaining collaborative health research approaches. This essay is a summary of our collective experiences and aims to provide suggestions on how organizations and universities can support future trainees conducting collaborative research.

To explore this hypothesis, we studied the clinical, radiological and intraoperative findings of 18 patients, and related these findings to the histopathological characteristics of the tumor. No differences were found between dermoid and epidermoid tumors regarding clinical presentation, radiological examination and outcome, while intraoperative diagnosis by the surgeon correlated with the histopathological diagnosis in only 8 of 18 cases. Therefore, the histopathological difference between intraspinal dermoid and epidermoid tumors is not important in clinical practice and should be avoided.

  abstract = {Validated questionnaires can support the identification of psychosocial problems by the Preventive Child Health Care (PCH) system. This study assesses the validity and added value of four scoring methods used with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for the identification of psychosocial problems among children aged 7-12 by the PCH. We included 711 (of 814) children (response: 87%) aged 7-12 undergoing routine health assessments in nine PCH services across the Netherlands. Child health professionals interviewed and examined children and parents. Prior to the interview, parents completed the SDQ and the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), which were not shown to the professionals. The CBCL and data about the child's current treatment status were used as criteria for the validity of the SDQ. We used four SDQ scoring approaches: an elevated SDQ Total Difficulties Score (TDS), parent-defined difficulties, an elevated score for emotional symptoms, conduct problems or hyperactivity in combination with a high impairment score, and a combined score: an elevated score for any of these three methods. The Cohen's Kappa ranged from 0.33 to 0.64 for the four scoring methods with the CBCL scores and treatment status, generally indicating a moderate to good agreement. All four methods added significantly to the identification of problems by the PCH. Classification based on the TDS yielded results similar to more complicated methods. The SDQ is a valid tool for the identification of psychosocial problems by PCH. As a first step, the use of a simple classification based on the SDQ TDS is recommended.},

  abstract = {Schools are overloaded with health promotion programs that, altogether, focus on a broad array of behavioral domains, including substance abuse, sexuality and nutrition. Although the specific content of programs varies according to the domain focus, programs usually address similar concepts: knowledge, attitudinal beliefs, social influences and skills. This apparent conceptual overlap between behaviors and programs provides opportunities for a transfer-oriented approach which will stimulate students to apply the knowledge and skills they have learned in one domain (e.g. skills for resisting tobacco use) to other domains (e.g. alcohol, sex). A requirement for such an approach is that behaviors share at least some determinants. This review addresses this issue by examining similarities between domain-specific determinants of smoking, drinking, safe sex and healthy nutrition among adolescents. Recent empirical studies and reviews were examined. The results show that the following determinants are relevant to all four behaviors: beliefs about immediate gratification and social advantages, peer norms, peer and parental modeling and refusal self-efficacy. Several other determinants have been found to relate to at least two behaviors, e.g. health risk beliefs and parental norms. These results can be used for the development of a transfer-oriented school health promotion curriculum.},

CABG is recommended in patients with ULMCA stenosis according to the AHA/ACC and ESC guidelines, and there are limited data on the long-term outcomes in patients selected by the local Heart Team to undergo PCI. Between 1996 and 2007, 227 patients underwent PCI for ULMCA stenosis based on decision of the local Heart Team and patient's and/or physician's preference. All patients were contacted at 1 year and in November 2008. Long-term follow-up was up to 8 years with a mean of 3.9 +/- 2.6 years. Overall, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target lesion revascularization (TLR) was 14.8% at 1 year, 18.3% at 3 years, and 20.9% at 5 years with no events occurring thereafter. Patients considered at low surgical risk for CABG had a significantly lower incidence of cardiac death or MI compared to patients considered at high surgical risk at 8 years (1.4 vs. 16.8%; 1.4 vs. 14.8%, respectively); however, no significant difference was observed for cardiac death, MI, or TLR (18.6 vs. 24.4%). PCI of ULMCA stenosis in patients selected by the Heart Team resulted in good long-term clinical outcomes with most events occurring within the 1st year. Patients considered at low surgical risk for CABG have a significantly better long-term survival than patients at high risk for surgery.},

We described and compared perceived effects of involving knowledge users in the project, team cohesion, capability, opportunity and motivation for working in partnership between two categories of respondents: project role [nominated principal investigators (NPIs), other researchers and knowledge users] and gender. We analysed data from 589 respondents (42% NPIs, 40% other researchers and 18% knowledge users; 56% women). Among the perceived effects variables, the proportion of ratings of significant influence of involving knowledge users in the project ranged between 12% and 63%. Cohesion, capability, opportunity and motivation variables ranged between 58% and 97% agreement. There were no significant differences between respondent groups for most variables. NPIs and women rated the overall influence of involving knowledge users as significant more than other respondent groups (p < 0.001). NPIs also reported higher agreement with feeling sufficiently included in team activities, pressure to engage and partnerships enabling personal goals (all p < 0.001). Most respondents held positive perceptions of working in partnership, although ratings of perceived effects indicated limited effects of involving knowledge users in specific research components and on project outcomes. Continued analysis of project outcomes may identify specific contexts and partnership characteristics associated with greater impact.},

This study aimed to apply behavior change theory to understand and support researchers' adoption of a research partnership approach and the Integrated Knowledge Translation (IKT) Guiding Principles for conducting and disseminating spinal cord injury (SCI) research in partnership. Using an IKT approach, SCI researchers across Canada and the USA completed a survey (n = 22) and were interviewed (n = 13) to discuss barriers and facilitators to deciding to partner and follow the IKT Guiding Principles. The Behaviour Change Wheel, Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), and Mode of Delivery Ontology were used to develop the survey, interview questions, and guided analyses of interview data. COM-B and TDF factors were examined using descriptive statistics and abductive analyses of barriers and facilitators of decisions to partner and/or use the IKT Guiding Principles. TDF domains from the interview transcripts were then used to identify intervention, content, and implementation options. 142 factors (79 barriers, 63 facilitators) related to deciding to partner, and 292 factors (187 barriers, 105 facilitators) related to deciding to follow the IKT Guiding Principles were identified. Barriers to partnering or use the IKT Guiding Principles were primarily related to capability and opportunity and relevant intervention options were recommended. Interventions must support researchers in understanding how to partner and use the IKT Guiding Principles while navigating a research system, which is not always supportive of the necessary time and costs required for meaningful research partnerships.},

One fresh leaflet and a cryopreserved leaflet derived from the same valve were cut into 2 mm diameter pieces and incubated with responder peripheral blood mononuclear cells, matched or mismatched for HLA-DR. The tritiated thymidine incorporation into the lymphocytes measured after 7 days, was expressed as stimulation index. Fresh, HLA-mismatched valve pieces induced high stimulation index in all cases (median 9, range 4 to 117). The cryopreservation procedure resulted in a significantly lower stimulation index (p = 0.002, Wilcoxon), with a median stimulation index of 2 (range 0 to 9). In the instances where HLA-DR matched combinations were studied, cryopreservation was also associated with lower stimulation index. HLA matching itself was able to reduce the stimulation index both with cryopreserved and fresh valve pieces as stimulator, resulting in a median stimulation index of 4 (range 2 to 117) for the HLA-DR-mismatched and 1 (range 0 to 5) for the matched lymphocytes (p = 0.006, Wilcoxon). In conclusion, human cardiac valves are able to stimulate immune competent cells in vitro, even after cryopreservation. The cellular allogeneic response in vitro could be an explanation for valve allograft degeneration observed in the clinic. Matching for HLA-DR may reduce these effects.},

Monitoring physical activity levels is important to provide insight on how much and what types of activities people with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases engage in. This information can be used as input for interventions to promote a physically active lifestyle. Therefore, valid and reliable physical activity measurement instruments are needed. This scoping review aims 1) to provide a critical mapping of the existing literature and 2) directions for future research on measurement properties of device-based instruments assessing physical activity behavior in ambulant adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. Four databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Embase) were systematically searched from 2015 to April 16 One hundred three of 21566 Studies were included. 55 Consumer-grade and 23 research-grade devices were studied on measurement properties, using 14 different physical activity outcomes, in 23 different physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. ActiGraph (n = 28) and Fitbit (n = 39) devices were most frequently studied. Steps (n = 68) was the most common used physical activity outcome. 97 studies determined validity, 11 studies reliability and 6 studies responsiveness. This scoping review shows a large variability in research on measurement properties of device-based instruments in ambulatory adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases. The variability highlights a need for standardization of and consensus on research in this field. The review provides directions for future research.},

Recommendations and tools exist to aid implementation groups in selecting TMFs, but they do not explicitly outline a systematic method for identifying and selecting TMFs. This paper aimed to (1) propose a systematic consensus-based method to select TMFs to support implementation processes, and to (2) demonstrate the use of this novel method in the context of researching the implementation of hip protectors for fracture prevention in long-term care (LTC). We developed a systematic, consensus-based method for selecting TMFs, referred to as the Implementation Theory Selection Model (ITSM). The ITSM comprises five steps: (1) identify potentially relevant TMFs; (2) narrow the pool of TMFs; (3) appraise the relevance of eligible TMFs; (4) prioritize a short-list of TMFs for further, in-depth consideration; and (5) select TMFs through consensus with investigators and research user partners. We operationalized each step of the ITSM through a project investigating determinants of hip protector use and organizational readiness for implementation in a LTC organization in Ontario, Canada. Using the ITSM in our case example, we identified 66 TMFs (Step 1). Of these, 23 met our eligibility criteria (Step 2) and were appraised twice, by five appraisers (Step 3). Six TMFs (Step 4) advanced to the consensus meeting, which was attended by nine investigators and three research users, including two organizational partners and one older adult. Three rounds of voting yielded a tie between the TMFs the group felt would be most appropriate. Research users from our partner LTC organization made the final selection preferring the combination of the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (Step 5). The ITSM offers a step-by-step guide for implementation groups to adopt a rigorous, transparent and reproducible method for TMF selection. Although we have demonstrated the feasibility of operationalizing each step of the ITSM in our case example, continued research is needed to evaluate and refine the ITSM to ensure it is appropriate for a wide variety of implementation contexts.},

Calcification occurs in almost all transplanted valves, and in children acute valve failure is frequently seen. We hypothesized that failure of the human valve allografts could have an immunologic basis. This hypothesis was tested in a functional way by performing lymphocyte stimulation assays using fresh and cryopreserved valve pieces and endothelial cells derived from valve leaflets as stimulator. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes, both matched and mismatched for HLA antigens, were used as responder cells. The results were expressed as the stimulation index. Fresh valve pieces induced a significantly higher stimulation index (median, 9; range, 4 to 117) compared with the cryopreserved pieces (median, 2; range, 0 to 9; p = 0.002 by Wilcoxon test). The stimulation index was significantly reduced when lymphocytes matched for HLA-DR with the valve pieces were used (median, 1; range, 0 to 5) as compared with the HLA-DR-mismatched combination (median, 4; range, 2 to 117; p = 0.006, Wilcoxon test). Valve leaflet-derived endothelial cells were able to induce a median stimulation index of 8 (range, 3 to 15) when incubated with lymphocytes mismatched for HLA-A, -B, and -DR. In conclusion, stimulation of immune-competent cells in vitro is induced by both fresh and cryopreserved human valve pieces and by endothelial cells derived from fresh valve leaflets. The immune response can be reduced by using cryopreserved valves or by matching valve donor and responder lymphocytes for HLA-DR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Preventive Child Healthcare professionals assessed children's psychosocial functioning during routine health examinations. We assessed the scale structure (by means of Structural Equation Modelling), validity (correlation coefficients, sensitivity and specificity) and usability (ratings by parents and professionals) of each questionnaire and the degree to which they could improve the identification based only on clinical assessment (logistic regression). For the three questionnaires, Cronbach's alphas varied between 0.80 and 0.89. Sensitivities for a clinical CBCL at a cut off point with specificity = 0.90 varied between 0.78 and 0.86 for the three questionnaires. Areas under the Receiver Operating Curve, using the CBCL as criterion, varied between 0.93 and 0.96. No differences were statistically significant. All three questionnaires added information to the clinical assessment. Odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for added information were PSC: 29.3 (14.4-59.8), SDQ: 55.0 (23.1-131.2) and PSYBOBA: 68.5 (28.3-165.6). Parents preferred the SDQ and PSYBOBA. Preventive Child Health Care professionals preferred the SDQ. This randomized comparison of three questionnaires shows that each of the three questionnaires can improve the detection of psychosocial dysfunction among children substantially.},

The area under the ROC curve using the CBCL as a criterion was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.92 to 0.96). At the US cut-off (28 and above), the prevalence rate of an increased score and sensitivity were lower than in the USA. At a lower cut-off (22 and above), sensitivity and specificity were similar to that of the US version (71.7% and 93.0% respectively). Information on the PSC also helped in the identification of children with elevated CBCL Total Problems Scores, above solely clinical judgment. The PSC is also useful for the early detection of psychosocial problems in preventive child healthcare outside the USA, especially with an adjusted cut-off.},

  abstract = {We studied the presence of donor-specific T lymphocytes in explanted human cardiac valve allografts in vivo. From five of seven explants we propagated lymphocyte cultures in an interleukin-2 conditioned medium. Phenotyping revealed the presence of T-cell receptors in more than 95% of the lymphocytes obtained in each culture. Donor-specific cytotoxicity was demonstrated in three patients with known HLA status of the donor. Cytotoxicity was directed against only HLA class I in one patient, and against class I and/or class II in the others. These results indicate that donor-specific cellular reactivity can be induced by transplantation of human cardiac valve allografts.},

  abstract = {Health, fitness and lifestyle professionals can play important roles in promoting physical activity in groups at risk of developing an inactive lifestyle, such as people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Tailored counselling is a promising tool to promote and improve physical activity levels. To support professionals to effectively have a conversation about physical activity with clients with SCI, evidence-based training and resources are needed. This project aimed to (1) co-develop an e-learning course on best practices for SCI physical activity counselling and, (2) examine the effectiveness and usability of this course. Guided by the technology-enhanced learning (TEL) evaluation framework, we used a systematic, multistep approach to co-develop and evaluate an e-learning course. The development process was informed by input and feedback from a diverse group of end-users and experts (n > 160) via online surveys and (think-aloud) interviews. A randomized controlled trial was used to compare learning outcomes (post-knowledge and self-efficacy) between participants who completed the course (intervention group) and the wait-listed control group. Usability, learning experiences, and satisfaction were assessed among all participants. Forty-one participants (21 intervention-group; 20 control-group) with various backgrounds (e.g., lifestyle counsellors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, recreation therapists, fitness trainers) enrolled in the randomized controlled trial. After completing the course, participants in the intervention group showed significantly improved knowledge on the best practices for SCI physical activity counselling and higher self-efficacy for using these best practices in conversations with clients with SCI compared to the control group (p <.001). Participants reported above average usability scores, positive learning experiences, and high levels of satisfaction when completing the course. We used a systematic, multi-step, theory-informed approach to co-develop and evaluate an evidence-based e-learning course on SCI physical activity counselling to support professionals to promote physical activity in their daily practices. The overall positive findings demonstrate that the e-learning course is feasible and ready for further implementation in various health and community settings. Implementation of the e-learning course can help professionals improve the physical activity support they provide to their clients, and subsequently increase physical activity participation in people with SCI.},

This study explored how activity pacing relates to fatigue and physical activity in people with MS. Participants were 80 individuals (60 females, 20 males) with a diagnosis of MS. The participants filled in questionnaires on their activity pacing, fatigue, physical activity, and health-related quality of life, 3-6 weeks before discharge from rehabilitation. The relationships between the variables were examined using hierarchical regression. After controlling for demographics, health-related quality of life, and perceived risk of overactivity, no associations were found between activity pacing and fatigue (β = 0.20; t = 1.43, },

In this study, we documented and described the processes and outcomes of an IKT approach to diffusing and disseminating the findings of consensus recommendations for conducting spinal cord injury research. Communication of the IKT Guiding Principles in two phases: a diffusion phase during the first 102 days from the manuscript's publication, followed by a 1147 day active dissemination phase. A record of all inputs was kept and all activities were tracked by monitoring partnership communication, a partnership tracking survey, a project curriculum vitae, and team emails. Awareness outcomes were tracked through Google Analytics and a citation-forward search. Awareness includes the website accesses, the number of downloads, and the number of citations in the 29 month period following publication. In the diffusion period, the recommendations were viewed 60 times from 4 different countries, and 4 new downloads. In the dissemination period, the recommendations were viewed 1109 times from 39 different countries, 386 new downloads, and 54 citations. Overall, during dissemination there was a 17.5% increase in new visitors to the website a month and a 95.5% increase in downloads compared to diffusion. This project provides an overview of an IKT approach to diffusion and dissemination. Overall, IKT may be helpful for increasing awareness of research findings faster; however, more research is needed to understand best practices and the the impact of an IKT approach on the diffusion and dissemination versus a non-partnered approach.},

Despite their growing use, a comprehensive understanding of the principles, strategies, outcomes, and impacts of different types of research partnerships is lacking. Generating high-quality evidence in this area is challenging due to the breadth and diversity of relevant literature. We established a Coordinated Multicenter Team approach to identify and synthesize the partnership literature and better understand the evidence base. This review protocol outlines an innovative approach to locating, reviewing, and synthesizing the literature on research partnerships. Five reviews pertaining to research partnerships are proposed. The Coordinated Multicenter Team developed a consensus-driven conceptual framework to guide the reviews. First, a review of reviews will comparatively describe and synthesize key domains (principles, strategies, outcomes, and impacts) for different research partnership approaches, within and beyond health (e.g., integrated knowledge translation, participatory action research). After identifying commonly used search terminology, three complementary scoping reviews will describe and synthesize these domains in the health research partnership literature. Finally, an umbrella review will amalgamate and reflect on the collective findings and identify research gaps and future directions. We will develop a collaborative review methodology, comprising search strategy efficiencies, terminology standardization, and the division of screening, extraction, and synthesis to optimize feasibility and literature capture. A series of synthesis and scoping manuscripts will emerge from this Coordinated Multicenter Team approach. Comprehensively describing and differentiating research partnership terminology and its domains will address well-documented gaps in the literature. These efforts will contribute to and improve the quality, conduct, and reporting of research partnership literature. The collaborative review methodology will help identify and establish common terms, leverage efficiencies (e.g., expertise, experience, search and protocol design, resources) and optimize research feasibility and quality. Our approach allows for enhanced scope and inclusivity of all research user groups and domains, thereby contributing uniquely to the literature. This multicenter, efficiency and quality-focused approach may serve to inspire researchers across the globe in addressing similar domain challenges, as exist in this rapidly expanding field.},

Cows (n=2,695) on three dairy farms in Canterbury, New Zealand, were examined and the height differential between their hind claws on each limb was measured. Cows were blocked by age, then breed and grouped by height differential, before being randomly assigned to either treatment or control groups. Cows in the control group were not trimmed, whilst cows in the treatment group were all trimmed according to the 'Dutch Trimming' method by an experienced foot trimmer. All subsequent clinical incidences of lameness were identified, recorded and classified according to five categories. The overall incidence of lameness, the effect of claw height differential on the incidence of lameness and the effect of trimming on the incidence of lameness were assessed using both GEE modelling and survival analysis. The incidence of lameness identified in any untrimmed hindlimb irrespective of diagnosis, measured at a limb level and assessing the first incidence of lameness only, was 10.0% for a 6-month period from November to drying off. The predominant lesion identified was white line disease (WLD; 7.9% incidence and 78.6% of all lameness). The overall incidence of hindlimb lameness measured at cow level for the same period was 14.5%. The risk of lameness was influenced by breed (p=0.016), age (p=0.002) and claw height differential (p=0.026). There were no significant interactions. The risk of lameness was lowest where the claw height differential was 0-2 mm. The incidence of lameness in the first 70 days following trimming was higher in older cows than in younger cows (p<0.001). Trimming did not affect lameness incidence (p=0.185). The Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that farm (p<0.001), trimming group (p=0.021); and age (p=0.021) significantly affected the median days to lameness in the first 70 days following trimming. Hind feet with lower height differentials between claws had a lower incidence of lameness. Trimming of these feet to remove the height differential did not reduce their overall incidence of lameness, but did increase days to first lameness.},

Community. Aligned with an IKT approach, an SCI organization was meaningfully engaged throughout the research process. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with people with SCI who have quit or tried to quit smoking. Barriers and facilitators to smoking cessation were extracted and deductively coded using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and inductively analysed. To identify intervention options, a behavioural analysis was conducted using the Behaviour Change Wheel. To identify implementation options, modes of delivery and intervention messengers were extracted. Modes of delivery were deductively coded, and themes relating to intervention messengers were constructed. Among the 12 participants (7 males; 6 with tetraplegia), seven had quit and five had relapsed. Across the 12 interviews, 130 barriers and 218 facilitators were coded to the TDF. The prominent TDF domains were beliefs about consequences, social influences, environmental context and resources, and behavioural regulation, and served as themes in the inductive analysis. Multiple modes of delivery and intervention messengers were considered important for the delivery of smoking cessation interventions. This study is the first to use IKT and theory-based approaches to explore factors influencing smoking cessation among persons with SCI. Findings from this study resulted in the co-development of practical recommendations for future SCI-specific smoking cessation interventions.},

The evidence-based programme Rehabilitation, Sports and Exercise (RSE) that aims to stimulate an active lifestyle during and after a rehabilitation period in people with a disability and/or chronic disease is prepared for nationwide dissemination. So far, however, little is known about the implementation of a new programme to stimulate physical activity in people with a disability in a rehabilitation setting. Therefore, a process evaluation of the implementation of the RSE programme within 18 Dutch rehabilitation centres and hospitals is performed in order to gain more insight into the implementation process itself and factors that facilitate or hamper the implementation process. This paper describes the study design of this process evaluation. During a three-year period, the adoption, implementation and continuation of the RSE programme is monitored and evaluated in 12 rehabilitation centres and 6 hospitals with a rehabilitation department in The Netherlands. The main process outcomes are: recruitment, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, satisfaction, maintenance and context. The process outcomes are evaluated at different levels (organisational and patient) and different time points. Data collection includes both quantitative (online registration system and questionnaires) and qualitative (focus groups and semi-structured interviews) methods. The nationwide dissemination of an evidence-based programme to stimulate physical activity and sports during and after a rehabilitation period is extensively monitored and evaluated on different levels (organization and patients) using mixed methods. The study will contribute to the science of translating evidence-based programmes into daily practice of the rehabilitation care. The results of the study can be used to further optimize the content of the RSE programme and to facilitate the implementation in other health facilities. Furthermore, the results of the study can help future implementation processes in the rehabilitation setting. The study is registered by The Netherlands National Trial Register: NTR3961.},

The belief that vaccination is safe and the best way to protect children against infectious diseases positively influenced parents' attitudes. The idea that children receive too many vaccines simultaneously and that vaccination interferes with natural development had a negative effect on attitudes. Dutch parents believe that doctors only inform them about the benefits of vaccination and disregard possible drawbacks. Since attitudes did not appear to be the result of thorough deliberation, parents could easily be influenced by negative publicity about vaccination. Educational campaigns and practitioners' advice should provide complete information about all aspects of the question, enabling parents to make well-considered and therefore enduring decisions.},

This study aimed to identify the principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts reported in different types of reviews of research partnerships in order to obtain a better understanding of the scope of the research partnership literature. This review of reviews is part of a Coordinated Multicenter Team approach to synthesise the research partnership literature with five conceptually linked literature reviews. The main research question was 'What principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts are reported in different types of research partnership approaches?'. We included articles describing a literature review of research partnerships using a systematic search strategy. We used an adapted version of the Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews tool to assess quality. Nine electronic databases were searched from inception to April 2018. Principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts were extracted from the included reviews and analysed using direct content analysis. We included 86 reviews using terms describing several research partnership approaches (e.g. community-based participatory research, participatory research, integrated knowledge translation). After the analyses, we synthesised 17 overarching principles and 11 overarching strategies and grouped them into one of the following subcategories: relationship between partners; co-production of knowledge; meaningful stakeholder engagement; capacity-building, support and resources; communication process; and ethical issues related to the collaborative research activities. Similarly, we synthesised 20 overarching outcomes and impacts on researchers, stakeholders, the community or society, and the research process. This review of reviews is the first that presents overarching principles, strategies, outcomes and impacts of research partnerships. This review is unique in scope as we synthesised literature across multiple research areas, involving different stakeholder groups. Our findings can be used as a first step to guide the initiation and maintenance of research partnerships and to create a classification system of the key domains of research partnerships, which may improve reporting consistency in the research partnership literature.

An internet-based study was conducted to identify and select relevant documents and websites containing information about the national approach to promote disability sports and physical activities in the Netherlands and Canada. Both governments promote high performance sports in similar ways, but use different strategies to promote recreational sports and physical activities. The Dutch approach is characterized by using time-limited programs focusing on enhancement of sports infrastructure and inter-sector collaboration in which municipalities have key roles. The Canadian government promotes recreational sports in disabled populations by supporting programs via bilateral agreements with provinces and territories. Furthermore, the level of integration of disability sports into mainstream sports differs between countries. The findings of this study may inspire policy makers from different countries to learn from one another's policies in order to optimize national approaches to promote disability sports and PA on all levels. Implications for rehabilitation It is recommended for policy makers of national governments to develop and implement policy programs that promote sports and physical activities among people with disabilities because of its potential impact on functioning, participation, quality of life, and health. Insight into national approaches to promote sport and physical activities is relevant for rehabilitation practice to understand ongoing opportunities for people with disabilities to stay physically active after rehabilitation through participation in home and/or community-based sport and physical activities. It seems worthwhile to integrate activities to promote sport and physical activities in rehabilitation in such a way that it fits with the current governmental approach. It is recommended to set up international collaborations to develop and share knowledge about effective and sustainable national approaches to promote sports and physical activities among people with disabilities.},

An expert panel of SCI researchers and stakeholders translated the guidelines and developed a supporting resource, using a KT process guided by an adapted version of the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II Instrument. Pilot tests with end-users were conducted throughout. The panel recommended (1) the two scientific exercise guidelines be combined and presented in a single message titled "The Canadian SCI physical activity guidelines"; (2) development of an online supporting resource, with educational and motivational information presented in "layers" to address the needs and preferences of diverse end-users. The top layer presents and explains the Canadian SCI physical activity guidelines. The deeper layers include information on benefits, overcoming barriers, activity examples, safety tips, and links to existing resources. Interviews with adults with SCI (n = 8) and survey-data from end-users (n = 90) showed that the guidelines and supporting resource were perceived as clear, useful, and appropriate. Using community-engaged methods, the two scientific SCI exercise guidelines were combined into one single physical activity guideline message. This KT process provides a template for groups in other countries to translate the scientific SCI exercise guidelines to their local settings using a similar systematic, community-engaged approach.

Data of 1,256 adults with physical disabilities and/or chronic diseases enrolled in the prospective cohort study Rehabilitation, Sports, and Active lifestyle (ReSpAct) were analyzed. Self-reported physical activity and four main psychosocial factors (i.e., self-efficacy, attitude, motivation, social support) were measured with questionnaires 3-6 weeks before discharge (T0) and 14 (T1), 33 (T2), and 52 (T3) weeks after discharge from rehabilitation. Hybrid multilevel regression models (corrected for age, sex, education level, diagnosis, counseling support) were used. Multivariable significant between-subject associations were found for self-efficacy (std β = .094; 95% CI [0.035, 0.153]) and intrinsic motivation (std β = .114; [0.036, 0.192]).

A total of 1100 people with a physical disability and/or chronic disease were included from the longitudinal cohort study Rehabilitation, Sports and Active lifestyle. All participants participated in a physical activity promotion programme in Dutch rehabilitation care. HR-QoL was assessed using the RAND-12 Health Status Inventory questionnaire at baseline (T0: 3-6 weeks before discharge) and at 14 (T1), 33 (T2) and 52 (T3) weeks after discharge from rehabilitation. A data-driven approach using Latent Class Growth Mixture modelling was used to determine HR-QoL trajectories. Multiple binomial multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine person-, disease- and lifestyle-related factors associated with trajectory membership. Three HR-QoL trajectories were identified: moderate (N = 635), high (N = 429) and recovery (N = 36). Trajectory membership was associated with person-related factors (age and body mass index), disease-related factors (perceived fatigue, perceived pain and acceptance of the disease) and one lifestyle-related factor (alcohol consumption) before discharge from rehabilitation. Most of the people who participated in a physical activity promotion programme obtained a relatively stable but moderate HR-QoL. The identified HR-QoL trajectories among our heterogeneous cohort are disease-overarching. Our findings suggest that people in rehabilitation may benefit from person-centred advice on management of fatigue and pain (e.g. activity pacing) and the acceptance of the disability.},

An introductory behavioural coaching session followed by eight, weekly follow-up sessions were delivered in-person or by phone/video call. The interventionist utilized behaviour-change techniques tailored to individual participants' readiness for change, barriers, and preferences. Participants set goals for achieving the SCI exercise guidelines. Coaching sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Changes over time in the number of barriers reported within each level of a social-ecological model of influences on physical activity (intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, policy). A total of 152 physical activity barriers were identified across 122 coaching sessions. Within each level of influence, the number of identified barriers decreased significantly over the intervention period. Intrapersonal barriers (e.g., lack of motivation, low self-efficacy) were most frequently reported and showed the greatest reductions over time. Using a new coding method to track changes in physical activity barriers, this pilot project showed a significant decrease in barriers over the course of a counselling intervention. Understanding physical activity barrier dynamics can improve the design of physical activity-enhancing interventions. Dynamic barrier-tracking methods could also be used to improve intervention implementation and evaluation.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate and explain the outcomes and impacts of a national network of researchers and community stakeholders over time in order to gain a better understanding of how, when and why research partnerships are successful (or not). This longitudinal multiple case study will use data from the Canadian Disability Participation Project, a large national network of researchers and community stakeholders working together to enhance community participation among people with physical disabilities. To maximise the impact of research conducted within the Canadian Disability Participation Project network, researchers are supported in developing and implementing knowledge translation plans. The components of the RE-AIM framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) will guide this study. Data will be collected from different perspectives (researchers, stakeholders) using different methods (logs, surveys, timeline interviews) at different time points during the years 2018-2021. A combination of data analysis methods, including network analysis and cluster analysis, will be used to study the RE-AIM components. Qualitative data will be used to supplement the findings and further understand the variation in the RE-AIM components over time and across groups. The outcomes, impacts and processes of conducting and disseminating research together with community stakeholders will be extensively studied. The longitudinal design of this study will provide a unique opportunity to examine research partnerships over time and understand the underlying processes using a variety of innovative research methods (e.g. network analyses, timeline interviews).

We investigated whether i.v. dipyridamole, a cGMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, increased the effects of inhaled NO and prevented rebound pulmonary hypertension. In 14 anesthetized and mechanically ventilated piglets, pulmonary hypertension was induced with U-46619, a thromboxane A(2) analogue. Response to NO and rebound pulmonary hypertension were evaluated without and with i.v. dipyridamole. Low-dose dipyridamole (10 micro g/kg/min) increased cardiac output and augmented the effects of inhaled NO on pulmonary vascular resistance, with marginal additive effect on mean pulmonary artery pressure. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 904 to 511 (20 parts per million NO) (p < 0.0005) and 358 dyne s cm(-5) (20 parts per million NO + dipyridamole) (p < 0.001 versus NO alone), and mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 29.0 to 20.5 (p < 0.0001) and 19.3 mm Hg (NS versus NO), respectively. Mean arterial pressure decreased from 85 to 74 mm Hg (dipyridamole + NO) (p < 0.01). High-dose dipyridamole (100 micro g/kg/min) with inhaled NO reduced pulmonary vascular resistance to 334 dyne s cm(-5) but also decreased mean arterial pressure to 57 mm Hg. Eight piglets developed rebound pulmonary hypertension. Two died of acute right ventricular failure and, in five, rebound pulmonary hypertension was prevented by low-dose dipyridamole. In conclusion, low-dose i.v. dipyridamole augments the effects of inhaled NO on right ventricular afterload with moderate changes in systemic hemodynamics, and can prevent rebound pulmonary hypertension.},

In a randomized, prospective, double-blind study 30 children (aged 1.5-20 months) received a continuous infusion of either 0.2 (group 0.2) or 0.3 microg/kg/min remifentanil (group 0.3) as part of a balanced anesthesia with 0.6 MAC sevoflurane. Heart rate, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, end tidal CO2 and pulse oxymetry were monitored throughout the procedure. Extubation times were noted, and recovery from anesthesia was evaluated using Aldrete scores. : Haemodynamic response to intubation was well blunted in both groups. No significant changes in hemodynamic variables were noted from induction of anesthesia until 10 min after intubation. From then on there was a decrease in HR and systolic arterial pressure, which remained significant throughout the procedure in both groups. Extubation times were similar in both groups: 7.3 min (2,1) in group 0.2 vs. 6.6 min (2,1) in group 0.3 (NS). The number of patients with an Aldrete score of nine or more was 14 (group 0.2) vs. 15 (group 0.3), 10 min after extubation (NS). Both dose regimens of remifentanil provided stable hemodynamic conditions during anesthesia for cardiac catheterization of children with congenital heart disease and allowed for rapid and adequate recovery.},

The Liver Intensive Care Group of Europe nominated a panel of recognized international experts who reviewed the available literature published from 1990 to January 2016 and produced clinical recommendations. The level of evidence and strength of recommendation were judged according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation system. Diagnosis of AKI should be based on the KDIGO criteria. The preoperative risk factors are more related to the patient's predisposing factors and post-operative risk factors tend to be difficult to control. Therefore, focusing on intra-operative risk factors it would be important to maintain an adequate hemodynamics and to keep inferior vena cava clamping as short as possible. Biomarkers to identify AKI at an early stage are available; however, there is a lack of robust data that indicates their true beneficial effect. Intraoperative renal replacement therapy may be beneficial in some selective cases whereas its postoperative timing is still under debate. Perioperative liver transplant risk factors for acute kidney injury are difficult to control. Therefore, the focus should be on intra-operative hemodynamics and nephrotoxic drugs avoidance. Prospective randomized trials are needed to show the beneficial effect of early replacement therapy. In this context, the new biomarkers would be helpful in identifying kidney injury earlier.},

The overall conversion rate was 17/265 (6.4%), equally distributed over the period of the study. Statistically significant factors for conversion were found to be LLR of the postero-superior (P-S) segments (SI, SIVa; SVII; SVIII) (12.7% converted versus 2.5% non-converted groups, P = 0.01) and a major compared with a minor hepatectomy (15.2% vs. 4.6%, P = 0.02 respectively). A R0 resection was achieved in 93.2% of cases. According to Dindo's classification, complications were recorded as grade I (n = 20); grade II (6); grade III (11) and grade IV(1) events (total morbidity rate of 14%). Univariate analysis identified a major hepatectomy and resection involving P-S segments as prognostic factors for conversion whereas multivariate analysis identified the latter as an independent risk factor [P = 0.003, odds ratio (OR) = 5.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.8-18.8]. LLR can be safely performed with low overall morbidity.

Liver graft hemodynamics were measured using the ultrasound transit time method to obtain portal (PVF) and arterial (HAF) hepatic flow. Measurements were recorded on the native liver, the portocaval shunt, following reperfusion and after biliary anastomosis. After LT HAF and PVF do not immediately return to normal values. Increased PVF was observed after graft implantation. Living donor LT showed the highest compliance to portal hyperperfusion. The amount of liver perfusion seemed to be related to the quality of the graft. A positive correlation for HAF, PVF and total hepatic blood flow with cardiac output was found (p = 0.001). Portal hypertension, macrosteatosis >30%, warm ischemia time and cardiac output, independently influence the hepatic flows. These results highlight the role of systemic hemodynamic management in LT to optimize hepatic perfusion, particularly in LDLT and split LT, where the highest flows were registered.},

Because POPH is frequently asymptomatic, screening with echocardiography is recommended. The only reliable technique, however, for diagnosing POPH is right heart catheterization (RHC). The aims of this study were to evaluate the current estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) cutoff value of 30 mm Hg and to determine a better cutoff value. One hundred fifty-two patients underwent pretransplant echocardiography between January 2005 and December 2010. These echocardiographic results were compared with pulmonary artery pressures measured during the pretransplant workup or at the beginning of the transplantation procedure (both by catheterization). With a cutoff value of 30 mm Hg, 74 of the 152 patients met the criteria for POPH on echocardiography, although the diagnosis was confirmed in only 7 patients during catheterization; this resulted in a specificity of 54%. It would have been more accurate to use a cutoff value of 38 mm Hg, which had a maximal specificity of 82% and, at the same time, guaranteed a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%. With the incorporation of the presence or absence of right ventricular dilatation, the specificity even increased to 93% for this new cutoff value. In conclusion, the prevalence of POPH was 4.6% among LT candidates in this study. We can recommend that LT candidates with an sPAP > 38 mm Hg should be referred for RHC. With the cutoff value increased from 30 to 38 mm Hg, the number of patients undergoing invasive RHC during their evaluation could be safely reduced.},

  abstract = {Myocardial performance index (MPI) permits a relative easy estimation of global left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function. It was shown that MPI inversely correlated strongly with the maximum derivative of LV pressure with respect to time (+dP/dtmax). The current study evaluated the change of MPI during and immediately after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) surgery and analyzed the relationship between MPI and hydraulic energy (exemplified by preload adjusted maximal power-PAMP) during that same period. The study was conducted in 45 patients undergoing CABG. After induction of anaesthesia, 10 min after revascularization and 2 h postoperatively, haemodynamics were assessed. Preload was characterized by LV end-diastolic area indexed for BSA (LVEDAI); afterload was estimated by arterial elastance (Ea) and indexed systemic vascular resistance (SVRI). Global myocardial performance was indicated in terms of MPI and contractility was achieved by PAMP. Myocardial performance index increased postoperatively (0.44 +/- 0.13, 0.37 +/- 0.17 and 0.50 +/- 0.16, respectively; P < 0.001). Preload adjusted maximal power did not alter significantly (1.90 +/- 1.24, 2.02 +/- 1.34 and 2.12 +/- 1.00 W cm(-2)*10(4), respectively). Left ventricular enddiastolic area indexed did not change. Arterial elastance augmented to 0.76 +/- 0.39, 0.80 +/- 0.40 and 1.01 +/- 0.43 mmHg ml(-1), respectively; P < 0.001. Systemic vascular resistance did not change. A relationship was found between 1-MPI/LVEDAI2 and PAMP (R2 = 0.50). This study shows that in the setting of CABG surgery, MPI appears to be a good measure of global LV function.},

Liver transplantation (LTx) may be curative, but is usually restricted to patients with mild-to-moderate POPH. The presence of severe POPH may be a contraindication to transplantation because of the elevated risk of peritransplantation and post-transplantation morbidity and mortality. This report describes a series of seven patients with onset of moderate (two patients) or severe (five patients) POPH before LTx, of whom six were treated with oral vasodilator therapy for POPH. Although previous studies recommend aggressive parenteral prostacyclin therapy (epoprostenol), we describe the opportunity to treat cases of severe POPH with an oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (sildenafil) and/or an endothelin receptor antagonist (bosentan/ambrisentan) as a bridge to successful LTx in selected patients.},

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is curative for pancytopenia, but may not prevent the development of non-hematological malignancies. We describe a 26-year-old male patient with FA and Marfan syndrome who in 1994 underwent successful HSCT with bone marrow stem cells from his human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sister. In 2006, three lesions in the liver were detected and resected. The three lesions all showed activation of the β-catenin pathway and were histologically characterized by a highly differentiated steatotic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with remnants of the underlying adenoma from which it arose, a hepatocellular adenoma with foci of well-differentiated HCC, and a cholestatic adenoma. Risk factors for the emergence of HCC included FA itself, the use of androgens for a period of 3 years preceding HSCT and toxicity of the conditioning regimen. Because of the danger of developing additional HCC, liver transplantation was proposed, taking into consideration that immunosuppression would increase the risk of other malignancies. By using part of the liver of the sister, who already acted as bone marrow donor 13 years earlier, immunosuppression could be avoided. Liver transplantation was performed in 2007 without complication. Five years after liver transplantation the patient is doing well. This case is twofold special being the first case reporting FA co-occurring with Marfan syndrome and being the first reported case of FA treated for HCC by liver transplantation from a HLA-identical sibling donor without the use of immunosuppression.},

We evaluated haemodynamic effects of i.v. glycopyrrolate during remifentanil-sevoflurane anaesthesia for cardiac catheterization of children with congenital heart disease. Forty-five children undergoing general anaesthesia with remifentanil and sevoflurane were randomly allocated to receive either saline, glycopyrrolate 6 microg kg(-1) or glycopyrrolate 12 microg kg(-1). After induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, i.v. placebo or glycopyrrolate was administered. An infusion of remifentanil at the rate of 0.15 microg kg(-1) min(-1) was started, sevoflurane continued at 0.6 MAC and cisatracurium 0.2 mg kg(-1) was given. Heart rate (HR) and non-invasive arterial pressures were monitored and noted every minute for the first 10 min and then every 2.5 min for subsequent maximum of 45 min. Baseline HR [mean (SD)] of 117 (20) beats min(-1) decreased significantly from 12.5 min onwards after starting the remifentanil infusion in the control group [106 (18) at 12.5 min and 99 (16) beats min(-1) at 45 min]. In the groups receiving glycopyrrolate, no significant decrease in HR was noticed. Glycopyrrolate at 12 microg kg(-1) induced tachycardia between 5 and 9 min after administration. Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures decreased gradually, but there were no significant differences in the pressures between groups. I.V. glycopyrrolate 6 microg kg(-1) prevents bradycardia during general anaesthesia with remifentanil and sevoflurane for cardiac catheterization in children with congenital heart disease. Administering 12 microg kg(-1) of glycopyrrolate temporarily induces tachycardia and offers no additional advantage.},

During an 18-month period, all adult patients that needed treatment for a unilateral inguinal or femoral hernia were treated by the TIPP repair using the Polysoft mesh. This group was retrospectively compared with a historical cohort of patients treated by the Lichtenstein technique. Our policy concerning type of anaesthesia, post-operative pain management and visual analogue scale measurements did not change over the study period. For post-operative pain evaluation, the visual analogue scale was used (0-10) and scores were measured after 6 h, 24 h, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year and yearly thereafter. Recurrence rates were evaluated at time of clinical examinations. In total, 142 patients have been analysed with the TIPP technique (group I) versus 136 patients operated in the previous 2 years with a Lichtenstein repair (group II). In group I, 112 patients (78.9%) received a medium size patch of 14 x 7.5 cm and 30 patients (21.1%) had a large patch (16 x 9 cm). The mean operative time for a TIPP procedure was statistically shorter than for a Lichtenstein repair, 33 versus 44 min, respectively (p = 0.04). After 24 h, 1 week and 1 month post-surgery, there was significantly less post-operative pain observed in the TIPP group than in the Lichtenstein group. In total, four recurrences were observed in the TIPP group (2.8%), of which one laterally and three medially. In group II, seven recurrences were observed in total (5.1%), of which five were detected within 2 years of follow-up (3.7%). For surgeons performing the Lichtenstein repair but looking for modifications concerning pain relief and a quicker procedure, the TIPP approach is a feasible alternative that seems to be associated with less post-operative pain.},

An e-Delphi method was used with an extended interdisciplinary panel of experts to validate the final recommendations. Forty-three articles were included in the systematic review. A consensus was reached among experts after the second round. Patients should be screened for malnutrition and treated whenever possible. Prophylactic nasogastric intubation and prophylactic abdominal drainage may be omitted, and early extubation should be considered. Early oral intake, mobilization, and multimodal-balanced analgesia are recommended. The current ERAS recommendations were elaborated based on the best available evidence and endorsed by the e-Delphi method.

Although rewarming of patients before surgery has been used as a preventive measure and some guidelines recommend it, the implementation of prewarming for every surgical patient is cumbersome. Therefore, we sought to determine the efficacy of two novel prewarming methods that could facilitate prewarming in daily practice. This was a prospective, randomized, multi-center, controlled study. After IRB approval and informed consent, 90 patients undergoing surgery of 30-120 min duration with general anesthesia were randomly assigned to three groups: 1) standard preoperative insulation (Group A); 2) passive preoperative insulation with a commercial prewarming suit (Group B); 3) active preoperative prewarming with a forced-air warmer connected to a prewarming suit (Group C). All patients received warmed IV fluids and intraoperative forced air warming after induction of anesthesia. Oral temperatures were recorded in the preoperative and postoperative periods. Intraoperative core temperatures were measured with an esophageal probe. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Scheffé's test identified a significantly higher core temperature in the actively prewarmed group (Group C) compared to both passive groups (A, B) at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min (P<0.05) after induction of anesthesia and at the end of surgery. During the first 30 min after admission at PACU, also higher oral temperatures were measured in Group C, compared with both passive insulation groups. In our study active prewarming with a forced-air warmer and an insulating prewarming suit achieves significantly higher core temperatures during anesthesia and at the end of surgery and avoids hypothermia at the end of surgery compared to commercial or conventional insulation techniques.},

We demonstrated in the past that volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury during liver resection. In this randomized study, we examined if volatile anesthetics have an effect on acute graft injury and clinical outcomes after liver transplantation. Cadaveric liver transplant recipients were enrolled from January 2009 to September 2012 at 3 University Centers (Zurich/Sao Paulo/Ghent). Recipients were randomly assigned to propofol (control group) or sevoflurane anesthesia. Postoperative peak of aspartate transaminase was defined as primary endpoint, secondary endpoints were early allograft dysfunction, in-hospital complications, intensive care unit, and hospital stay. Ninety-eight recipients were randomized to propofol (n = 48) or sevoflurane (n = 50). Median peak aspartate transaminase after transplantation was 925 (interquartile range, 512-3274) in the propofol and 1097 (interquartile range, 540-2633) in the sevoflurane group. In the propofol arm, 11 patients (23%) experienced early allograft dysfunction, 7 (14%) in the sevoflurane one (odds ratio, 0.64 (0.20 to 2.02, P = 0.45). There were 4 mortalities (8.3%) in the propofol and 2 (4.0%) in the sevoflurane group. Overall and major complication rates were not different. An effect on clinical outcomes was observed favoring the sevoflurane group (less severe complications), but without significance. This first multicenter trial comparing propofol with sevoflurane anesthesia in liver transplantation shows no difference in biochemical markers of acute organ injury and clinical outcomes between the 2 regimens. Sevoflurane has no significant added beneficial effect on ischemia-reperfusion injury compared to propofol.},

We have evaluated the effects of IV dipyridamole, a cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitor, on the magnitude and duration of action of inhaled nitric oxide (NO)-mediated pulmonary vasodilation. We hypothesized that inhibition of cGMP degradation could augment and prolong the pulmonary vasodilating effects of NO and allow for intermittent NO inhalation. In eight anesthetized and mechanically ventilated piglets, IV U-46619, a thromboxane A(2) analog, was used to induce pulmonary hypertension. The effects of 2, 5, and 10 ppm of NO, delivered during 4 min for each concentration and followed by a 10-min NO-free interval after each NO concentration, were evaluated without and with dipyridamole. Pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 825 +/- 49 dynes. s. cm(-5) (U-46619) to 533 +/- 48 dynes. s. cm(-5) (10 ppm NO) (P < 0.05 versus U-46619) and 396 +/- 42 dynes. s. cm(-5) (dipyridamole 10 microg kg-1x min-1 and 10 ppm NO) (P <0.05 versus NO), and cardiac output increased from 1.93 +/- 0.09 L/min to 2.03 +/- 0.13 L/min and 2.60 +/- 0.30 L/min (P < 0.05 versus NO). Mean arterial blood pressure decreased from 90 +/- 5 mm Hg (10 ppm NO) to 75 +/- 3 mm Hg (dipyridamole plus 10 ppm NO) (P < 0.01). The pulmonary vasodilation obtained with NO alone could be prolonged from 12 to 42 min when inhaled NO was combined with IV dipyridamole, accounting for a time-weighted reduction in NO exposure by 72%. We conclude that dipyridamole augments the effects of NO on right ventricular afterload, allows for intermittent NO inhalation, and can significantly reduce exposure to NO. IV dipyridamole prolongs the action of inhaled nitric oxide (NO) in a piglet model of acute pulmonary hypertension. Intermittent NO inhalation combined with IV dipyridamole decreases pulmonary artery pressure for a prolonged period of time and reduces exposure to NO.},

  abstract = {Critically ill cirrhotic patients are increasingly transplanted, but there is no consensus about futile liver transplantation (LT). Therefore, the decision to delay or deny LT is often extensively debated. These debates arise from different opinions of futility among transplant team members. This study aims to achieve a multinational and multidisciplinary consensus on the definition of futility in LT and to develop well-articulated criteria for not proceeding with LT due to futility. Thirty-five international experts from anesthesiology/intensive care, hepatology, and transplant surgery were surveyed using the Delphi method. More than 70% of similar answers to a question were necessary to define agreement. The panel recommended patient and graft survival at 1 year after LT to define futility. Severe frailty and persistent fever or <72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy in case of ongoing sepsis were considered reasons to delay LT. A simple assessment of the number of organs failing was considered the most appropriate way to decide whether LT should be delayed or denied, with respiratory, circulatory and metabolic failures having the most influence in this decision. The thresholds of severity of organ failures contraindicating LT for which a consensus was achieved were a Pao2/FiO2 ratio<150 mm Hg, a norepinephrine dose >1 μg/kg per minute and a serum lactate level >9 mmol/L. Our expert panel provides a consensus on the definition of futile LT and on specific criteria for postponing or denying LT. A framework that may facilitate the decision if a patient is too sick for transplant is presented.},

Here, we found that neither structural changes nor subtle differences in the E2-E3 interaction surface are possible explanations for the functional specificity of UbcH5B and UbcH7 in their interaction with c-Cbl. The quick transfer of ubiquitin from the UbcH5B-Ub thioester to c-Cbl or other ubiquitin acceptors suggests that UbcH5B might functionally be a relatively pliable E2 enzyme. In contrast, the UbcH7-Ub thioester is too stable to transfer ubiquitin under our assay conditions, indicating that UbcH7 might be a more specific E2 enzyme. Our results imply that the interaction specificity between c-Cbl and E2 is required but not sufficient for transfer of ubiquitin to potential targets.},

Insulin signaling keeps FOXO/DAF-16 cytoplasmic, and hence transcriptionally inactive. Conversely, as in loss of insulin signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate FOXO/DAF-16 through nuclear accumulation. How ROS regulate the nuclear translocation of FOXO/DAF-16 is largely unknown. Cysteine oxidation can stabilize protein-protein interactions through the formation of disulfide-bridges when cells encounter ROS. Using a proteome-wide screen that identifies ROS-induced mixed disulfide-dependent complexes, we discovered several interaction partners of FOXO4, one of which is the nuclear import receptor transportin-1. We show that disulfide formation with transportin-1 is required for nuclear localization and the activation of FOXO4/DAF-16 induced by ROS, but not by the loss of insulin signaling. This molecular mechanism for nuclear shuttling is conserved in C. elegans and directly connects redox signaling to the longevity protein FOXO/DAF-16.},

  abstract = {Endocannabinoid peptides, or "pepcans," are endogenous ligands of the CB1 cannabinoid receptor. Depending on their length, they display diverse activity: For instance, the nona-peptide Pepcan-9, also known as hemopressin, is a powerful inhibitor of CB1, whereas the longer variant Pepcan-12, which extends by only three amino acid residues at the N-terminus, acts on both CB1 and CB2 as an allosteric modulator, although with diverse effects. Despite active research on their pharmacological applications, very little is known about structure-activity relationships of pepcans. Different structures have been proposed for the nona-peptide, which has also been reported to form fibrillar aggregates. This might have affected the outcome and reproducibility of bioactivity studies. In an attempt of elucidating the determinants of both biological activity and aggregation propensity of Pepcan-9 and Pepcan-12, we have performed their structure characterization in solvent systems characterized by different polarity and pH. We have found that, while disordered in aqueous environment, both peptides display helical structure in less polar environment, mimicking the proteic receptor milieu. In the case of Pepcan-9, this structure is fully consistent with the observed modulation of the CB1. For Pepcan-12, whose allosteric binding site is still unknown, the presented structure is compatible with the binding at one of the previously proposed allosteric sites on CB1. These findings open the way to structure-driven design of selective peptide modulators of CB1.},

The Src Homology 2 (SH2) domain mediated interaction between cSrc kinase and ER plays a key role in this; however the molecular determinants of this interaction have not been elucidated. Here, we used phosphorylated ER peptide and semisynthetic protein constructs in a combined biochemical and structural study to, for the first time, provide a quantitative and structural characterization of the cSrc SH2-ER interaction. Fluorescence polarization experiments delineated the SH2 binding motif in the ER sequence. Chemical shift perturbation analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations allowed us to put forward a 3D model of the ER-SH2 interaction. The structural basis of this protein-protein interaction has been compared with that of the high affinity SH2 binding sequence GpYEEI. The ER features a different binding mode from that of the "two-pronged plug two-hole socket" model in the so-called specificity determining region. This alternative binding mode is modulated via the folding of ER helix 12, a structural element directly C-terminal of the key phosphorylated tyrosine. The present findings provide novel molecular entries for understanding nongenomic ER signaling and targeting the corresponding disease states.},

  abstract = {GH (growth hormone) binding to the GHR (GH receptor) triggers essential signalling pathways that promote growth and metabolic regulation. The sensitivity of the cells to GH is mainly controlled by the endocytosis of the receptor via βTrCP (β-transducin repeat-containing protein). In the present study, we show that βTrCP interacts directly via its WD40 domain with the UbE (ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis) motif in GHR, promoting GHR ubiquitination in vitro. NMR experiments demonstrated that the UbE motif is essentially unstructured, and, together with functional mapping of the UbE and βTrCP WD40 residues necessary for binding, led to a unique interaction model of βTrCP with GHR-UbE. This interaction is different from the conventional βTrCP-substrate interactions described to date. This interaction therefore represents a promising specific target to develop drugs that inhibit GHR endocytosis and increase GH sensitivity in cachexia patients.},

We analyzed the effect of sulforaphane on the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. Sulforaphane inhibited pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro with IC(50)s of around 10-15 μM and induced apoptosis. In pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse model, administration of sulforaphane showed remarkable inhibition of tumor growth without apparent toxicity noticed. We found that sulforaphane induced the degradation of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) client proteins and blocked the interaction of Hsp90 with its cochaperone p50(Cdc37) in pancreatic cancer cells. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) with an isoleucine-specific labeling strategy, we overcame the protein size limit of conventional NMR and studied the interaction of sulforaphane with full-length Hsp90 dimer (170 kDa) in solution. NMR revealed multiple chemical shifts in sheet 2 and the adjacent loop in Hsp90 N-terminal domain after incubation of Hsp90 with sulforaphane. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry further mapped a short peptide in this region that was tagged with sulforaphane. These data suggest a new mechanism of sulforaphane that disrupts protein-protein interaction in Hsp90 complex for its chemopreventive activity.},

GR-RBPs are bipartite proteins containing a RNA recognition motif (RRM) followed by a glycine-rich region. Here, we studied the structural basis of nucleic acid binding of full-length Nicotiana tabacum GR-RBP1. NMR studies of NtGR-RBP1 show that the glycine-rich domain, while intrinsically disordered, is responsible for mediating self-association by transient interactions with its RRM domain (NtRRM). Both NtGR-RBP1 and NtRRM bind specifically and with low micromolar affinity to RNA and single-stranded DNA. The solution structure of NtRRM shows that it is a canonical RRM domain. A HADDOCK model of the NtRRM-RNA complex, based on NMR chemical shift and NOE data, shows that nucleic acid binding results from a combination of stacking and electrostatic interactions with conserved RRM residues. Finally, DNA melting experiments demonstrate that NtGR-RBP1 is more efficient in melting CTG containing nucleic acids than isolated NtRRM. Together, our study supports the model that self-association of GR-RBPs by the glycine-rich region results in cooperative unfolding of non-native substrate structures, thereby enhancing its chaperone function.},

The size of the repressor makes it a challenging target, putting constraints on both expression conditions and sample preparation methods to overcome problems associated with studies of larger proteins by NMR. We optimized protocols for the production of deuterated functionally active thermostable dimeric Lac repressor and its core domain mutants. The Lac repressor core domain has never been obtained as a recombinant protein, possibly due to the observed toxicity to the host cells. We overcame the core domain induced toxicity by co-expression of this domain with the full length Lac repressor, combined with a stringent control of culture conditions. Significant overexpression was only obtained if during all stages of pre-culturing the bacteria were kept in their exponential growth phase at low density. The sensitivity of NMR measurements is dramatically affected by buffer conditions; we therefore used a thermofluor buffer optimization screen to determine the optimal buffer conditions. The combined thermofluor and NMR screening method yielded thermostable fully functional Lac repressor domain samples suitable for high-resolution NMR studies. The optimized procedures to adapt Escherichia coli to growth in D2O, to overcome toxicity, and to optimize protein sample conditions provides a broad range of universally applicable techniques for production of larger proteins for NMR spectroscopy.},

Comparison of these assignments to solid-state NMR (ssNMR) data obtained on two BamA constructs including the transmembrane domain and one or two soluble POTRA domains suggested that the fold of POTRA domain 5 critically depends on the interface with POTRA 4. Using specific labeling schemes we furthermore obtained ssNMR resonance assignments for residues in the extracellular loop 6 that is known to be crucial for BamA-mediated substrate folding and insertion.

The structural basis of these interactions is usually studied using histone peptide models, neglecting the nucleosomal context. Here, we provide the structural and thermodynamic basis for the recognition of H3K36-methylated (H3K36me) nucleosomes by the PSIP1-PWWP domain, based on extensive mutational analysis, advanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and computational approaches. The PSIP1-PWWP domain binds H3K36me3 peptide and DNA with low affinity, through distinct, adjacent binding surfaces. PWWP binding to H3K36me nucleosomes is enhanced approximately 10,000-fold compared to a methylated peptide. Based on mutational analyses and NMR data, we derive a structure of the complex showing that the PWWP domain is bound to H3K36me nucleosomes through simultaneous interactions with both methylated histone tail and nucleosomal DNA. Concerted binding to the methylated histone tail and nucleosomal DNA underlies the high- affinity, specific recognition of H3K36me nucleosomes by the PSIP1-PWWP domain. We propose that this bipartite binding mechanism is a distinctive and general property in the recognition of histone modifications close to the nucleosome core.},

A model of the Kid toxin interacting with the uncleavable mimetic 5'-AdUACA-3' is available. To evaluate this model, a significant collection of mutants in some of the key residues proposed to be involved in RNA binding (T46, A55, T69 and R85) or RNA cleavage (R73, D75 and H17) were analysed by mass spectrometry in RNA binding and cleavage assays. A pair of substrates, 5'-AUACA-3', and its uncleavable mimetic 5'-AdUACA-3', used to establish the model and structure of the Kid-RNA complex, were used in both the RNA cleavage and binding assays. A second RNA substrate, 5'-UUACU-3' efficiently cleaved by Kid both in vivo and in vitro, was also used in the cleavage assays. Compared with the wild-type protein, mutations in the residues of the catalytic site abolished RNA cleavage without substantially altering RNA binding. Mutations in residues proposed to be involved in RNA binding show reduced binding efficiency and a corresponding decrease in RNA cleavage efficiency. The cleavage profiles of the different mutants were similar with the two substrates used, but RNA cleavage required much lower protein concentrations when the 5'-UUACU-3' substrate was used. Protein synthesis and growth assays are consistent with there being a correlation between the RNase activity of Kid and its inhibitory potential. These results give important support to the available models of Kid RNase and the Kid-RNA complex.},

One guanine base is flipped out of register and positioned in a pocket contacting residues from both HhH motifs of XPF. Comparison to other HhH-containing proteins indicates a one-residue deletion in the second HhH motif of XPF that has altered the hairpin conformation, thereby permitting ssDNA interactions.

Recognition of altered DNA, including bulky adducts, pyrimidine dimers and interstrand crosslinks (ICL), partially depends on proteins containing helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) domains. To understand how ICL is specifically recognized by the Fanconi anemia proteins FANCM and FAAP24, we determined the structure of the HhH domain of FAAP24. Although it resembles other HhH domains, the FAAP24 domain contains a canonical hairpin motif followed by distorted motif. The HhH domain can bind various DNA substrates; using nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiments, we demonstrate that the canonical HhH motif is required for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) binding, whereas the unstructured N-terminus can interact with single-stranded DNA. Both DNA binding surfaces are used for binding to ICL-like single/double-strand junction-containing DNA substrates. A structural model for FAAP24 bound to dsDNA has been made based on homology with the translesion polymerase iota. Site-directed mutagenesis, sequence conservation and charge distribution support the dsDNA-binding model. Analogous to other HhH domain-containing proteins, we suggest that multiple FAAP24 regions together contribute to binding to single/double-strand junction, which could contribute to specificity in ICL DNA recognition.},

Pax-8 activity is regulated via a redox-based mechanism centered on the glutathionylation of specific cysteines in the N-terminal region (Cys45 and Cys57). These residues belong to a highly evolutionary conserved DNA binding site: the Paired Box (Prd) domain. Crystallographic protein-DNA complexes of the homologues Pax-6 and Pax-5 showed a bipartite Prd domain consisting of two helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs separated by an extended linker region. Here, by means of nuclear magnetic resonance, we show for the first time that the HTH motifs are largely defined in the unbound Pax-8 Prd domain. Our findings contrast with previous induced fit models, in which Pax-8 is supposed to largely fold upon DNA binding. Importantly, our data provide the structural basis for the enhanced chemical reactivity of residues Cys45 and Cys57 and explain clinical missense mutations that are not obviously related to the DNA binding interface of the paired box domain. Finally, sequence conservation suggests that our findings could be a general feature of the Pax family transcription factors.},

Our NMR analyses indicate virtually identical structures but reveal remarkable differences in local dynamics, with striking correspondence between experimental data (i.e., (15)N relaxation and H/D exchange rates) and data from Molecular Dynamics simulations. While overall the cores of both proteins are very rigid on the pico- to nanosecond timescale and are largely protected from H/D exchange, the two point mutations stabilize helices alpha1, alpha4, and alpha5 and locally destabilize the H-bond network of the beta-sheet (beta7-beta9). In particular, it emerges that helix alpha5, undergoing some fast destabilizing motions (on the pico- to nanosecond timescale) in wild-type lipase, is substantially rigidified by the mutation of Phe180 for a proline at its N terminus. This observation could be explained by the release of some penalizing strain, as proline does not require any "N-capping" hydrogen bond acceptor in the i+3 position. The combined experimental and simulated data thus indicate that reduced molecular flexibility of the F180P/S205G mutant lipase underlies its increased stability, and thus reveals a correlation between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic thermodynamic properties. This could contribute to the observed altered enzyme activity, as may be inferred from recent studies linking enzyme kinetics to their local molecular dynamics.},

We performed a global yeast-two hybrid screen to study the specificity of interactions between catalytic domains of the 35 human E2s with 250 RING-type E3s. Our analysis showed over 300 high-quality interactions, uncovering a large fraction of new E2-E3 pairs. Both within the E2 and the E3 cohorts, several members were identified that are more versatile in their interaction behaviour than others. We also found that the physical interactions of our screen compare well with reported functional E2-E3 pairs in in vitro ubiquitination experiments. For validation we confirmed the interaction of several versatile E2s with E3s in in vitro protein interaction assays and we used mutagenesis to alter the E3 interactions of the E2 specific for K63 linkages, UBE2N(Ubc13), towards the K48-specific UBE2D2(UbcH5B). Our data provide a detailed, genome-wide overview of binary E2-E3 interactions of the human ubiquitination system.},

  abstract = {Bacterial translation initiation factor IF2 complexed with GTP binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit, promotes ribosomal binding of fMet-tRNA, and favors the joining of the small and large ribosomal subunits yielding a 70S initiation complex ready to enter the translation elongation phase. Within the IF2 molecule subdomain G3, which is believed to play an important role in the IF2-30S interaction, is positioned between the GTP-binding G2 and the fMet-tRNA binding C-terminal subdomains. In this study the solution structure of subdomain G3 of Geobacillus stearothermophilus IF2 has been elucidated. G3 forms a core structure consisting of two β-sheets with each four anti-parallel strands, followed by a C-terminal α-helix. In line with its role as linker between G3 and subdomain C1, this helix has no well-defined orientation but is endowed with a dynamic nature. The structure of the G3 core is that of a typical OB-fold module, similar to that of the corresponding subdomain of Thermus thermophilus IF2, and to that of other known RNA-binding modules such as IF2-C2, IF1 and subdomains II of elongation factors EF-Tu and EF-G. Structural comparisons have resulted in a model that describes the interaction between IF2-G3 and the 30S ribosomal subunit.},

The unassigned resonances are represented by additional atoms or groups of atoms that have no interaction with the regular protein atoms except through distance restraints. These so-called "proxy" residues can be used to generate NOE-based distance restraints in a similar fashion as for the assigned part of the protein. If sufficient NOE information is available, the restraints are expected to place the proxies at positions close to the correct atoms for the unassigned resonance, which can facilitate subsequent assignment. Convergence can be further improved by supplying additional information about the possible identities of the unassigned resonances. We have implemented this approach in the widely used automated assignment and structure calculation protocols ARIA and CANDID. We find that it significantly increases the robustness of structure calculations with regard to missing assignments and yields structures of higher quality. Our approach is still able to find correctly folded structures with up to 30% randomly missing resonance assignments, and even when only backbone and beta resonances are present! This should be of significant value to NMR-based structural proteomics initiatives.},

Yet, the calculated (15)N CSA tensors in phosphorylated model peptides were in range of values experimentally observed for non-phosphorylated proteins. The extent of the phosphorylation induced changes suggests that the amidic (15)N CSA tensor in phosphorylated proteins could be reasonably well approximated with averaged CSA tensor values experimentally determined for non-phosphorylated amino acids in practical NMR applications, where chemical surrounding of the phosphorylated site is not known a priori in majority of cases.

Using NMR spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the Rad6b binding site, for the Rad18 RING domain, strongly resembles that of other E2/E3 RING/U-box complexes. We show that the homodimeric Rad18 RING domain can recruit two Rad6b E2 enzymes, whereas the full-length Rad18 homodimer binds only to a single Rad6b molecule. Such asymmetry is a common feature of RING-RING heterodimers and has been observed for the CHIP U-box homodimer. We propose that asymmetry may be a common feature of dimeric RING E3 ligases.},

Human, cytosolic Hsp90 is dedicated to folding of chiefly signal transduction components. The chaperoning mechanism of Hsp90 is controlled by ATP and various cochaperones, but is poorly understood and controversial. Here, we characterized the Apo and ATP states of the 170-kDa human Hsp90 full-length protein by NMR spectroscopy in solution, and we elucidated the mechanism of the inhibition of its ATPase by its cochaperone p23. We assigned isoleucine side chains of Hsp90 via specific isotope labeling of their δ-methyl groups, which allowed the NMR analysis of the full-length protein. We found that ATP caused exclusively local changes in Hsp90's N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain. Native mass spectrometry showed that Hsp90 and p23 form a 22 complex via a positively cooperative mechanism. Despite this stoichiometry, NMR data indicated that the complex was not fully symmetric. The p23-dependent NMR shifts mapped to both the lid and the adenine end of Hsp90's ATP binding pocket, but also to large parts of the middle domain. Shifts distant from the p23 binding site reflect p23-induced conformational changes in Hsp90. Together, we conclude that it is Hsp90's nucleotide-binding domain that triggers the formation of the Hsp90(2)p23(2) complex. We anticipate that our NMR approach has significant impact on future studies of full-length Hsp90 with cofactors and substrates, but also for the development of Hsp90 inhibiting anticancer drugs.},

Pulsed-field gradient NMR spectroscopy allows one to measure the translational diffusion with high accuracy.

Here, we show that a combination of selective isotope labelling, 2D ¹H-¹³C methyl-TROSY (transverse relaxation-optimised spectroscopy) and DOSY allows one to study diffusion properties of large protein complexes. We propose that a 3D DOSY-heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) pulse sequence, that uses the TROSY effect of the HMQC sequence for ¹³C methyl-labelled proteins, is highly suitable for measuring the diffusion coefficient of large proteins. We used the 20 kDa co-chaperone p23 as model system to test this 3D DOSY-TROSY technique under various conditions. We determined the diffusion coefficient of p23 in viscous solutions, mimicking large complexes of up to 200 kDa. We found the experimental data to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. To demonstrate the use for complex formation, we applied this technique to record the formation of a complex of p23 with the molecular chaperone Hsp90, which is around 200 kDa. We anticipate that 3D DOSY-TROSY will be a useful tool to study conformational changes in large protein complexes.},

The factors governing their affinity remain elusive however, especially when it comes to describing dissociation rates (koff). Here we demonstrate that, next to direct contributions from the interface, the non-interacting surface (NIS) also plays an important role in binding affinity, especially polar and charged residues. Their percentage on the NIS is conserved over orthologous complexes indicating an evolutionary selection pressure. Their effect on binding affinity can be explained by long-range electrostatic contributions and surface-solvent interactions that are known to determine the local frustration of the protein complex surface. Including these in a simple model significantly improves the affinity prediction of protein complexes from structural models. The impact of mutations outside the interacting surface on binding affinity is supported by experimental alanine scanning mutagenesis data. These results enable the development of more sophisticated and integrated biophysical models of binding affinity and open new directions in experimental control and modulation of biomolecular interactions.},

The presence of the covalent bonds between the subunits stabilizes the unswapped dimer, and allows distinct evaluation of the structural and dynamic effects of the swapping with respect to the dimerization process. In comparison with the monomeric subunit, which, in solution has a compact structure without any propensity for local unfolding, both swapped and unswapped dimers show increased flexibility. NMR analysis, together with urea denaturation and hydrogen–deuterium exchange data, indicates that the two dimers have increased conformational fluctuations. Furthermore, we found that the rate-limiting step of both the swapping and unswapping pathways is the detachment of the N-terminal helices from the monomers.

Because LAIR-1 and GPVI also display overlapping collagen-binding specificities, a common structural basis for collagen recognition would appear likely. Therefore, it is crucial to gain insight into the molecular interaction of both receptors with their ligand to prevent unwanted cross-reactions during therapeutic intervention. We determined the crystal structure of LAIR-1 and mapped its collagen-binding site by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titrations and mutagenesis. Our data identify R59, E61, and W109 as key residues for collagen interaction. These residues are strictly conserved in LAIR-1 and GPVI alike; however, they are located outside the previously proposed GPVI collagen-binding site. Our data provide evidence for an unanticipated mechanism of collagen recognition common to LAIR-1 and GPVI.

We here propose a magnetic resonance imaging temperature mapping method in which drug delivery systems serve not only to improve tumor targeting, but also as an accurate and absolute nano-thermometer. This method is based on the temperature-dependent chemical shift difference between water protons and the protons in different groups of drug delivery systems. We show that the chemical shift of the protons in the ethylene oxide group in polyethylene glycol (PEG) is temperature-independent, whereas the proton resonance of water decreases with increasing temperature. The frequency difference between both resonances is linear and does not depend on pH and physiological salt conditions. In addition, we show that the proton resonance of the methyl group in N-(2-hydroxypropyl)-methacrylamide (HPMA) is temperature-independent. Therefore, PEGylated liposomes, polymeric mPEG-b-pHPMAm-Lac2 micelles and HPMA copolymers can provide a temperature-independent reference frequency for absolute magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry. Subsequently, we show that multigradient echo MR imaging with PEGylated liposomes in situ allows accurate, time-resolved temperature mapping. In conclusion, nanocarrier materials may serve as highly versatile tools for tumor-targeted drug delivery, acting not only as hyperthermia-responsive drug delivery systems, but also as accurate and precise nano-thermometers.},

  abstract = {Small ligands are a powerful way to control the function of protein complexes via dynamic binding interfaces. The classic example is found in gene transcription where small ligands regulate nuclear receptor binding to coactivator proteins via the dynamic activation function 2 (AF2) interface. Current ligands target the ligand-binding pocket side of the AF2. Few ligands are known, which selectively target the coactivator side of the AF2, or which can be selectively switched from one side of the interface to the other. We use NMR spectroscopy and modeling to identify a natural product, which targets the retinoid X receptor (RXR) at both sides of the AF2. We then use chemical synthesis, cellular screening and X-ray co-crystallography to split this dual activity, leading to a potent and molecularly efficient RXR agonist, and a first-of-kind inhibitor selective for the RXR/coactivator interaction. Our findings justify future exploration of natural products at dynamic protein interfaces.},

Hsp70 acts early and Hsp90 late in the folding path, yet the molecular basis of this timing is enigmatic, mainly because the substrate specificity of Hsp90 is poorly understood. Here, we obtained a structural model of Hsp90 in complex with its natural disease-associated substrate, the intrinsically disordered Tau protein. Hsp90 binds to a broad region in Tau that includes the aggregation-prone repeats. Complementarily, a 106-Å-long substrate-binding interface in Hsp90 enables many low-affinity contacts. This allows recognition of scattered hydrophobic residues in late folding intermediates that remain after early burial of the Hsp70 sites. Our model resolves the paradox of how Hsp90 specifically selects for late folding intermediates but also for some intrinsically disordered proteins-through the eyes of Hsp90 they look the same.},

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were carried out for structural data. Synthetic µ-CnIIIC decreased twitch tension in mouse hemidiaphragms (IC(50) = 150 nM), and displayed a higher blocking effect in mouse extensor digitorum longus muscles (IC = 46 nM), compared with µ-SIIIA, µ-SmIIIA and µ-PIIIA. µ-CnIIIC blocked Na(V)1.4 (IC(50) = 1.3 nM) and Na(V)1.2 channels in a long-lasting manner. Cardiac Na(V)1.5 and DRG-specific Na(V)1.8 channels were not blocked at 1 µM. µ-CnIIIC also blocked the α3β2 nAChR subtype (IC(50) = 450 nM) and, to a lesser extent, on the α7 and α4β2 subtypes. Structure determination of µ-CnIIIC revealed some similarities to α-conotoxins acting on nAChRs. µ-CnIIIC potently blocked VGSCs in skeletal muscle and nerve, and hence is applicable to myorelaxation. Its atypical pharmacological profile suggests some common structural features between VGSCs and nAChR channels.},

The Hamiltonians for the D and J interactions have the same functional form; thus, the experimentally measured apparent spin-spin coupling constant corresponds to a sum of J and D. In biomolecular NMR studies, it is commonly presumed that the dipolar contributions to Js are effectively canceled due to random molecular tumbling. However, in strong magnetic fields, such as those employed for NMR analysis, the tumbling of NA fragments is anisotropic because the inherent magnetic susceptibility of NAs causes an interaction with the external magnetic field. This motional anisotropy is responsible for non-zero D contributions to Js. Here, we calculated the field-induced D contributions to 33 structurally relevant scalar coupling constants as a function of magnetic field strength, temperature and NA fragment size. We identified two classes of Js, namely (1)JCH and (3)JHH couplings, whose quantitative interpretation is notably biased by NA motional anisotropy. For these couplings, the magnetic field-induced dipolar contributions were found to exceed the typical experimental error in J-coupling determinations by a factor of two or more and to produce considerable over- or under-estimations of the J coupling-related torsion angles, especially at magnetic field strengths >12 T and for NA fragments longer than 12 bp. We show that if the non-zero D contributions to J are not properly accounted for, they might cause structural artifacts/bias in NA studies that use solution NMR spectroscopy.},

Crystal structures have suggested that this process involves conformational changes in the transmembrane β-barrel of BamA that allow for lateral opening, as well as large overall rearrangements of its periplasmic POTRA domains. Here, we identify local dynamics of the BamA POTRA 5 domain by solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. The protein region undergoing conformational exchange is highly conserved and contains residues critical for interaction with BamD and correct β-barrel assembly in vivo. We show that mutations known to affect the latter processes influence the conformational equilibrium, suggesting that the plasticity of POTRA 5 is related to its interaction with BamD and possibly to substrate binding. Taken together, a view emerges in which local protein plasticity may be critically involved in the different stages of outer membrane protein folding and insertion.},

  abstract = {In nature, some proteins partially unfold under specific environmental conditions. These unfolded states typically consist of a large ensemble of conformations; their proper description is therefore a challenging problem. NMR spectroscopy is particularly well suited for this task: information on conformational preferences can be derived, for example, from chemical shifts or residual dipolar couplings. This information, which is measured as a time- and ensemble-average, can be used to model these states by generating large ensembles of conformations. The challenge is then to select a minimum representative set of conformations out of a large ensemble to represent the unfolded state. We have developed for this purpose an algorithm called MINOES (MINimum Optimal Ensemble Selection), which is based on an iterative procedure based on a driven expansion/contraction selection process. MINOES aims at selecting an optimal and minimal ensemble of conformations that, on average, maximizes the agreement between back-calculated and experimental (NMR) data, without any a-priori assumption about the required ensemble size. This approach is demonstrated by modeling the partially unfolded state of a deletion mutant of the Photoactive Yellow Protein, Delta25-PYP, which has been previously characterized by NMR (Bernard et al., Structure 2005;13:953-962).},

We found that this complex comprises a pseudo twofold symmetry axis and that the helix-hairpin-helix motif of ERCC1 is required for DNA binding, whereas the corresponding domain of XPF is functioning as a scaffold for complex formation with ERCC1. Despite the functional importance of heterodimerization, the C-terminal domain of XPF can also form homodimers in vitro. We here compare the stabilities of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes of the C-terminal domains of XPF and ERCC1. The higher stability of the XPF HhH complexes under various experimental conditions, determined using CD and NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, is well explained by the structural differences that exist between the HhH domains of the two complexes. The XPF HhH homodimer has a larger interaction interface, aromatic stacking interactions, and additional hydrogen bond contacts as compared to the XPF/ERCC1 HhH complex, which accounts for its higher stability.},

We have performed a detailed UV/vis spectroscopic study of the recovery of the signaling state of wild type (WT) PYP and two mutants, H108F and Δ25-PYP, derived from this protein, as a function of pH and the concentration of citric acid. This revealed that it is the dianionic form of citric acid that binds to the pB state of PYP. Its binding site is located in between the N-terminal cap and central β-sheet of PYP, which is accessible only in the signaling state of the protein. The obtained results show how changes in the distribution of subspecies of the signaling state of PYP influence the rate of ground state recovery.},

  abstract = {Chemical stimuli, generally constituted by small volatile organic molecules, are extremely important for the survival of different insect species. In the course of evolution, insects have developed very sophisticated biochemical systems for the binding and the delivery of specific semiochemicals to their cognate membrane-bound receptors. Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are a class of small soluble proteins present at high concentration in insect chemosensory organs; they are supposed to be involved in carrying the chemical messages from the environment to the chemosensory receptors. In this paper, we report on the solution structure of CSPsg4, a chemosensory protein from the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria, which is expressed in the antennae and other chemosensory organs. The 3D NMR structure revealed an overall fold consisting of six alpha-helices, spanning residues 13-18, 20-31, 40-54, 62-78, 80-90, and 97-103, connected by loops which in some cases show dihedral angles typical of beta-turns. As in the only other chemosensory protein whose structure has been solved so far, namely, CSP from the moth Mamestra brassicae, four helices are arranged to form a V-shaped motif; another helix runs across the two V's, and the last one is packed against the external face. Analysis of the tertiary structure evidenced multiple hydrophobic cavities which could be involved in ligand binding. In fact, incubation of the protein with a natural ligand, namely, oleamide, produced substantial changes to the NMR spectra, suggesting extensive conformational transitions upon ligand binding.},

In agreement with recent investigations on the N-glycosylation of phCG, produced in P. pastoris GS115, using ammonia/glycerol-methanol as nitrogen/carbon sources, the N-glycosylation pattern of phCG, synthesized using NH4Cl/glucose-glycerol-methanol, comprised neutral and charged, phosphorylated high-mannose-type N-glycans (Man8-15GlcNAc2). However, the changed culturing protocol led to much higher amounts of glycoprotein material, which is of importance for an economical realistic approach of the aimed NMR research. In the context of these studies, attention was also paid to the site specific N-glycosylation in phCG produced in P. pastoris GS115. In contrast to the rather simple N-glycosylation pattern of phCG expressed in the GS115 strain, phCG and phFSH expressed in the X-33 strain revealed, besides neutral high-mannose-type N-glycans, also high concentrations of neutral hypermannose-type N-glycans (Manup-to-30GlcNAc2). The latter finding made the X-33 strain not very suitable for generating 15N-labeled material. Therefore, 15N-phCG was expressed in the GS115 strain using the new optimized protocol. The 15N-enrichment was evaluated by 15N-HSQC NMR spectroscopy and GLC-EI/MS. Circular dichroism studies indicated that 15N-phCG/GS115 had the same folding as urinary hCG. Furthermore, 15N-phCG/GS115 was found to be similar to the unlabeled protein in every respect as judged by radioimmunoassay, radioreceptor assays, and in vitro bioassays.},

We therefore analyzed the NMR ensemble of 5UKE using structure validation tools and we compared 5UKE with homologous high-resolution X-ray structures. We identified several structural anomalies in 5UKE, including packing issues, frayed helices and improbable side chain conformations. We used Yasara to build a homology model, based on two high resolution death domain crystal structures, as an alternative model for the IRAK-M death domain (atomic coordinates, modeling details and validation are available at https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/service/5uke/).

These interactions are non-competitive and can occur simultaneously through distinct interaction surfaces. Interestingly, the XPA binding by ERCC1 and the catalytic function of XPF are dependent on a structurally homologous region of the two proteins.

  abstract = {The proteins Kid and Kis are the toxin and antitoxin, respectively, encoded by the parD operon of Escherichia coli plasmid R1. Kis prevents the inhibition of E. coli cell growth caused by the RNA cleavage activity of Kid. Overproduction of MazE, the chromosome-encoded homologue of Kis, has been demonstrated to neutralize Kid toxicity to a certain extent in the absence of native Kis. Here, we show that a high structural similarity exists between these antitoxins, using NMR spectroscopy. We report about the interactions between Kid and Kis that are responsible for neutralization of Kid toxicity and enhance autoregulation of parD transcription. Native macromolecular mass spectrometry data demonstrate that Kid and Kis form multiple complexes. At Kis:Kid ratios equal to or exceeding 1:1, as found in vivo in a plasmid-containing cell, various complexes are present, ranging from Kid(2)-Kis(2) tetramer up to Kis(2)-Kid(2)-Kis(2)-Kid(2)-Kis(2) decamer. When Kid is in excess of Kis, corresponding to an in vivo situation immediately after loss of the plasmid, the Kid(2)-Kis(2)-Kid(2) heterohexamer is the most abundant species. NMR chemical shift and intensity perturbations in the (1)H (15)N HSQC spectra of Kid and Kis, observed when titrating the partner protein, show that the interaction sites of Kid and Kis resemble those within the previously reported MazF(2)-MazE(2)-MazF(2) complex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Kid(2)-MazE(2) tetramers can be formed via weak interactions involving a limited part of the Kis-binding residues of Kid. The functional roles of the identified Kid-Kis and Kid-MazE interaction sites and complexes in toxin neutralization and repression of transcription are discussed.},

  abstract = {In problem-based learning, a tutor, the quality of the problems and group functioning play a central role in stimulating student learning. This study is conducted in a hybrid medical curriculum where problem-based learning is one of the pedagogical approaches. The aim of this study was to examine which tutor tasks are the most important during the tutorial sessions and thus should be promoted in hybrid (and in maybe all) problem-based learning curricula in higher education. A student (N = 333) questionnaire was used to obtain data about the problem-based learning process, combined with the achievement score of the students on a multiple-choice exam. Structural equation modeling was used to test the fit of different models (two existing models and a new simplified model) representing the factors of interest and their relationships, in order to determine which tutor characteristics are the most important in the present study. A new simplified model is presented, which demonstrates that stimulation of active and self-directed learning by tutors enhances the perceived case quality and the perceived group functioning. There was no significant effect between the stimulation of collaborative learning and perceived group functioning. In addition, group functioning was not a significant predictor for achievement. We found that stimulating active and self-directed learning are perceived as tutors' most important tasks with regard to perceived case quality and group functioning. It is necessary to train and teach tutors how they can stimulate active and self-directed learning by students.},

This provided mutants that, unlike WT enzyme, retained a large part of their activity after heating above 65 °C and cooling down. Here, we subjected the three best mutants along with the WT enzyme to biophysical and biochemical characterization. Combining thermal inactivation profiles, circular dichroism, X-ray structure analyses and NMR experiments revealed that mutations of surface amino acid residues counteract the tendency of Lipase A to undergo precipitation under thermal stress. Reduced precipitation of the unfolding intermediates rather than increased conformational stability of the evolved mutants seems to be responsible for the activity retention.},

This broadening involves amide protons found in the non-specific lac-DNA structure to be interacting with the DNA phosphate backbone, and can be ascribed to DNA sliding of the protein along the DNA. This NMR exchange broadening has been used to estimate the 1D diffusion constant for sliding along non-specific DNA. The observed 1D diffusion constant of 4×10(-12) cm(2)/s is two orders of magnitude smaller than derived from previous kinetic experiments, but falls in the range of values determined more recently using single molecule methods. This strongly supports the notion that sliding could play at most a minor role in the association kinetics of binding of lac repressor to lac operator and that other processes such as hopping and intersegment transfer contribute to facilitate the DNA recognition process.},

Histone chaperones are regulators of this process by preventing formation of non-nucleosomal histone-DNA complexes. Aprataxin and polynucleotide kinase like factor (APLF) is a non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair factor that possesses histone chaperone activity in its acidic domain (APLFAD). Here, we studied the molecular basis of this activity using biochemical and structural methods. We find that APLFAD is intrinsically disordered and binds histone complexes (H3-H4)2 and H2A-H2B specifically and with high affinity. APLFAD prevents unspecific complex formation between H2A-H2B and DNA in a chaperone assay, establishing for the first time its specific histone chaperone function for H2A-H2B. On the basis of a series of nuclear magnetic resonance studies, supported by mutational analysis, we show that the APLFAD histone binding domain uses two aromatic side chains to anchor to the α1-α2 patches on both H2A and H2B, thereby covering most of their DNA-interaction surface. An additional binding site on both APLFAD and H2A-H2B may be involved in the handoff between APLF and DNA or other chaperones. Together, our data support the view that APLF provides not only a scaffold but also generic histone chaperone activity for the NHEJ-complex.},

The importance of H-NS oligomerization is indicated by the fact that with an extended hns promoter construct (400 bp), which allows protein oligomerization, DNA binding and transcriptional repression are highly and almost equally efficient with native H-NS and H-NSctd::lambdaCI and much less effective with the monomeric H-NSctd. With a shorter (110 bp) construct, which does not sustain extensive protein oligomerization, transcriptional repression is less effective, but native H-NS, H-NSctd::lambdaCI, and monomeric H-NSctd have comparable activity on this construct. The specific H-NS-DNA interaction was investigated by NMR spectroscopy using monomeric H-NSctd and short DNA duplexes encompassing the H-NS target sequence of hns (TCCTTACATT) with the best fit (8 of 10 residues) to the H-NS-binding motif. H-NSctd binds specifically and with high affinity to the chosen duplexes via an overall electropositive surface involving four residues (Thr(109), Arg(113), Thr(114), and Ala(116)) belonging to the same protein loop and Glu(101). The DNA target is recognized by virtue of its sequence and of a TpA step that confers a structural irregularity to the B-DNA duplex.},

The E2/E3 complex Rad6/Rad18 exclusively monoubiquitinates the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to signal for "error prone" DNA damage tolerance, whereas a different set of conjugation enzymes is required for ubiquitin chain formation on PCNA. Here we show that human E2 enzyme Rad6b is intrinsically capable of catalyzing ubiquitin chain formation. This activity is prevented during PCNA ubiquitination by the interaction of Rad6 with E3 enzyme Rad18. Using NMR and X-ray crystallography we show that the R6BD of Rad18 inhibits this activity by competing with ubiquitin for a noncovalent "backside" binding site on Rad6. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how E3 enzymes can regulate the ubiquitin conjugation process.},

The role of the aromatic side chains Y21 and W104, which are in close vicinity to the FAD cofactor in the AppA BLUF domain from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, is investigated through the introduction of several amino acid substitutions at these positions. NMR spectroscopy indicated that in the W104F mutant, the local structure of the FAD binding pocket was not significantly perturbed as compared to that of the wild type. Time-resolved fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy was applied to explore the role of Y21 and W104 in AppA BLUF photochemistry. In the Y21 mutants, FADH*-W* radical pairs are transiently formed on a ps time scale and recombine to the ground state on a ns time scale. The W104F mutant shows a spectral evolution similar to that of wild type AppA but with an increased yield of signaling state formation. In the Y21F/W104F double mutant, all light-driven electron-transfer processes are abolished, and the FAD singlet excited-state evolves by intersystem crossing to the triplet state. Our results indicate that two competing light-driven electron-transfer pathways are available in BLUF domains: one productive pathway that involves electron transfer from the tyrosine, which leads to signaling state formation, and one nonproductive electron-transfer pathway from the tryptophan, which leads to deactivation and the effective lowering of the quantum yield of the signaling state formation. Our results are consistent with a photoactivation mechanism for BLUF domains where signaling state formation proceeds via light-driven electron and proton transfer from the conserved tyrosine to FAD, followed by a hydrogen-bond rearrangement and radical-pair recombination.},

In the EX1 limit, observed exchange rates become pH-independent and exclusively sensitive to local structure fluctuations that expose the amide proton HN to exchange. Close to this regime, we measured decay rates of individual backbone HN signals in D2O, and of their mutual HN-HN NOE by time-resolved two-dimensional (2D) NMR experiments. The data revealed correlated exchange at the center of the lac headpiece recognition helix, Val20-Val23, and suggested that the correlation breaks down at Val24, at the C terminus of the helix. A lower degree of correlation was observed for the exchange of Val9 and Ala10 at the center of helix 1, while no correlation was observed for Val38 and Glu39 at the center of helix 3. We conclude that HN exchange in the recognition helix and, to some extent, in helix 1 is a cooperative event involving the unfolding of these helices, whereas the HN exchange in helix 3 is dominated by random local structure fluctuations.},

Here, from transcriptomic/proteomic analyses of the Conus consors cone snail, we identified a new conopeptide called τ-CnVA, which displays the typical cysteine framework V of the T1-conotoxin superfamily. This peptide was chemically synthesized and its three-dimensional structure was solved by NMR analysis and compared to that of TxVA belonging to the same family, revealing very few common structural features apart a common orientation of the intercysteine loop. Because of the lack of a clear biological function associated with the T-conotoxin family, τ-CnVA was screened against more than fifty different ion channels and receptors, highlighting its capacity to interact selectively with the somatostatine sst3 receptor. Pharmacological and functional studies show that τ-CnVA displays a micromolar (Ki of 1.5μM) antagonist property for the sst3 receptor, being currently the only known toxin to interact with this GPCR subfamily.},

The integrity of river systems has been threatened in profound ways over the last century. Pollution, damming, canalisation, and water grabbing are some examples of pressures threatening the entwined lifeworlds of human and non-human communities that depend on riverine systems. Finding ways to reverse the trends of environmental degradation demands complex spatial-temporal, political, and institutional articulations across different levels of governance (from local to global) and among a plurality of actors who operate from diverse spheres of knowledge and systems of practice, and who have distinct capacities to affect decision-making. In this context, grassroots river initiatives worldwide use new multi-actor and multi-level dialogue arenas to develop proposals for river regeneration and promote social-ecological justice in opposition to dominant technocratic-hydraulic development strategies. This paper conceptualises these spaces of dialogue and action as RCAs and critically reflects on ways of organising and supporting RCAs while facilitating their cross-fertilisation in transdisciplinary practice. By integrating studies, debates, and theories from diverse disciplines, we generate multi-faceted insights and present cornerstones for the engagement with and/or enaction of RCAs. This encompasses five main themes central to RCAs: (1) River knowledge encounters and truth regimes, (2) transgressive co-learning, (3) confrontation and collaboration dynamics, (4) ongoing reflexivity, (5) transcultural knowledge assemblages and translocal bridging of rooted knowledge.},

A quantitative CS-RMSD score based on (1) H(α) ,(13) C(α) , and (15) N chemical shifts ranks the best solutions always at the top, as demonstrated on a small benchmark of four complexes. It is implemented in a new docking protocol, CS-HADDOCK, which combines CSP data as ambiguous interaction restraints in the sampling stage with the CS-RMSD score in the final scoring stage. This combination of qualitative and quantitative use of chemical shifts increases the reliability of data-driven docking for the structure determination of complexes from limited NMR data.},

As the enzyme is an amidase, it cleaves the NH-CO linkage between the Asn side chain and the Asn-bound GlcNAc residue. Usually, the enzyme has a low activity, or is not active at all, on native glycoproteins. A typical example is native bovine pancreatic ribonuclease B (RNase B) with oligomannose-type N-glycans at Asn-34. However, native RNase BS, generated by subtilisin digestion of native RNase B, which comprises amino acid residues 21-124 of RNase B, is sensitive to PNGase F digestion. The same holds for carboxymethylated RNase B (RNase B (cm)). In this study, NMR spectroscopy and molecular modeling have been used to explain the differences in PNGase F activity for native RNase B, native RNase BS, and RNase B (cm). NMR analysis combined with literature data clearly indicated that the N-glycan at Asn-34 is more mobile in RNase BS than in RNase B. MD simulations showed that the region around Asn-34 in RNase B is not very flexible, whereby the alpha-helix of the amino acid residues 1-20 has a stabilizing effect. In RNase BS, the alpha-helix formed by amino acid residues 23-32 is significantly more flexible. Using these data, the possibilities for complex formation of both RNase B and RNase BS with PNGase F were studied, and a model for the RNase BS-PNGase F complex is proposed.},

  abstract = {Proton resonance frequency shift (PRFS)-based MR thermometry (MRT) is hampered by heat-induced susceptibility changes when applied in tissues containing fat, e.g., the human breast. In order to assess the impact of fat susceptibility changes on PRFS-based MRT during thermal therapy in the human breast, reliable knowledge of the temperature dependence of the magnetic volume susceptibility of fat, dχ(fat)/dT, is a prerequisite. In this work we have measured dχ(fat)/dT of human breast fat tissue, using a double-reference method to ensure invariance to temperature-induced changes in the proton electron screening constant. Ex vivo measurements were taken on a 14.1 T five mm narrow bore NMR spectrometer. Breast fat tissue samples were collected from six subjects, directly postmortem. The susceptibility was measured over a temperature range from 24°C to 65°C. A linear behavior of the susceptibility over temperature was observed for all samples. The resulting dχ(fat)/dT of human breast fat ranged between 0.0039 and 0.0076 ppm/°C. It is concluded that the impact of heat-induced susceptibility changes of fat during thermal therapy in the breast may not be neglected.},

RING domains are involved in specific interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and thus play an essential role in the ubiquitination pathway. Protein production of the Zn(2+) containing and cysteine rich RING domains for molecular studies frequently turns out to be problematic. We compared the expression and solubility of 14 E3 RING/U-box domains fused to the N-terminal tags of His(6), His(6)-GB1, His(6)-Trx and His(6)-GST at small scale and analyzed, by NMR spectroscopy, their correct folding after purification. The addition of GST, Trx or GB1 to the N-terminal His(6) tag significantly improved both the expression and solubility of target proteins as compared to His(6) tag alone. More importantly most of the immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) purified proteins were largely unfolded as judged by analysis of the (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectra. We demonstrate that imidazole causes a concentration dependent decrease in stability of RING proteins ascribed to metal depletion and resulting in unfolding or precipitation. In contrast, using glutathione affinity chromatography, the His(6)-GST fused RING and U-box domains were purified as correctly folded proteins with high yields. Our data clearly demonstrate that IMAC should be avoided and that GST-fusion affinity chromatography is generally applicable for expression and purification of Zn(2+) containing proteins.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional domain swapping is a common phenomenon in pancreatic-like ribonucleases. In the aggregated state, these proteins acquire new biological functions, including selective cytotoxicity against tumour cells. RNase A is able to dislocate both N- and C-termini, but usually this process requires denaturing conditions. In contrast, bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS-RNase), which is a homo-dimeric protein sharing 80% of sequence identity with RNase A, occurs natively as a mixture of swapped and unswapped isoforms. The presence of two disulfides bridging the subunits, indeed, ensures a dimeric structure also to the unswapped molecule. In vitro, the two BS-RNase isoforms interconvert under physiological conditions. Since the tendency to swap is often related to the instability of the monomeric proteins, in these paper we have analysed in detail the stability in solution of the monomeric derivative of BS-RNase (mBS) by a combination of NMR studies and Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The refinement of NMR structure and relaxation data indicate a close similarity with RNase A, without any evidence of aggregation or partial opening. The high compactness of mBS structure is confirmed also by H/D exchange, urea denaturation, and TEMPOL mapping of the protein surface. The present extensive structural and dynamic investigation of (monomeric) mBS did not show any experimental evidence that could explain the known differences in swapping between BS-RNase and RNase A. Hence, we conclude that the swapping in BS-RNase must be influenced by the distinct features of the dimers, suggesting a prominent role for the interchain disulfide bridges.},

The effect is conserved for both the human and Drosophila proteins. Mutated Axin forms nonamyloid nanometer-scale aggregates decorated with disordered tentacles, which 'rewire' the Axin interactome. Importantly, the tumor-suppressor activity of both the human and Drosophila Axin cancer mutants is rescued by preventing aggregation of a single nonconserved segment. Our findings establish a new paradigm for misregulation of signaling in cancer and show that targeting aggregation-prone stretches in mutated scaffolds holds attractive potential for cancer treatment.},

It consists of a regulatory region containing a cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain and a catalytic region that activates Rap. In the absence of cAMP, access of Rap to the catalytic site is blocked by the regulatory region. We analyzed the conformational states of the CNB domain in the absence and in the presence of cAMP and cAMP analogues by NMR spectroscopy, resulting in the first direct insights into the activation mechanism of Epac. We prove that the CNB domain exists in equilibrium between the inactive and the active conformation, which is shifted by binding of cAMP. cAMP binding results in conformational changes in both the ligand binding pocket and the outer helical segments. We used two different cAMP antagonists that block these successive changes to elucidate the steps of this process. Highlighting the role of dynamics, the superactivator 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP induces similar conformational changes as cAMP but causes different internal mobility. The results reveal the critical elements of the CNB domain of Epac required for activation and highlight the role of dynamics in this process.},

HADDOCK uses non-structural experimental data to drive the docking during a rigid-body energy minimization, and semi-flexible and water refinement stages. The latter allow for flexibility of all DNA nucleotides and the residues of the protein at the predicted interface. We evaluated our approach on the monomeric repressor-DNA complexes formed by bacteriophage 434 Cro, the Escherichia coli Lac headpiece and bacteriophage P22 Arc. Starting from unbound proteins and canonical B-DNA we correctly predict the correct spatial disposition of the complexes and the specific conformation of the DNA in the published complexes. This information is subsequently used to generate a library of pre-bent and twisted DNA structures that served as input for a second docking round. The resulting top ranking solutions exhibit high similarity to the published complexes in terms of root mean square deviations, intermolecular contacts and DNA conformation. Our two-stage docking method is thus able to successfully predict protein-DNA complexes from unbound constituents using non-structural experimental data to drive the docking.},

The toxin Kid inhibits cell growth by RNA degradation and its action is neutralized by the formation of a tight complex with the antitoxin Kis. A fascinating but poorly understood aspect of the kid-kis system is its autoregulation at the transcriptional level. Using macromolecular (tandem) mass spectrometry and DNA binding assays, we here demonstrate that Kis pilots the interaction of the Kid-Kis complex in the parD regulatory region and that two discrete Kis-binding regions are present on parD. The data clearly show that only when the Kis concentration equals or exceeds the Kid concentration a strong cooperative effect exists between strong DNA binding and Kid2-Kis2-Kid2-Kis2 complex formation. We propose a model in which transcriptional repression of the parD operon is tuned by the relative molar ratio of the antitoxin and toxin proteins in solution. When the concentration of the toxin exceeds that of the antitoxin tight Kid2-Kis2-Kid2 complexes are formed, which only neutralize the lethal activity of Kid. Upon increasing the Kis concentration, (Kid2-Kis2)n complexes repress the kid-kis operon.},

However, under stress conditions, the GTP concentration may decline by as much as 50%, and that of ppGpp can attain levels comparable to those of GTP. Here we show that IF2 binds ppGpp at the same nucleotide-binding site and with similar affinity as GTP. Thus, GTP and the alarmone ppGpp can be considered two alternative physiologically relevant IF2 ligands. ppGpp interferes with IF2-dependent initiation complex formation, severely inhibits initiation dipeptide formation, and blocks the initiation step of translation. Our data suggest that IF2 has the properties of a cellular metabolic sensor and regulator that oscillates between an active GTP-bound form under conditions allowing active protein syntheses and an inactive ppGpp-bound form when shortage of nutrients would be detrimental, if not accompanied by slackening of this synthesis.},

In the last two cases, a part of the protein is affected either by binding or unfolding and the detection of the respective perturbed and unperturbed region(s) is a fundamental part of the structural characterization of these states. This can be achieved by comparing experimental data of the same protein in two different states (bound/unbound, folded/unfolded). For instance, measurements of chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) from NMR 1H-15N HSQC experiments gives an excellent opportunity to discriminate both moieties. We describe an innovative, automatic and unbiased method to distinguish perturbed and unperturbed regions in a protein existing in two distinct states (folded/partially unfolded, bound/unbound). The SAMPLEX program takes as input a set of data and the corresponding three-dimensional structure and returns the confidence for each residue to be in a perturbed or unperturbed state. Its performance is demonstrated for different applications including the prediction of disordered regions in partially unfolded proteins and of interacting regions in protein complexes. The proposed approach is suitable for partially unfolded states of proteins, local perturbations due to small ligands and protein-protein interfaces. The method is not restricted to NMR data, but is generic and can be applied to a wide variety of information.},

His proposal of the radical pair mechanism was the birth of the field of spin chemistry, and the laser CIDNP NMR experiment on a protein was a major breakthrough in hyperpolarisation research. He set milestones for biomolecular NMR by developing computational methods for protein structure determination, including restrained molecular dynamics and 3D NMR methodology. With a lac repressor headpiece, he determined one of the first protein structures determined by NMR. His studies of the lac repressor provided the first examples of detailed studies of protein nucleic acid complexes by NMR. This deepened our understanding of protein DNA recognition and led to a molecular model for protein sliding along the DNA. Furthermore, he played a leading role in establishing the cluster of NMR large-scale facilities in Europe.

This protein represents the first component of a new allergen family, which has no 3D structure available yet. Here, we report the first experimental data on the 3D-structure of Peamaclein. Almost 75% of the backbone resonances, including two helical stretches in the N-terminal region, and four out of six cysteine pairs have been assigned by 2D-NMR using a natural protein sample. Simulated gastrointestinal digestion experiments have highlighted that Peamaclein is even more resistant to digestion than the peach major allergen Pru p 3. Only the heat-denatured protein becomes sensitive to intestinal proteases. Similar to Pru p 3, Peamaclein keeps its native 3D-structure up to 90°C, but it becomes unfolded at temperatures of 100-120°C. Heat denaturation affects the immunological properties of both peach allergens, which lose at least partially their IgE-binding epitopes. In conclusion, the data collected in this study provide a first set of information on the molecular properties of Peamaclein. Future studies could lead to the possible use of the denatured form of this protein as a vaccine, and of the inclusion of cooked peach in the diet of subjects allergic to Peamaclein.},

NarE belongs to the family of ADP-ribosyltransferases (ADPRT) and catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose moieties to arginine residues in target protein acceptors. Many pathogenic bacteria utilize ADP-ribosylating toxins to modify and alter essential functions of eukaryotic cells. NarE is further the first ADPRT which could be shown to bind iron through a Fe-S center, which is crucial for the catalytic activity. Here we present the NMR solution structure of NarE, which shows structural homology to other ADPRTs. Using NMR titration experiments we could identify from Chemical Shift Perturbation data both the NAD binding site, which is in perfect agreement with a consensus sequence analysis between different ADPRTs, as well as the iron coordination site, which consists of 2 cysteines and 2 histidines. This atypical iron coordination is also capable to bind zinc. These results could be fortified by site-directed mutagenesis of the catalytic region, which identified two functionally crucial residues. We could further identify a main interaction region of NarE with antibodies using two complementary methods based on antibody immobilization, proteolytic digestion, and mass spectrometry. This study combines structural and functional features of NarE providing for the first time a characterization of an iron-dependent ADPRT.},

  abstract = {NarE is a 16 kDa protein identified from Neisseria meningitidis, one of the bacterial pathogens responsible for meningitis. NarE belongs to the ADP-ribosyltransferase family and catalyses the transfer of ADP-ribose moieties to arginine residues in target protein acceptors. Many pathogenic bacteria utilize ADP-ribosylating toxins to modify and alter essential functions of eukaryotic cells. NarE was proposed to bind iron through a Fe-S center which is supposed to be implied in catalysis. We have produced and purified uniformly labeled (15)N- and (15)N/(13)C-NarE and assigned backbone and side-chain resonances using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. These assignments provide the starting point for the three-dimensional structure determination of NarE and the characterization of the role of the Fe-S center in the catalytic mechanism.},

Recently published crystal structures of AppA WT and the AppA mutant C20S describe contradictory conclusions regarding the orientation of the conserved glutamine 63 side chain in the dark. Here, we present evidence from NMR spectroscopy confirming light-induced flipping of the glutamine side chain to form a strong hydrogen bond between the glutamine 63 side chain carbonyl group and the tyrosine 21 side chain hydroxyl proton in the light-induced state. Our conclusions are consistent with published data from UV/vis absorbance and FTIR spectroscopy, as well as the crystal structure of AppA WT.},

Readers for these modifications are only partially overlapping, and some readers, such as Rfx proteins, display strong specificity. Interactions are dynamic during differentiation, as for example evidenced by the mESC-specific binding of Klf4 to mC and the NPC-specific binding of Uhrf2 to hmC, suggesting specific biological roles for mC and hmC.

Since the precise composition of collagen hydrolysates is generally unknown, it is of interest to analyze samples containing various collagen fragments with appropriate biophysical methods. Any product optimization without a profound knowledge concerning the size and the molecular weight distribution of its components is nearly impossible. It turned out that a combination of AFM methods with NMR techniques is exceptionally suited to examine the size range and the aggregation behavior of the collagen fragments in the hydrolysates of fish, jellyfish, chicken, porcine and bovine collagen. Supported by molecular modeling calculations, the AFM and NMR experiments provide a detailed knowledge about the composition of collagen hydrolysates and collagen ointments. Furthermore, the data allow a correlation between the size of the fragments and their potential bioactivity.},

  abstract = {Target controlled infusion (TCI) is a clinically-available and widely-used computer-controlled method of drug administration, adjusting the drug titration towards user selected plasma- or effect-site concentrations, calculated according to pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models. Although this technology is clinically available for several anaesthetic drugs, the contemporary commercialised PKPD models suffer from multiple limitations. First, PKPD models for anaesthetic drugs are developed using deliberately selected patient populations, often excluding the more challenging populations, such as children, obese or elderly patients, of whom the body composition or elimination mechanisms may be structurally different compared to the lean adult patient population. Separate PKPD models have been developed for some of these subcategories, but the availability of multiple PKPD models for a single drug increases the risk for invalid model selection by the user. Second, some models are restricted to the prediction of plasma-concentration without enabling effect-site controlled TCI or they identify the effect-site equilibration rate constant using methods other than PKPD modelling. Advances in computing and the emergence of globally collected databases has allowed the development of new "general purpose" PKPD models. These take on the challenging task of identifying the relationships between patient covariates (age, weight, sex, etc) and the volumes and clearances of multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic models applicable across broad populations from neonates to the elderly, from the underweight to the obese. These models address the issues of allometric scaling of body weight and size, body composition, sex differences, changes with advanced age, and for young children, changes with maturation and growth. General purpose models for propofol, remifentanil and dexmedetomidine have appeared and these greatly reduce the risk of invalid model selection. In this narrative review, we discuss the development, characteristics and validation of several described general purpose PKPD models for anaesthetic drugs.},

In 163 patients, propofol was administered using a CL system (BIS target [BISTARGET] between 40 and 50). Initial CeREMI targets between 2 and 7.5 ng/mL were selected as deemed clinically required. Performance parameters during induction were the time required to initially cross the target BIS, the time required to reach the maximal drug effect after induction (TPEAK, BIS) and the corresponding BIS at this moment, and the time required to regain the target BIS at the end of induction. Performance during maintenance was defined as the percentage of case time with target BIS ± 10 from target and the amount of performance error (PE) between the observed and target BIS values and its derived median PE (MDPE) as a measure of control bias, median absolute PE (MDAPE) as a measure of control inaccuracy, divergence as a measure of the time-related trend of the measured BIS values relative to the target BIS values, and wobble as a measure of intrasubject variability in prediction error. The secondary end point was the hemodynamic stability of the patient during CL control. The applied CL system induced and maintained anesthesia within clinically accepted ranges. The percentage of case time [mean (standard deviation [SD]) across all study participants] with BIS ± 10 from the target was 82% (14%). The mean (SD) population MDPE and MDAPE were -6.6% (5.5%) and 11.2% (5.5%), respectively. A negative divergence [-0.001 (0.004)] and acceptable wobble [9.7% (4.0%)] were found. The correlation between the system PE and CeREMI was low and only influenced by a CeREMI <2.8 ng/mL. Hemodynamic stability stayed within the clinically acceptable range. The applied CL system for propofol administration has an acceptable performance in the CeREMI range of 2.8-7.5 ng/mL during the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. There was no evidence of a strong association between CeREM and the CL performance. This study also shows that when the CeREMI is <2.8 ng/mL, it might be more challenging to prevent arousal during propofol anesthesia.},

Published rocuronium PK/PD models overestimated clinically registered TOF ratios. The models of Wierda, Szenohradszky, Cooper, Alvarez-Gomez and McCoy showed significant predictive consistency between themselves, displaying Median Absolute Performance Errors between 38% and 41%, and intra-individual differences (Wobble) between 14 and 15%.

We trained four machine learning models to predict sedation levels and evaluated the influence of remifentanil, age, and sex on the prediction performance. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the prediction model. The ensemble tree with bagging outperformed other machine learning models and predicted sedation levels with an AUC = 0.88 (0.81-0.90). There were significant differences in the prediction probability of the automated systems when trained and tested across different age groups and sex. The performance of the EEG based sedation level prediction system is drug, sex, and age specific.

Using deep learning algorithms, we developed a novel data-repurposing framework to predict hypnotic levels from sleep brain rhythms. We used an online large sleep data set (5723 clinical EEGs) for training the deep learning algorithm and a clinical trial hypnotic data set (30 EEGs) for testing during dexmedetomidine infusion. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). The deep learning model (a combination of a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory units) trained on sleep EEG predicted deep hypnotic level with an accuracy (95% confidence interval [CI]) = 81 (79.2-88.3)%, AUC (95% CI) = 0.89 (0.82-0.94) using dexmedetomidine as a prototype drug. We also demonstrate that EEG patterns during dexmedetomidine-induced deep hypnotic level are homologous to nonrapid eye movement stage 3 EEG sleep. We propose a novel method to develop hypnotic level monitors using large sleep EEG data, deep learning, and a data-repurposing approach, and for optimizing such a system for monitoring any given individual.

The study quantified the relationship between the remimazolam concentration, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (MOAAS) score, and bispectral index (BIS) using TCI. The authors performed a three-period, crossover, dose-ranging clinical trial in 24 healthy volunteers using age and sex stratification. Data collected in the first period, where remimazolam was administered alone using a step-up and step-down TCI protocol, were used for this analysis. Remimazolam concentrations, MOAAS scores, and BIS values were collected at each step at steady state. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling methodology. The relationship between remimazolam, BIS, and MOAAS differed between step-up and step-down infusions at similar remimazolam target concentrations. Tolerance, driven by remimazolam or CNS7054, significantly improved overall model fit (P < 0.01) for both BIS and MOAAS models. After 30 min of repeated bolus dosing, mimicking the regimen in the label for procedural sedation, the BIS and probability of MOAAS 2/3 were predicted to be 54 (95% prediction interval, 44 to 67) and 2% (95% prediction interval, 0 to 32%) versus 58 (95% prediction interval, 48 to 70) and 8% (95% prediction interval, 0 to 36%) in a model without and with tolerance, respectively. After 60 min of continuous infusion, mimicking the regimen in the label for general anesthesia, the BIS and probability of MOAAS 0 were predicted to be 40 (95% prediction interval, 33 to 50) and 87% (95% prediction interval, 18 to 100%) versus 50 (95% prediction interval, 41 to 60) and 59% (95% prediction interval, 6 to 99%) in a model without and with tolerance, respectively. In this study, it was shown that remimazolam-induced sedation is prone to tolerance development, which is potentially mediated by the CNS7054 concentration.

Using large-scale EEG recordings and machine learning techniques, we investigated whether dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation indeed mimics natural sleep patterns. We used EEG recordings from three sources in this study: 8,707 overnight sleep EEG and 30 dexmedetomidine clinical trial EEG. Dexmedetomidine-induced sedation levels were assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We extracted 22 spectral features from each EEG recording using a multitaper spectral estimation method. Elastic-net regularization method was used for feature selection. We compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest), trained on individual sleep stages, to predict different levels of the MOAA/S sedation state. The random forest algorithm trained on non-rapid eye movement stage 3 (N3) predicted dexmedetomidine-induced deep sedation (MOAA/S = 0) with area under the receiver operator characteristics curve >0.8 outperforming other machine learning models.

  abstract = {In this in-silico study, we investigate the clinical utility of target-controlled infusion for antibiotic dosing in an intensive care unit setting using vancomycin as a model compound. We compared target-controlled infusion and adaptive target-controlled infusion, which combines target-controlled infusion with data from therapeutic drug monitoring, with conventional (therapeutic drug monitoring-based) vancomycin dosing strategies. A clinical trial simulation was conducted. This simulation was based on a comprehensive database of clinical records of intensive care unit patients and a systematic review of currently available population-pharmacokinetic models for vancomycin in intensive care unit patients. Dosing strategies were compared in terms of the probability of achieving efficacious concentrations as well as the potential for inducing toxicity. Adaptive target-controlled infusion outperforms rule-based dosing guidelines for vancomycin. In the first 48 h of treatment, the probability of target attainment is significantly higher for adaptive target-controlled infusion than for the second-best method (Cristallini). Probability of target attainments of 54 and 72% and 47 and 59% for both methods after 24 and 48 h, respectively. Compared to the Cristallini method, which is characterized by a probability of attaining concentrations above 30 mg.L Our study shows that adaptive target-controlled infusion has the potential to become a practical tool for patient-tailored antibiotic dosing in the intensive care unit.},

This article reports on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of pediatric patients aged 6 to 18 yr and a subsequent model-based optimization of the used dosing regimen. Thirty-one patients were included in the trial and stratified across four treatment arms: bolus administration, infusion, bolus plus fentanyl, or infusion plus fentanyl. The University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, Michigan) Sedation Scale (UMSS) was used to assess the depth of sedation. Blood samples were drawn to measure the concentrations of remimazolam and its metabolite CNS7054. Population pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling was performed in NONMEM (GloboMax LLC, USA). A population pharmacokinetic model was developed for remimazolam and CNS7054. The elimination clearance of remimazolam was 0.70 l · min -1 · 70 kg -1 . A proportional odds model combined with a simplified Minto model described the observed UMSS well. The EC50 of remimazolam for a UMSS score of 3 or greater was 777 ng · ml -1 in the absence of fentanyl, and decreased to 655, 533, and 287 ng/ml for concomitant fentanyl steady state concentrations of 1, 2, or 4 ng · ml -1 , respectively. Simulations confirmed that the studied dosing regimen resulted in 9.2 to 22.0% of patients not reaching a UMSS score of 3 or greater at the end of the induction. Model-based optimization resulted in higher per-kilogram dosages and the removal of the maximum allowable dose. Simulations indicated that the percentage of patients achieving a UMSS score of 3 or greater can be expected to be high (88 to 97%). This study has shown that the pharmacokinetics of remimazolam are likely different between children 6 yr or older and adults (after correcting for size). In addition, the exposure-response relationship shows that to effectively use remimazolam for procedural sedation in children 6 yr or older, the dosing regimen should be modified to allow for higher remimazolam exposures.},

The initial view of inhaled anesthetics as indispensable for general anesthesia has evolved during the years and, currently, its general use has even been questioned. Beyond the traditional risks inherent to any drug in use, inhaled anesthetics are exceptionally strong greenhouse gases (GHG) and may pose considerable occupational risks. This emphasizes the importance of evaluating and considering its use in clinical practices. Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence of worsening climate changes, control measures are very slowly implemented. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all society sectors, including the health sector to maximally decrease GHG emissions where possible. Within the field of anesthesia, the potential to reduce GHG emissions can be briefly summarized as follows: Stop or avoid the use of nitrous oxide (N},

This is a reanalysis of previously published data. Volunteers received four anesthesia sessions, each with different drug combinations of propofol or sevoflurane, with or without remifentanil. Nonlinear mixed effects modeling was used to study the relationship between drug concentrations, clinical endpoints, and Patient State Index-1 and Patient State Index-2. The C50 values for no response to calling the person by name, tolerance to shake and shout, and tolerance to tetanic stimulation for propofol (µg · ml) and sevoflurane (vol %; relative standard error [%]) were 1.62 (7.00)/0.64 (4.20), 1.85 (6.20)/0.90 (5.00), and 2.82 (15.5)/0.91 (10.0), respectively. The C50 values for Patient State Index-1 and Patient State Index-2 were 1.63 µg · ml (3.7) and 1.22 vol % (3.1) for propofol and sevoflurane. Only for sevoflurane was a significant difference found in the pharmacodynamic model for Patient State Index-2 compared with Patient State Index-1. The pharmacodynamic models for Patient State Index-1 and Patient State Index-2 as a predictor for no response to calling the person by name, tolerance to shake and shout, and tetanic stimulation were indistinguishable, with Patient State Index50 values for propofol and sevoflurane of 46.7 (5.1)/68 (3.0), 41.5 (4.1)/59.2 (3.6), and 29.5 (12.9)/61.1 (8.1), respectively. Post hoc C50 values for propofol and sevoflurane were perfectly correlated (correlation coefficient = 1) for no response to calling the person by name and tolerance to shake and shout. Post hoc C50 and Patient State Index50 values for propofol and sevoflurane for tolerance to tetanic stimulation were independent within an individual (correlation coefficient = 0). The pharmacodynamics of propofol and sevoflurane were described on both population and individual levels using a clinical score and the Patient State Index. Patient State Index-2 has an improved performance at higher sevoflurane concentrations, and the relationship to probability of responsiveness depends on the drug used but is unaffected for Patient State Index-1 and Patient State Index-2.},

Relation between these sources should be time independent, that is, perfectly synchronized. In reality, various issues corrupt time independency, leading to asynchrony or, in other words, hysteresis. This asynchrony can lead to conflicting information, making effective drug dosing challenging. In this study, we tried to quantify and minimize the hysteresis between the Ceprop (calculated using the Schnider model for propofol) and EEG measured drug effect, using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM). Further, we measured the influence of EEG-based monitor choice, namely Bispectral index (BIS) versus qCON index (qCON) monitor, on propofol PD hysteresis. We analyzed the PD data from 165 patients undergoing propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for outpatient surgery. Drugs were administered using target-controlled infusion (TCI) pumps. Pumps were programmed with Schnider model for propofol and Minto model for remifentanil. We constructed 2 PD models (direct models) relating the Schnider Ceprop to the measured BIS and qCON monitor values. We quantified the models' misspecification due to hysteresis, on an individual level, using the root mean squared errors (RMSEs). Subsequently, we optimized the PD models' predictions by adding a lag term to both models (lag-time PD models) and quantified the optimization using the RMSE. There is a counterclockwise hysteresis between Ceprop and BIS/qCON values. Not accounting for this hysteresis results in a direct PD model with an effect-site concentration which produces 50% of the maximal drug effect (Ce50) of 6.24 and 8.62 µg/mL and RMSE (median and interquartile range [IQR]) of 9.38 (7.92-11.23) and 8.41(7.04-10.2) for BIS and qCON, respectively. Adding a modeled lag factor of 49 seconds to the BIS model and 53 seconds to the qCON model improved both models' prediction, resulting in similar Ce50 (3.66 and 3.62 µg/mL for BIS and qCON) and lower RMSE (median (IQR) of 7.87 (6.49-9.90) and 6.56 (5.28-8.57) for BIS and qCON. There is a significant "Ceprop versus EEG measured drug effect" hysteresis. Not accounting for it leads to conflicting PD information and false high Ce50 for propofol in both monitors. Adding a lag term improved the PD model performance, improved the "pump-monitor" synchrony, and made the estimates of Ce50 for propofol more realistic and less monitor dependent.},

Technological advancement has made autonomous systems, also known as robots, an integral part of our life in several fields, including medicine. The application of robots in anesthesia could be classified into 3 types of robots. The first ones are pharmacological robots. These robots are based on closed-loop systems that allow better-individualized anesthetic drug titration for optimal homeostasis during general anesthesia and sedation. Recent evidence also demonstrates that autonomous systems could control hemodynamic parameters proficiently outperforming manual control in the operating room. The second type of robot is mechanical. They enable automated motorized reproduction of tasks requiring high manual dexterity level. Such robots have been advocated to be more accurate than humans and, thus, could be safer for the patient. The third type is a cognitive robot also known as decision support system. This type of robot is able to recognize crucial clinical situation that requires human intervention. When these events occur, the system notifies the attending clinician, describes relevant related clinical observations, proposes pertinent therapeutic options and, when allowed by the attending clinician, may even administer treatment. It seems that cognitive robots could increase patients' safety. Robots in anesthesia offer not only the possibility to free the attending clinicians from repetitive tasks but can also reduce mental workload allowing them to focus on tasks that require human intelligence such as analytical and clinical approach, lifesaving decision-making capacity, and interpersonal interaction. Nevertheless, further studies have yet to be done to test the combination of these 3 types of robots to maintain simultaneously the homeostasis of multiple biological variables and to test the safety of such combination on a large-scale population.},

In the development of those single-drug models, postnatal age (PNA), postmenstrual age (PMA), total body weight (TBW), height, and serum creatinine (SCR) were tested as covariates. Subsequently, a combined population PK model was established and the correlations between the PK of PIP and TAZ were tested. Monte Carlo simulations were performed based on the final combined model to evaluate the current dosing recommendations. The final combined model for PIP/TAZ consisted of four compartments (two for each drug), with covariates including TBW, PMA, and SCR. For a 70-kg, 35-year-old patient with SCR of 0.83 mg L We developed a combined population PK model for PIP/TAZ across a broad range of patients covering the extremes of patient characteristics. This model can be used as a robust a priori model for Bayesian forecasting to achieve individualised dosing. The simulations indicate that adjustments based on the allometric theory as well as maturation and decline of CL of PIP may help the current dosing recommendations to provide consistent target attainment across patient populations.},

A three-period, crossover, dose-ranging clinical trial was performed in 24 healthy volunteers. In all periods, remimazolam was administered using a step-up and step-down target controlled infusion protocol (50 to 2,000 ng/ml). Stable remifentanil target concentrations of 0.5 ng/ml and 0.1 to 4.0 ng/ml were maintained in periods 2 and 3, respectively. Remifentanil, remimazolam, and CNS7054 (metabolite) concentrations and MOAAS, BIS, TOL, and TOTS were collected in each step of the target controlled infusion protocol. Data were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects models, where P ≤ 0.01 was considered significant. Remifentanil reduced the apparent clearance of CNS7054 with a half-maximum inhibition at 8.0 ng/ml (95% CI, 5.5 to 13.4 ng/ml). A pharmacodynamic interaction was detected on all endpoints. Simulations indicate that the probability of observing a MOAAS 2 or 3 is highest at remimazolam target concentration of 275, 250, or 200 ng/ml combined with 0, 0.1, or 0.5 ng/ml remifentanil resulting in probabilities of 45%, 45%, and 44%, respectively.

A pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction between remimazolam and remifentanil was quantified in this clinical trial.

In this research, we aimed to define the different phases of the process and develop an overarching model that can help detect and correct potential error sources, improve clinical reasoning and optimize patient care. We conducted a focused ethnography study utilizing non-participant video observations of real-life EMS deployments combined with thematic analysis of peer interviews. After an initial qualitative analysis of 7 video observations, we formulated a tentative conceptual model of the EMS care process. To test and refine this model, we carried out a qualitative, thematic analysis of 28 video-recorded cases. We validated the resulting model by evaluating its recognizability with a peer content analysis utilizing semi-structured interviews. Based on real-life observations, we were able to define and validate a model covering the distinct phases of an EMS deployment. We have introduced the acronym "SPART" to describe ten different phases: Start, Situation, Prologue, Presentation, Anamnesis, Assessment, Reasoning, Resolution, Treatment, and Transfer. The "SPART" model describes the EMS care process and helps to understand it. We expect it to facilitate identifying and addressing factors that influence both the care process and the clinical reasoning task embedded in this process.},

  abstract = {Numerous pharmacokinetic models have been published aiming at more accurate and safer dosing of dexmedetomidine. The vast majority of the developed models underpredict the measured plasma concentrations with respect to the target concentration, especially at plasma concentrations higher than those used in the original studies. The aim of this article was to develop a dexmedetomidine pharmacokinetic model in healthy adults emphasizing linear versus nonlinear kinetics. The data of two previously published clinical trials with stepwise increasing dexmedetomidine target-controlled infusion were pooled to build a pharmacokinetic model using the NONMEM software package (ICON Development Solutions, USA). Data from 48 healthy subjects, included in a stratified manner, were utilized to build the model. A three-compartment mamillary model with nonlinear elimination from the central compartment was superior to a model assuming linear pharmacokinetics. Covariates included in the final model were age, sex, and total body weight. Cardiac output did not explain between-subject or within-subject variability in dexmedetomidine clearance. The results of a simulation study based on the final model showed that at concentrations up to 2 ng · ml-1, the predicted dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations were similar between the currently available Hannivoort model assuming linear pharmacokinetics and the nonlinear model developed in this study. At higher simulated plasma concentrations, exposure increased nonlinearly with target concentration due to the decreasing dexmedetomidine clearance with increasing plasma concentrations. Simulations also show that currently approved dosing regimens in the intensive care unit may potentially lead to higher-than-expected dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations. This study developed a nonlinear three-compartment pharmacokinetic model that accurately described dexmedetomidine plasma concentrations. Dexmedetomidine may be safely administered up to target-controlled infusion targets under 2 ng · ml-1 using the Hannivoort model, which assumed linear pharmacokinetics. Consideration should be taken during long-term administration and during an initial loading dose when following the dosing strategies of the current guidelines.},

  abstract = {Dexmedetomidine is a sedative with modest analgesic efficacy, whereas remifentanil is an opioid analgesic with modest sedative potency. Synergy is often observed when sedative-hypnotics are combined with opioid analgesics in anesthetic practice. A three-phase crossover trial was conducted to study the pharmacodynamic interaction between remifentanil and dexmedetomidine. After institutional review board approval, 30 age- and sex- stratified healthy volunteers were studied. The subjects received consecutive stepwise increasing target-controlled infusions of dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, and remifentanil with a fixed dexmedetomidine background concentration. Drug effects were measured using binary (yes or no) endpoints: no response to calling the subject by name, tolerance of shaking the patient while shouting the name ("shake and shout"), tolerance of deep trapezius squeeze, and tolerance of laryngoscopy. The drug effect was measured using the electroencephalogram-derived "Patient State Index." Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling related the administered dexmedetomidine and remifentanil concentration to these observed effects. The binary endpoints were correlated with dexmedetomidine concentrations, with increasing concentrations required for increasing stimulus intensity. Estimated model parameters for the dexmedetomidine EC50 were 2.1 [90% CI, 1.6 to 2.8], 9.2 [6.8 to 13], 24 [16 to 35], and 35 [23 to 56] ng/ml, respectively. Age was inversely correlated with dexmedetomidine EC50 for all four stimuli. Adding remifentanil did not increase the probability of tolerance of any of the stimuli. The cerebral drug effect as measured by the Patient State Index was best described by the Hierarchical interaction model with an estimated dexmedetomidine EC50 of 0.49 [0.20 to 0.99] ng/ml and remifentanil EC50 of 1.6 [0.87 to 2.7] ng/ml. Low dexmedetomidine concentrations (EC50 of 0.49 ng/ml) are required to induce sedation as measured by the Patient State Index. Sensitivity to dexmedetomidine increases with age. Despite falling asleep, the majority of subjects remained arousable by calling the subject's name, "shake and shout," or a trapezius squeeze, even when reaching supraclinical concentrations. Adding remifentanil does not alter the likelihood of response to graded stimuli.},

The purpose of this investigation was to develop a PK-PD model for remimazolam and perform covariate analysis to maximise its utility across broad, diverse populations and to evaluate its consistency with clinical observations of drug dosing. Arterial and venous concentrations of remimazolam and its metabolite, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score and bispectral index were determined in 20 studies. Final population models were developed with covariate analysis. Simulations of drug administration for sedation and anaesthesia for this and previously published models were compared with the results of clinical studies. Model development proceeded from 933 individuals aged 6-93 yr and weight 21-171 kg. PK data from studies with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and treatment in ICU were considered in a post hoc analysis. Simulations of target-controlled infusion with the final model targeting sedation (Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation score 2 or 3) or anaesthesia (bispectral index 50) showed drug administration declining with age consistent with clinical observations. A PK-PD model for remimazolam was developed for a broad, diverse population.

We hypothesised that integration of multiple QEEG features into a single sedation-level estimator using a machine learning algorithm could reliably predict levels of sedation, independent of the sedative drug used. In total, 102 subjects receiving propofol (N=36; 16 male/20 female), sevoflurane (N=36; 16 male/20 female), or dexmedetomidine (N=30; 15 male/15 female) were included in this study of healthy volunteers. Sedation level was assessed using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score. We used 44 QEEG features estimated from the EEG data in a logistic regression algorithm, and an elastic-net regularisation method was used for feature selection. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess the performance of the logistic regression model. The performances obtained when the system was trained and tested as drug-dependent mode to distinguish between awake and sedated states (mean AUC [standard deviation]) were propofol=0.97 (0.03), sevoflurane=0.74 (0.25), and dexmedetomidine=0.77 (0.10). The drug-independent system resulted in mean AUC=0.83 (0.17) to discriminate between the awake and sedated states. The incorporation of large numbers of QEEG features and machine learning algorithms is feasible for next-generation monitors of sedation level. Different QEEG features were selected for propofol, sevoflurane, and dexmedetomidine groups, but the sedation-level estimator maintained a high performance for predicting MOAA/S independent of the drug used.

A temporal spatial analysis of Utstein data was performed for all adult patients with a non-traumatic OHCA attended by three emergency medical services (EMS) covering the north of the Netherlands during a one-year period. Patients were considered potentially eligible for ECPR if they had a witnessed arrest with immediate bystander CPR, an initial shockable rhythm (or signs of life during resuscitation) and could be presented in an ECPR-centre within 45 minutes of the arrest. Endpoint of interest was defined as the hypothetical number of ECPR eligible patients after 10, 15 and 20 minutes of conventional CPR and upon (hypothetical) arrival in an ECPR-centre as a fraction of the total number of OHCA patients attended by EMS. During the study period 622 OHCA patients were attended, of which 200 (32%) met ECPR eligibility criteria upon EMS arrival. The optimal transition point between conventional CPR and ECPR was found to be after 15 minutes. Hypothetical intra-arrest transport of all patients in whom no return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was obtained after that point (n = 84) would have yielded 16/622 (2.5%) patients being potentially ECPR eligible upon hospital arrival (average low-flow time 52 minutes), whereas on-scene initiation of ECPR would have resulted in 84/622 (13.5%) potential candidates (average estimated low-flow time 24 minutes before cannulation). Even in healthcare systems with relatively short transport distances to hospital, consideration should be given to pre-hospital initiation of ECPR for OHCA as it shortens low-flow time and increases the number of potentially eligible patients.},

For anesthesia and sedation, most of these models are derived from narrow patient populations, which restricts applicability for the overall population, including (small) children, elderly, and obese patients. This forces clinicians to select specific models for specific populations. Recently, general purpose models have been developed for propofol and remifentanil using data from multiple studies and broad, diverse patient groups. General-purpose models might reduce the risks associated with extrapolation, incorrect usage, and unfamiliarity with a specific TCI-model, as they offer less restrictive boundaries (i.e., the patient "doesn't fit in the selected model") compared with the earlier, simpler models. Extrapolation of a model can lead to delayed recovery or inadequate anesthesia. If multiple models for the same drug are implemented in the pump, it is possible to select the wrong model for that specific case; this can be overcome with one general purpose model implemented in the pump. This article examines the usability of these general-purpose models in relation to the more traditional models.},

The present overview aims to describe the current role of the 2 most frequently used monitoring methods for evaluation brain function in the perioperative period, ie, electroencephalography (EEG) and brain oxygenation monitoring. Available evidence suggests that EEG-derived parameters give additional information about depth of anesthesia for optimizing anesthetic titration. The effects on reduction of drug consumption or recovery time are heterogeneous, but most studies show a reduction of recovery times if anesthesia is titrated along processed EEG. It has been hypothesized that future EEG-derived indices will allow a better understanding of the neurophysiological principles of anesthetic-induced alteration of consciousness instead of the probabilistic approach most often used nowadays.Brain oxygenation can be either measured directly in brain parenchyma via a surgical burr hole, estimated from the venous outflow of the brain via a catheter in the jugular bulb, or assessed noninvasively by near-infrared spectroscopy. The latter method has increasingly been accepted clinically due to its ease of use and increasing evidence that near-infrared spectroscopy-derived cerebral oxygen saturation levels are associated with neurological and/or general perioperative complications and increased mortality. Furthermore, a goal-directed strategy aiming to avoid cerebral desaturations might help to reduce these complications. Recent evidence points out that this technology may additionally be used to assess autoregulation of cerebral blood flow and thereby help to titrate arterial blood pressure to the individual needs and for bedside diagnosis of disturbed autoregulation.},

Twenty-one patients treated with cefepime according to the standard of care were included. Cefepime was administered through continuous infusion using TCI for a median duration of 4.5 days.

To evaluate the measured versus predicted plasma concentrations, blood samples were taken (median of 10 samples per patient), and total cefepime concentrations were measured using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

  abstract = {Propofol and remifentanil are frequently combined for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. Both propofol and remifentanil cause vasodilation and potentially reduce arterial BP. We aimed to develop a mechanism-based model that characterises the haemodynamic interactions between remifentanil and propofol. Data from two clinical trials in healthy volunteers were analysed using remifentanil-alone, propofol-alone, and combination groups. We evaluated remifentanil effects on haemodynamics using a previously developed mechanism-based haemodynamic model of propofol. The interaction between propofol and remifentanil was explored using the principles of the general pharmacodynamic interaction (GPDI) model. Remifentanil alone increased the dissipation rate of total peripheral resistance by 50% at 3.0 ng ml The structure of the previous mechanism-based haemodynamic model for propofol was able to describe the effects of remifentanil alone on haemodynamic variables. The GPDI model provided a good framework for characterising the pharmacodynamic interaction between remifentanil and propofol on haemodynamic properties. NCT02043938; NCT03143972.},

  abstract = {Cyclopropyl-methoxycarbonyl metomidate, or ABP-700, is a second generation analogue of etomidate, developed to retain etomidate's beneficial haemodynamic and respiratory profile but diminishing its suppression of the adrenocortical axis. The objective of this study was to characterise the safety and efficacy of 30-min continuous infusions of ABP-700, and to assess its effect on haemodynamics and the adrenocortical response in healthy human volunteers. Five cohorts involving 40 subjects received increasing infusion doses of ABP-700, propofol 60 μg kg No serious AEs were reported. Haemodynamic and respiratory effects included mild dose-dependent tachycardia, slightly elevated blood pressure, and no centrally mediated apnoea. Upon stimulation with ACTH, no adrenocortical depression was observed in any subject. Involuntary muscle movements (IMM) were reported, which were more extensive with higher dosing regimens. Higher dosages of ABP-700 were associated with deeper sedation and increased likelihood of sedation. Time to onset of clinical effect was variable throughout the cohorts and recovery was swift. Infusions of ABP-700 showed a dose-dependent hypnotic effect, and did not cause severe hypotension, severe respiratory depression, or adrenocortical suppression. The presentation and nature of IMM is a matter of concern. NTR4735.},

In the present study of isolated rat lungs, clearances of labeled (3HOH) and unlabeled water were compared after instillation of hypotonic or hypertonic solutions into the air spaces or injection of a hypotonic bolus into the pulmonary artery. The clearance of 3HOH between the air spaces and perfusate after intratracheal instillation and from the vasculature to the tissues after pulmonary arterial injections was invariably greater than that of unlabeled water, indicating that osmotically driven transport of water is limited by permeability of the tissue barriers rather than the rate of perfusion. Exposure to 0.5 mM HgCl2 in the perfusate and air-space solution reduced the product of the filtration coefficient and surface area (PfS) of water from the air spaces to the perfusate by 28% after instillation of water into the trachea. In contrast, perfusion of 0.5 mM HgCl2 in air-filled lungs reduced PfS of the endothelium by 86% after injections into the pulmonary artery, suggesting that much of the action of this inhibitor is on the endothelial surfaces. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that aquaporin-1 is on mouse pulmonary endothelium. No aquaporin-1 was found on alveolar type I cells with immunogold transmission electron microscopy, but small amounts were present on some type II cells.},

We combine this new technique with our mathematical models of pulmonary vascular morphology to quantify structural and functional attributes of lung arterial trees. Our physiological studies require repeated measurements of vascular structure to determine differences in vessel biomechanical properties between animal models of pulmonary disease. Automation provides many advantages including significantly improved speed and minimized operator interaction and biasing. The results are validated by comparison with previously published rat pulmonary arterial micro-CT data analysis techniques, in which vessels were manually mapped and measured using intense operator intervention.},

Following plasma miR-sequencing (seq) in a transwomen discovery (n = 20) and validation cohort (n = 30), we identified miR-224 and miR-452. Subsequent systemic silencing of these miRs in male C57Bl/6 J mice (n = 10) was followed by RNA-seq-based gene expression analysis of brown and white adipose tissue in conjunction with mechanistic studies in cultured adipocytes. Estradiol in transwomen lowered plasma miR-224 and -452 carried in extracellular vesicles (EVs) while their systemic silencing in mice and cultured adipocytes increased lipogenesis (white adipose) but reduced glucose uptake and mitochondrial respiration (brown adipose). In white and brown adipose tissue, differentially expressed (miR target) genes are associated with lipogenesis (white adipose) and mitochondrial respiration and glucose uptake (brown adipose). This study identified an estradiol-drive post-transcriptional network that could potentially offer a mechanistic understanding of metabolism following gender-affirming estradiol therapy.},

  abstract = {Animals respond to environmental variation by changing their movement in a multifaceted way. Recent advancements in biologging increasingly allow for detailed measurements of the multifaceted nature of movement, from descriptors of animal movement trajectories (e.g., using GPS) to descriptors of body part movements (e.g., using tri-axial accelerometers). Because this multivariate richness of movement data complicates inference on the environmental influence on animal movement, studies generally use simplified movement descriptors in statistical analyses. However, doing so limits the inference on the environmental influence on movement, as this requires that the multivariate richness of movement data can be fully considered in an analysis. We propose a data-driven analytic framework, based on existing methods, to quantify the environmental influence on animal movement that can accommodate the multifaceted nature of animal movement. Instead of fitting a simplified movement descriptor to a suite of environmental variables, our proposed framework centres on predicting an environmental variable from the full set of multivariate movement data. The measure of fit of this prediction is taken to be the metric that quantifies how much of the environmental variation relates to the multivariate variation in animal movement. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework through a case study about the influence of grass availability and time since milking on cow movements using machine learning algorithms. We show that on a one-hour timescale 37% of the variation in grass availability and 33% of time since milking influenced cow movements. Grass availability mostly influenced the cows' neck movement during grazing, while time since milking mostly influenced the movement through the landscape and the shared variation of accelerometer and GPS data (e.g., activity patterns). Furthermore, this framework proved to be insensitive to spurious correlations between environmental variables in quantifying the influence on animal movement. Not only is our proposed framework well-suited to study the environmental influence on animal movement; we argue that it can also be applied in any field that uses multivariate biologging data, e.g., animal physiology, to study the relationships between animals and their environment. },

The primary endpoint was freedom from AF recurrence at 12-month follow-up after a 90-day blanking period. Ancillary objectives include safety, procedural efficiency, and quality of life (QoL). The QoL assessment using the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on QualiTy-of-Life (AFEQT) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) Score of AF-related symptoms was collected at baseline and 12 months. In total, 1054 patients were included in this analysis (age 60.6, 67.6% male, 26.5% PersAF). Kaplan-Meier estimate of freedom from AF recurrence was 77.7% at 12 months. Peri-procedural device or procedure-related complications were observed in 26 (2.5%) patients, with a low stroke rate of 0.3%. One-year post-ablation, the EHRA AF Symptom score decreased in 68% of patients. The AFEQT score improvement was observed in 88.4% and 90.4% of patients who completed the questionnaire in-person or interviewed by phone at 12 month follow-up, respectively. Phased RF ablation for the treatment of paroxysmal and persistent AF demonstrated a 77.7% freedom from AF recurrence at 12 months in addition to a significant reduction in arrhythmia symptoms and clinically meaningful improved QoL. Low peri-procedural complication rate of <3% was reported.},

This raises several questions, especially concerning the frequency of performing gender-affirming treatments with irreversible effects and regret from such interventions. To study the current prevalence of gender dysphoria, how frequently gender-affirming treatments are performed, and the number of people experiencing regret of this treatment. The medical files of all people who attended our gender identity clinic from 1972 to 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. The number of (and change in) people who applied for transgender health care, the percentage of people starting with gender-affirming hormonal treatment (HT), the estimated prevalence of transgender people receiving gender-affirming treatment, the percentage of people who underwent gonadectomy, and the percentage of people who regretted gonadectomy, specified separately for each year. 6,793 people (4,432 birth-assigned male, 2,361 birth-assigned female) visited our gender identity clinic from 1972 through 2015. The number of people assessed per year increased 20-fold from 34 in 1980 to 686 in 2015. The estimated prevalence in the Netherlands in 2015 was 1:3,800 for men (transwomen) and 1:5,200 for women (transmen). The percentage of people who started HT within 5 years after the 1st visit decreased over time, with almost 90% in 1980 to 65% in 2010. The percentage of people who underwent gonadectomy within 5 years after starting HT remained stable over time (74.7% of transwomen and 83.8% of transmen). Only 0.6% of transwomen and 0.3% of transmen who underwent gonadectomy were identified as experiencing regret. Because the transgender population is growing, a larger availability of transgender health care is needed. Other health care providers should familiarize themselves with transgender health care, because HT can influence diseases and interact with medication. Because not all people apply for the classic treatment approach, special attention should be given to those who choose less common forms of treatment. This study was performed in the largest Dutch gender identity clinic, which treats more than 95% of the transgender population in the Netherlands. Because of the retrospective design, some data could be missing. The number of people with gender identity issues seeking professional help increased dramatically in recent decades.

However, it is still unknown whether survival rates of short-stem hips match current standards. We made a systematic summary of reported overall survival after short-stem total hip arthroplasty. We conducted a systematic review of English, French, German, and Dutch literature. 2 assessors independently identified clinical studies on short-stem hip arthroplasty. After recalculating reported revision rates, we determined whether each implant had a projected revision rate of 10% or less at 10 years of follow-up or a revision rate per 100 observed component years of 1 or less. Stems were classified as "collum", "partial collum", or "trochanter-sparing". We found 49 studies, or 51 cohorts, involving 19 different stems. There was a large increase in recent publications. The majority of studies included had a follow-up of less than 5 years. We found a large number of observational studies on "partial collum" and "trochanter-sparing" stems, demonstrating adequate survival rates at medium-term follow-up. Clinical evidence from "collum stem" studies was limited to a small number of studies with a medium-term follow-up period. These studies did not show a satisfactory overall survival rate.},

Gender-affirming hormonal treatment was initiated at the first visit. In trans men, serum hematocrit (Hct) levels increased during the first year (+4.9 Hct %, 95% CI 3.82-5.25), with the most pronounced increase during the first 3 months (+2.7 Hct %, 95% CI 1.94-3.29).

Of 192 trans men, 22 (11.5%) developed serum hematocrit levels ≥50.0%. Trans men on testosterone undecanoate were less likely to develop hematocrit levels ≥50% or ≥52%, compared to trans men on testosterone esters, and were less likely to develop hematocrit levels ≥50%, compared to trans men on testosterone gel. In trans women, serum hematocrit had dropped by 4.1 Hct % (95% CI 3.50-4.37) after 3 months, after which only small decreases were observed. In conclusion, serum hematocrit levels can be found in the reference range of the perceived gender as from 3 months after the initiation of gender-affirming hormonal treatment.},

Additional disturbances seem to exist in their sense of body ownership. However, the factors underlying this disturbance in body ownership remain elusive. Knowledge of these factors, and increased understanding of how body ownership is related to other abnormalities seen in schizophrenia, could ultimately advance development of new treatments. Research on body ownership in schizophrenia has mainly been investigated with the rubber hand illusion (RHI). Schizophrenia patients show higher susceptibility to the RHI, which may be explained by a stronger reliance on multisensory information over weaker stored body representations. This review shows that a coherent sense of body ownership arises from the integration of both bottom-up sensory processes and higher order, top-down bodily- and perceptual representations. Multisensory integration, temporal binding, anticipation, intention and efferent signals all partly modulate the complex experience of body ownership. Specifically, we propose that patients with schizophrenia have weaker stored body representations, and rely to a greater extent on external stimuli, such as visual information, due to imprecise or highly variable internal predictions. Moreover, the reduced sense of agency in schizophrenia may additionally contribute to the disturbed sense of body ownership, as evidence from healthy participants suggests that agency and body ownership are interrelated. Vice versa, a reduced sense of body ownership may also contribute to a reduced sense of agency. Future studies should explicitly target the precise relationship between the two in schizophrenia.},

Staff (N = 1271) completed an online survey concerning burnout symptoms (subscale Emotional Exhaustion of the Maslach Burnout Inventory), exposure to challenging behaviours and a range of potential psychological resources. We examined main and moderating effects with multilevel analyses. In order to control for the multiple comparisons, P values corrected for false discovery rate (P We found a direct relation between exposure to challenging behaviours and increased levels of burnout symptoms in staff (b = .15, t(670) = 4.466, P Of the psychological resources found to be associated with reduced risk of burnout symptoms, staff self-efficacy and access of staff to supervisor social support seem to be the factors that can be influenced best. These factors thus may be of importance in reducing the risk of developing burnout symptoms and improving staff well-being, even though the current study was not designed to demonstrate causal relations between psychological resources and burnout symptoms.},

The co-primary endpoints were Total Urgency Frequency Score (TUFS) and total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). HRQoL was assessed by several secondary endpoints: IPSS QoL index, overactive bladder questionnaire (OAB-q), and Patient Global Impression (PGI) scale. The correlation between symptom improvement (TUFS) and HRQoL was assessed by Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Single and double responder analyses, using subjective and objective measures, were also performed. In the responder analyses, men treated with a FDC of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS consistently had significantly improved outcomes compared with placebo (8/8 responder analyses performed) and TOCAS (6/8 responder analyses performed). There was a significant correlation (P < 0.001) between the reduction in TUFS and the improvement in HRQoL defined by IPSS QoL score, OAB-q symptom bother score, PGI overall bladder symptoms and PGI general health. In men with LUTS/BPH who have moderate-to-severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms, the reduction in symptoms with a once-daily FDC of solifenacin and TOCAS was associated with consistent patient-relevant improvements in HRQoL compared with placebo and TOCAS monotherapy.},

Senescence is a complex and heterogeneous process linked to fibrosis and cancer, but the exact mechanism and relevant markers can be cell-type dependent. Therefore, many markers of senescence have been proposed, and many methods to detect senescence have been developed.

Draft items were developed following 44 semi-structured concept elicitation interviews in the UK and refined using 36 cognitive interviews. A pilot study was designed to assess the draft ICIQ-UAB's initial psychometric properties with 54 patients recruited from European hospitals. Further concept elicitation interviews were also carried out with 11 patients in the US and 10 patients in Japan. All participants had a prior urodynamic diagnosis of detrusor underactivity. The cognitive interviews confirmed the initial items to be understood and interpreted as intended. Pilot testing showed that both internal consistency (Cronbach's α ≥ 0.85) and test-retest reliability (stable patients; intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.88) were high. The interviews in the US and Japan elicited symptoms and impacts that support previous findings in the UK and provided further insight into the experiences of patients in those countries. The developmental ICIQ-UAB was refined using the evidence from all substudies. The validity and reliability of the ICIQ-UAB were supported in a pilot study setting and the wider cultural applicability by the additional interviews in the US and Japan. Following further validation in future clinical trials, the developmental ICIQ-UAB is envisaged as an important tool for the monitoring of future UAB treatment strategies.},

Microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, have been shown to play a role in the development of radiation-induced neurotoxicity. However, their molecular and hence functional response to proton irradiation remains unknown. This study investigates the effect of protons on microglia by comparing the effect of photons and protons as well as the influence of age and different irradiated volumes. Rats were irradiated with 14 Gy to the whole brain with photons (X-rays), plateau protons, spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) protons or to 50 % anterior, or 50 % posterior brain sub-volumes with plateau protons. RNA sequencing, validation of microglial priming gene expression using qPCR and high-content imaging analysis of microglial morphology were performed in the cortex at 12 weeks post irradiation. Photons and plateau protons induced a shared transcriptomic response associated with neuroinflammation. This response was associated with a similar microglial priming gene expression signature and distribution of microglial morphologies. Expression of the priming gene signature was less pronounced in juvenile rats compared to adults and slightly increased in rats irradiated with SOBP protons. High-precision partial brain irradiation with protons induced a local microglial priming response and morphological changes. Overall, our data indicate that the brain responds in a similar manner to photons and plateau protons with a shared local upregulation of microglial priming-associated genes, potentially enhancing the immune response to subsequent inflammatory challenges.},

Cross-sex hormone therapy in transgender persons leads to changes in body weight and body composition, but it is unclear to what extent. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the changes in body weight, body fat and lean body mass during cross-sex hormone therapy in transgender persons. We searched the PubMed database for eligible studies until November 2015. Ten studies reporting changes in body weight, body fat or lean mass in hormone naive transgender persons were included, examining 171 male-to-female and 354 female-to-male transgender people. Pooled effect estimates in the male-to-female group were +1.8 kg (95% CI: 0.2;3.4) for body weight, +3.0 kg (2.0;3.9) for body fat and -2.4 kg (-2.8; -2.1) for lean body mass. In the female-to-male group, body weight changed with +1.7 kg (0.7;2.7), body fat with -2.6 kg (-3.9; -1.4) and lean body mass with +3.9 kg (3.2;4.5). Cross-sex hormone therapy increases body weight in both sexes. In the male-to-female group, a gain in body fat and a decline in lean body mass are observed, while the opposite effects are seen in the female-to-male group. Possibly, these changes increase the risk of cardiometabolic disease in the male-to-female group.},

To investigate breast development in transwomen during their first year of CHT and whether clinical or laboratory parameters predict breast development. This study was performed as part of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence, which is a prospective multicenter cohort study. Gender clinics in Amsterdam, Ghent, and Florence. Transwomen who completed the first year of CHT (n = 229). CHT. Breast development in centimeter and cup size. The median age of the included transwomen was 28 years (range, 18 to 69). Mean breast-chest difference increased to 7.9 ± 3.1 cm after 1 year of CHT, mainly resulting in less than an AAA cup size (48.7%). Main breast development occurred in the first 6 months of therapy. Serum estradiol levels did not predict breast development after 1 year of CHT (first quartile, 3.6 cm [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.7 to 4.5], second quartile, 3.2 cm [95% CI, 2.3 to 4.2], third quartile, 4.4 cm [95% CI, 3.5 to 5.3], and fourth quartile, 3.6 cm [95% CI, 2.7 to 4.5]). This study shows that, after 1 year of CHT, breast development is modest and occurs primarily in the first 6 months. No clinical or laboratory parameters were found that predict breast development.},

  abstract = {The left atrial appendage (LAA) is the main source of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation without valvular disease. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) has proven effective for preventing strokes associated with atrial fibrillation but is complicated by inherent bleeding risk and therapeutic compliance. Mechanical closure of the left atrial appendage seems an attractive alternative, especially in patients for whom long-term oral anticoagulation is not a good option. In the past decade, several percutaneous techniques have become available for this, including the WATCHMAN device. Randomized trials with the WATCHMAN device suggest that closure of the left atrial appendage is not inferior to oral anticoagulation in stroke prevention and that additionally there is reduced bleeding. Prospective registry studies of patients with contraindications for oral anticoagulation confirm that closure of the left atrial appendage is an attractive alternative to anticoagulation. Ongoing investigations are focused on reducing complications of the closure procedure, the lowest form of anticoagulation, comparing existing techniques and comparing left atrial appendage closure with direct oral anticoagulants.},

Unfavorable changes in lipid profile were observed in transmen; a favorable effect was noted in transwomen. HT effects on BP were negligible. Long-term studies are warranted to assess whether and to what extent HT in trans individuals results in a differential effect on cardiovascular disease outcomes.},

Our aim was to investigate changes in visceral fat and the ratio of visceral fat to total body fat (VAT/TBF) and their associations with changes in lipids and insulin resistance after 1 year of hormone therapy in trans persons. In 179 trans women and 162 trans men, changes in total body and visceral fat estimated with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after 1 year of hormone therapy were related to lipids and insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)] with linear regression analysis. In trans women, total body fat increased by 4.0 kg (95% CI 3.4, 4.7), while the amount of visceral fat did not change (-2 grams; 95% CI -15, 11), albeit with a large range from -318 to 281, resulting in a decrease in the VAT/TBF ratio of 17% (95% CI 15, 19). In trans men, total body fat decreased with 2.8 kg (95% CI 2.2, 3.5), while the amount of visceral fat did not change (3 g; 95% CI -10, 16; range -372, 311), increasing the VAT/TBF ratio by 14% (95% CI 10, 17). In both groups, VAT/TBF was not associated with changes in blood lipids or HOMA-IR. Hormone therapy in trans women and trans men resulted in changes in VAT/TBF, mainly due to changes in total body fat and were unrelated to changes in cardiometabolic risk factors, which suggests that any unfavorable cardiometabolic effects of hormone therapy are not mediated by changes in visceral fat or VAT/TBF.},

An electronic search was conducted using the databases Medline, Eric, PsychINFO and Cinahl. Studies with experimental or quasi-experimental designs were included. We performed an overall random-effect meta-analysis and subgroup analyses. We found a significant moderate overall effect of non-pharmacological interventions on challenging behaviours (d = 0.573, 95% CI [0.352-0.795]), and this effect appears to be longlasting. Interventions combining mindfulness and behavioural techniques showed to be more effective than other interventions. However, this result should be interpreted with care due to possible overestimation of the subgroup analysis. No differences in effectiveness were found across assessment times, delivery modes or study designs. Non-pharmacological interventions appear to be moderately effective on the short and long term in reducing challenging behaviours in adults with intellectual disabilities.},

This research provides an in-depth case study of MAB implementation in South Africa using the Cape Winelands Biosphere Reserve (CWBR), established in 2007 when a key MAB guiding policy, the Madrid Action Plan came into effect. The study utilized semi-structured in-depth interviews with strategic and operational management, and document analysis. The CWBR prioritizes their role as a landscape coordinator, a driver of socio-economic development and site in which humans derive benefits from healthy natural environments. The CWBR have adopted a non-profit organization cooperative governance model in support of this vision, fulfilling the socio-economic development function primarily through successful international partnerships. Challenges faced include a perceived lack of sufficient government support, limited stakeholder awareness and insufficient resources for project implementation. Over reliance on the pillar of their model, the chief executive officer in the current governance form, is an instrument in their effectiveness, yet carries significant risk. These are learnings useful for other biosphere reserves translating an international designation for a local context.},

  abstract = {The term lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompasses a range of urinary symptoms, including storage symptoms (e.g. overactive bladder [OAB]) as well as voiding and post-micturition symptoms. Although treatment of male LUTS tends to focus on voiding symptoms, patients typically find storage symptoms the most bothersome. The core storage symptom is urgency, which drives the other main storage symptoms of increased daytime frequency, nocturia and incontinence. Although several validated questionnaires have been widely used to study urgency, few measure the two important storage parameters, urgency and frequency, in a single assessment. The total urgency and frequency score (TUFS) is a new validated tool that captures both variables and is derived from the Patient Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale, which has been validated in patients with OAB and LUTS. The TUFS was first validated in OAB in the phase IIa BLOSSOM study, which was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of mirabegron, a β3 -adrenoceptor agonist, in 260 patients. The responsiveness of the TUFS to treatment has been confirmed in a further three large-scale randomized controlled trials of solifenacin in patients with OAB or LUTS. Changes in TUFS from baseline to end of treatment were consistent with changes in micturition diary variables in all four studies. Furthermore, the TUFS was significantly correlated with several health-related quality-of-life variables in the phase III NEPTUNE study. Thus, the TUFS appears to be useful for assessing improvements in major storage symptoms (urgency and frequency) in clinical trials.},

The aim of this study was to investigate in a prospective observational multicenter study the first-year effects of CHT on BMD in transgender persons. A total of 231 transwomen and 199 transmen were included who completed the first year of CHT. Transwomen were treated with cyproterone acetate and oral or transdermal estradiol; transmen received transdermal or intramuscular testosterone. A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was performed to measure lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH), and femoral neck (FN) BMD before and after 1 year of CHT. In transwomen, an increase in LS (+3.67%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.20 to 4.13%, p < 0.001), TH (+0.97%, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.31%, p < 0.001), and FN (+1.86%, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.31%, p < 0.001) BMD was found. In transmen, TH BMD increased after 1 year of CHT (+1.04%, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.44%, p < 0.001). No changes were observed in FN BMD (-0.46%, 95% CI -1.07 to 0.16%, p = 0.144). The increase in LS BMD was larger in transmen aged ≥50 years (+4.32%, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.36%, p = 0.001) compared with transmen aged <50 years (+0.68%, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.17%, p = 0.007). In conclusion, BMD increased in transgender persons after 1 year of CHT. In transmen of postmenopausal age, the LS BMD increased more than in younger transmen, which may lead to the hypothesis that the increase in BMD in transmen is the result of the aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

Patients were randomised to placebo, TOCAS 0.4 mg, FDC solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS 0.4 mg, or FDC solifenacin 9 mg plus TOCAS 0.4 mg. Primary efficacy end points were (1) total IPSS and (2) Total Urgency and Frequency Score (TUFS). An FDC met the success criteria if it demonstrated superiority compared with placebo and noninferiority compared with TOCAS for total IPSS, as well as superiority compared with TOCAS for TUFS. Reductions in total IPSS and TUFS were observed with both solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS (-7.0 and -8.1, respectively) and solifenacin 9 mg plus TOCAS (-6.5 and -7.6, respectively) compared with TOCAS (-6.2 and -6.7, respectively) and placebo (-5.4 and -4.4, respectively). Solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS met all prespecified success criteria for both primary end points, while solifenacin 9 mg plus TOCAS met success criteria compared with placebo but not compared with TOCAS. Both FDCs improved quality of life (QoL) measures and were well tolerated, with low incidences of acute urinary retention. The FDC of solifenacin 6 mg plus TOCAS significantly improved storage and voiding symptoms, as well as QoL parameters, compared with placebo. This FDC also improved storage symptoms and QoL compared with TOCAS alone in men with moderate to severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms, and it was well tolerated.},

Test-retest reliability, presence of floor/ceiling effects, responsiveness to change, known-group validity, and concurrent validity were assessed for each score. A total of 901 patients had at least one valid PPIUS assessment after baseline. TUFS demonstrated good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.8), discriminated between groups defined based on International Prostate Symptom Score storage score severity (known-groups validity), had high concurrent validity, and had high responsiveness to change (Guyatt's responsiveness statistic 0.88), with an absence of floor or ceiling effects. The psychometric properties of other PPIUS-derived scores were not as consistently robust and showed either low-to-moderate responsiveness, presence of a floor or ceiling effect, or low-to-moderate test-retest reliability. This study shows that the PPIUS is reliable and valid in patients with LUTS associated with BPH.

This research is also part of the initial qualitative phase for the development of a new patient reported outcome measure for the assessment of UAB. Qualitative methods were used to understand the experience of UAB from a patient perspective, in a purposive sample of male (n=29) and female (n=15) patients aged 27-88 yr (mean: 64 yr), diagnosed with a primary diagnosis of detrusor underactivity, with or without coexisting urological conditions. Semistructured interviews were conducted in Bristol, UK. Male and female patients reported a variety of lower urinary tract symptoms and associated impact on quality of life. Storage symptoms of nocturia, increased daytime frequency, and urgency, and the voiding symptoms of slow stream, hesitancy, and straining were reported by over half of the patients. A sensation of incomplete emptying and postmicturition dribble were also frequently described. Most had a post void residual >30ml (n=34, 77%, median: 199ml) with many reporting urinary tract infections, a history of self-catheterisation, and some experiencing occasional acute retention episodes. These symptoms and signs can have a broad impact on quality of life including having to plan their daily activities around the location of toilets, disruption to sleep, social life, and associated effect on family and friends. Knowledge of the lived experience of UAB obtained in the current study will be used for the development of a new patient reported outcome measure and help inform the current working definition of UAB. The symptoms, signs, and impact on quality of life of underactive bladder are described by patients with the condition.},

Understanding how the human brain responds to cancer and its treatment is essential to improve the associated cognitive sequelae. In this study, we performed integrated transcriptomic and tissue analysis on postmortem normal-appearing non-tumor brain tissue from glioblastoma (GBM) patients that had received cancer treatments, region-matched brain tissue from unaffected control individuals and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We show that normal-appearing non-tumor brain regions of patients with GBM display hallmarks of accelerated aging, in particular mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and proteostasis deregulation. The extent and spatial pattern of this response decreased with distance from the tumor. Gene set enrichment analyses and a direct comparative analysis with an independent cohort of brain tissue samples from AD patients revealed a significant overlap in differentially expressed genes and a similar biological aging trajectory. Additionally, these responses were validated at the protein level showing the presence of increased lysosomal lipofuscin, phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein Tau, and oxidative DNA damage in normal-appearing brain areas of GBM patients. Overall, our data show that the brain of GBM patients undergoes accelerated aging and shared AD-like features, providing the basis for novel or repurposed therapeutic targets for managing brain tumor-related side effects.},

  abstract = {The cause of prolactin alterations in transgender persons is often assigned to oestrogens, but the precise cause and time course during different phases of cross-sex hormone treatment (CHT) remain unclear. In this study, we prospectively examined prolactin levels in 55 female-to-males (FtMs) and 61 male-to-females (MtFs) during the first year of CHT. Because long-term prolactin data were not available in this population, we studied these levels in a retrospective population of 25 FtMs and 38 MtFs who underwent gonadectomy. FtMs were treated with testosterone and MtFs with estradiol, with or without the anti-androgen cyproterone acetate (CPA) (after gonadectomy CPA is cessated). During the first year of CHT, prolactin decreased with 25% (95CI: -33%, -12%) in FtMs and increased with 193% (95CI: 156%, 219%) in MtFs. Eighteen MtFs developed hyperprolactinemia (≥0.6 IU L},

Therefore, the authors tested the hypotheses that (1) the incidence of pauses and apneas also increase under anesthesia; (2) there is a difference in the incidence between mouse strains; and (3) there is a difference in the incidence of pauses and apneas depending on the volatile agent. The authors assessed respiratory pauses and apneas at rest; during anesthesia with isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane; and at recovery in C3, B6, and F1 mice. The results are compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) (P<.05). Awake, there was no difference between mouse strains (Bb, 0.3+/-0.7 P min(-1), C3, 0.4+/-0.7 P min(-1) and F1, 0.4+/-0.5 P min(-1)). In contrast, during anesthesia C3 mice showed a significantly higher incidence of pauses and apneas. There was no increase for B6 and F1 mice. There was no difference depending on the volatile agent. These results indicate an inheritance of a susceptibility to pauses and apneas under the influence of volatile anesthetics, albeit independent of the agent used. This response seems to be independent from the inherited response to hypercapnia.},

Previous isolated forearm technique data suggest that the incidence of connected consciousness may approach 37% after a noxious stimulus. The authors conducted an international, multicenter, pragmatic study to establish the incidence of isolated forearm technique responsiveness after intubation in routine practice. Two hundred sixty adult patients were recruited at six sites into a prospective cohort study of the isolated forearm technique after intubation. Demographic, anesthetic, and intubation data, plus postoperative questionnaires, were collected. Univariate statistics, followed by bivariate logistic regression models for age plus variable, were conducted. The incidence of isolated forearm technique responsiveness after intubation was 4.6% (12/260); 5 of 12 responders reported pain through a second hand squeeze. Responders were younger than nonresponders (39 ± 17 vs. 51 ± 16 yr old; P = 0.01) with more frequent signs of sympathetic activation (50% vs. 2.4%; P = 0.03). No participant had explicit recall of intraoperative events when questioned after surgery (n = 253). Across groups, depth of anesthesia monitoring values showed a wide range; however, values were higher for responders before (54 ± 20 vs. 42 ± 14; P = 0.02) and after (52 ± 16 vs. 43 ± 16; P = 0.02) intubation. In patients not receiving total intravenous anesthesia, exposure to volatile anesthetics before intubation reduced the odds of responding (odds ratio, 0.2 [0.1 to 0.8]; P = 0.02) after adjustment for age. Intraoperative connected consciousness occurred frequently, although the rate is up to 10-times lower than anticipated. This should be considered a conservative estimate of intraoperative connected consciousness.},

Subsequently, ob/ob mice received either leptin or vehicle and measurements were repeated. Compared to baseline, for +/+ mice, RR decreased significantly by 9.4% +/- 3.0% (means +/- SD), whereas Vt remained unchanged. Transition from normoxia to hyperoxia did not change RR and Vt in untreated ob/ob mice, whereas after leptin treatment, RR and Vt decreased significantly. Leptin deficiency abolishes the response to hyperoxia, which is restored by leptin replacement. Thus, leptin seems to be influential for a competent peripheral chemoreceptor function.},

Current gas cells are only capable of temperature measurement on a global (mm) scale, although the local temperature at the spot of observation (µm to nm scale) may significantly differ. Thus, local temperature fluctuations caused by gas flow and heat dissipation dynamics remain undetected when solely relying on the global device feedback. In this study, we overcome this limitation by measuring the specimen temperature in situ utilizing parallel-beam electron diffraction at gold nanoparticles. By combining this technique with an advanced data processing algorithm, we achieve sub-Kelvin precision in both, vacuum as well as gaseous environments. Mitigating charging effects is furthermore shown to minimize systematic errors. By utilizing this method, we characterize the local thermal stability of a state-of-the-art gas cell equipped with heating capability in vacuum and under various gas-flow conditions. Our findings provide crucial reference for in situ investigations into catalysis.},

However, these mechanisms are unlikely to play a role in anemia at the start of sepsis. Moreover, sequestration of fluids, renal failure and increase of intravascular space may additionally influence the change in hemoglobin concentration during intravenous fluid administration in the acute phase of sepsis. In this retrospective study, patients who were admitted acutely to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. Patients who fulfilled the international criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock were included in the sepsis group (S-group). The remaining patients were allocated to the control group (C-group). Laboratory data from blood samples taken at first presentation to the hospital and at admission to the ICU, the amount of intravenous fluid administration and length of stay in the emergency department were collected and tested for significant differences between groups. The difference in hemoglobin concentration between the S-group (n = 296) and C-group (n = 320) at first presentation in hospital was not significant (8.8 ± 1.2 versus 8.9 ± 1.2 mmol/l, respectively, p = 0.07). The reduction in hemoglobin concentration from the first presentation at the emergency department to ICU admission was significantly greater in the S-group compared to the C-group (1 [0.5-1.7] versus 0.5 [0.1-1.1] mmol/l, (p < 0.001)). Spearman rho correlation coefficients between the reduction in hemoglobin concentration and the amount of intravenous fluids administered or the creatinine level in the emergency department were significant (0.3 and 0.4, respectively, p < 0.001). In a multivariate regression analysis, creatinine, the amount of fluid administration and the presence of sepsis remained independently associated. Prior to in-hospital intravenous fluid administration, there is no significant difference in hemoglobin concentration between acute septic patients and acutely ill controls. Within several hours after hospital admission, there is a significant reduction in hemoglobin concentration, not only associated with the amount of intravenous fluids administered and the creatinine level, but also independently with sepsis itself.},

Men, aged between 55 and 75 years, with elevated PSA levels underwent lateralized sextant needle biopsies. In corresponding radical prostatectomy specimens, the tumor categories (minimal, moderate, or advanced) were determined. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 5.1% of 19,970 screened men, and 31.6 % of the men had cancers that were categorized as "minimal." Repeat biopsies performed after initial diagnoses of either isolated prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia (PIN) or "suspicious for malignancy," detected adenocarcinoma in 12.1%and 36.5 % of the men, respectively. In a substudy of 510 men with a benign biopsy outcome 12 months previously, repeat biopsies detected adenocarcinoma in 12.4 of the men. Of men who were subsequently treated with radical prostatectomy, the cancers were classified as "minimal" in 27.8% of the men with previously benign biopsies and in 47.4% of the men with previously suspicious lesions, The chance of finding a "minimal" prostate cancer in an asymptomatic population is substantial and increases when a repeat biopsy is performed following a biopsy with a suspicious outcome.},

To investigate the effect of rape on sexual problems and on pelvic floor problems, as well as the mediating role of pelvic floor problems on sexual problems, in a homogenous group of victims of adolescence rape without a history of childhood sexual, physical, and/or emotional abuse. Sexual functioning and pelvic floor functioning were assessed using self-report questionnaires. In this cross-sectional study, a group of 89 young women aged 18-25 years who were victimized by rape in adolescence was compared with a group of 114 nonvictimized controls. The rape victims were treated for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) 3 years prior to participation in the study. Three years posttreatment, rape victims were 2.4 times more likely to have a sexual dysfunction (lubrication problems and pain) and 2.7 times more likely to have pelvic floor dysfunction (symptoms of provoked vulvodynia, general stress, lower urinary tract, and irritable bowel syndrome) than nonvictimized controls. The relationship between rape and sexual problems was partially mediated by the presence of pelvic floor problems. Rape victims and controls did not differ with regard to sexual activities. Rape victims suffer significantly more from sexual dysfunction and pelvic floor dysfunction when compared with nontraumatized controls, despite the provision of treatment for PTSD. Possibly, physical manifestations of PTSD have been left unaddressed in treatment. Future treatment protocols should consider incorporating (physical or psychological) treatment strategies for sexual dysfunction and/or pelvic floor dysfunction into trauma exposure treatments.},

A total of 80 patients with LLD from the prospective naturalistic follow-up Mood Disorders in Elderly treated with Electroconvulsive Therapy study were examined. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired before ECT. Overall brain morphology (white and grey matter) was evaluated using visual rating scales. Cognitive functioning before, during, and after ECT was measured using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). A linear mixed-model analysis was performed to analyze the association between structural brain alterations and cognitive functioning over time. Patients with moderate to severe white matter hyperintensities (WMH) showed significantly lower MMSE scores than patients without severe WMH (F(1,75.54) = 5.42, p = 0.02) before, during, and post-ECT, however their trajectory of cognitive functioning was similar as no time × WMH interaction effect was observed (F(4,65.85) = 1.9, p = 0.25). Transient cognitive impairment was not associated with medial temporal or global cortical atrophy (MTA, GCA). All patients showed a significant drop in cognitive functioning during ECT, which however recovered above baseline levels post-ECT and remained stable until at least 6 months post-ECT, independently of severity of WMH, GCA, or MTA. Therefore, clinicians should not be reluctant to start or continue ECT in patients with severe structural brain alterations.},

Statistical evaluation was based on Cox regression analysis. During the prevalence screening, 1014 patients were diagnosed with pCA. Median follow up was 55 mo, 126 (12.4%) patients died, 20 (2.0%) of pCA. Overall 5-yr observed and expected disease-specific survival was 97.7% and 82%, respectively.

The observed survival data are in line with the literature and the expected favorable outcome for a screened population. The proportion of men dying from pCA is still small, and a 10-yr follow-up period for the final evaluation of the ERSPC may be too short.},

For this study, men with criteria that reflect current active surveillance studies were selected: those with a biopsy Gleason score < or =3+3 in two or fewer cores, with a PSA density <0.2 and a maximum PSA-level of 15 ng/ml. Clinical stage had to be T1C or T2. Of the 1,014 prostate cancers detected in the prevalence screen, 293 men (28.9%) met the criteria for active surveillance. Their mean age was 65.7 and the mean PSA level was 4.8 ng/ml. Radical prostatectomy was elected by 136 men (46.4%), radiotherapy by 91 (31.1%), and watchful waiting by 64 (21.8%). The mean follow-up was 80.8 months. The eight-year prostate cancer-specific survival was 99.2%; the overall survival was 85.4%. Nineteen men who chose watchful waiting changed to definitive treatment during follow-up. Only three men died of prostate cancer, none of whom were on watchful waiting. Our observations provide preliminary validation of the arbitrary selection criteria for active surveillance.},

The symposium focused on the current knowledge of these autoantibodies' role in various diseases, such as cardiovascular, renal, infectious (COVID-19), and autoimmune diseases (e.g., systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus). Beyond their association with disease phenotypes, intense research related to the mechanistic action of these autoantibodies on immune regulation and pathogenesis has been developed, underscoring the role of autoantibodies targeting GPCRs on disease outcomes and etiopathogenesis. The observation repeatedly highlighted that autoantibodies targeting GPCRs could also be present in healthy individuals, suggesting that anti-GPCR autoantibodies play a physiologic role in modeling the course of diseases. Since numerous therapies targeting GPCRs have been developed, including small molecules and monoclonal antibodies designed for treating cancer, infections, metabolic disorders, or inflammatory conditions, anti-GPCR autoantibodies themselves can serve as therapeutic targets to reduce patients' morbidity and mortality, representing a new area for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.},

The latter option implies that tumors dedifferentiate in the preclinical screen-detectable phase. To model the natural history of prostate cancer, we analyzed the age-specific distribution of clinical stage and Gleason score of 2,204 tumors diagnosed in the ERSPC-Rotterdam trial. We fitted 2 MISCAN simulation models to the observed data: Model I where tumors dedifferentiate before becoming screen-detectable and Model II where dedifferentiation occurs during the screen-detectable preclinical phase. The hypothesis of dedifferentiation during the screen-detectable phase was tested by a goodness of fit test of both models. In ERSPC-Rotterdam, we observed a significantly more favorable distribution of Gleason scores in screen-detected cancers compared to cancers found in the control arm, and in cancers detected in the second round compared to cancers detected in the first round of screening. Also, a significant association between Gleason score and age at diagnosis was found, most notably in cancers detected in the first round of screening. These findings were reproduced by Model II and less so by Model I, with a significant difference in goodness of fit between the 2 models (p < 0.001). This study provides epidemiological evidence of dedifferentiation as a major mechanism of progression in prostate cancer. Tumors dedifferentiate during the screen-detectable phase and consequently screening with PSA and early treatment can possibly prevent dedifferentiation.},

In the Rotterdam section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), 4,117 men underwent sextant biopsy in the 1st screening round. The 2nd round was performed at a 4-year interval and biopsies were taken in 1,840 men. The incidences of prostate cancer, LSPC and PIN in the 1st, respectively 2nd round were 24.6, resp. 19.9% (P = 0.001), 2.7, resp. 2.8% and 0.8, resp. 2.5% (P < 0.0001). Prostate cancer incidence after repeat biopsy for LSPC in the 1st, respectively 2nd round was 36.7 and 17.0%, and after repeat biopsy for PIN 13.3% in both rounds, respectively. Men with a benign biopsy in the 1st round had a significantly lower prostate cancer incidence in the 2nd round compared to men who did not undergo biopsy in the 1st round (10.7 vs. 22.7%, P < 0.0001). The decrease of prostate cancer detection in the 2nd round was associated with an increase in the incidence of PIN. Strikingly, LSPC diagnosed during the 1st round, but not during the 2nd round were predictive for prostate cancer, while isolated PIN was never predictive for prostate cancer. PIN should not be an indication for repeat biopsy in a screening population. Importantly a 1st round benign biopsy outcome proved to be a negative predictor of subsequent prostate cancer detection.},

In that study, the prostate volume is estimated by transabdominal ultrasonography. The accuracy of those measurements was verified by comparison of transabdominal to transrectal stepwise planimetric ultrasonography as the gold standard. Also, two different transabdominal devices used were compared, and the influence of different operators was studied. Two series of measurements in 100 patients each were done. In the first series, transabdominal and transrectal sonography were pairwise compared in each patient. In the second series, transabdominal measurements were done with two devices (a hospital Aloka SSD-1700 and a portable Aloka SSD-900). Transrectal scannings were done by three investigators whilst all transabdominal scannings were done by one. Regression graphs, ratio plots and statistical analyses of the data quantified the reproducibility of different methods, observers and device types. In the transrectal-transabdominal series of prostate volume measurements (in cm3), the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.84 (p < 0.001), the mean of the means was 51.8 +/- 23.0 (mean +/- S.D.), and the mean of the differences was 1.0 +/- 1.4. In the series with two devices, the Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.73 (p < 0.001), the mean of the means was 31.0 +/- 10.9, and the mean of the differences was 1.0 +/- 1.3. No statistically significant differences were found between the transabdominal- transrectal ultrasonography, two different transabdominal devices nor between different observers. However, for those using these measurements in everyday clinical practice, it is worth to point out that in our data a transabdominal scan and a transrectal scan in the same patient, on the same day, differed more than 30% in one fourth of the patients and that two transabdominal scans in the same patient (with two different devices, on two different days) differed more than 30% in every fifth patient.},

Patient survival at 1, 5 and 10 years was 73%, 63%, and 63%, respectively. Multivariate analysis of pre-transplant variables revealed prothrombin time, creatinine level, and indication for retransplantation, as independent predictive factors. Survival was highest in patients who had undergone retransplantation for hepatic artery thrombosis. Multivariate analysis, including pre-, per-, and post-operative variables, showed that era of transplantation, prothrombin time, blood loss, and intensive care unit (ICU) stay, were independent predictive factors. Survival at 1 and 5 years improved from 56% and 48%, respectively, before 1996 to 89% and 81%, respectively, after 1996. In conclusion, survival after hepatic retransplantation improved significantly through the years.

Sextant biopsy was prompted by elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. For review, randomly taken benign sextant biopsies (n = 202) with a follow-up of at least 8 years were chosen. Before review, atrophy was reported in the biopsies of 11.4% and 8.7% of the first and second round, respectively. The prostate cancer incidence during 8 years of follow-up after an initial diagnosis of atrophy was 10.4%, which was not significantly different than the 12.3% of cancers detected after a benign diagnosis without reference to atrophy. After review, the incidence of simple atrophy, post-atrophic hyperplasia, and sclerotic atrophy in sextant biopsies was 91%, 47%, and 9%, respectively. Extensive atrophy was observed in 5% of biopsies. Only 2 men (4.7%) in the reviewed group had a subsequent diagnosis of prostate cancer in the 8 years of follow-up. Additionally, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia was diagnosed in 3 men (7.0%) in the second screening round. Atrophy, especially its simple form, is a very common lesion in prostate biopsy cores (94%). Atrophy in an asymptomatic population undergoing screening was not associated with a greater prostate cancer or prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia incidence during subsequent screening rounds.},

Elderly individuals and those with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases are at increased risk of mortality. The endothelial barrier disruption observed in patients indicates systemic viral invasion and widespread endotheliitis. Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by impaired nitric oxide (NO) production, contributes to vasoconstriction, inflammation, and coagulation abnormalities seen in COVID-19. In this study, we investigated the impact of COVID-19 patient-derived plasma on the endothelium through NO metabolite analysis using an in vitro 3D micro vessel model. Our experiments revealed alterations in NO metabolites in response to COVID-19 patient plasma perfusion, with BH4+BH2 supplementation improving citrulline levels in severe COVID-19 patient models. Positive correlation between arginase activity and eNOS activity was observed in the severe COVID-19 patient model but not in the mild COVID-19 patient model. These findings underscore the importance of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 pathogenesis and highlight potential therapeutic targets for mitigating vascular complications associated with severe infection.},

Screening includes systematic sextant needle biopsy for men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and/or positive findings on digital rectal examination or transrectal ultrasound. Detection during the second screening round of a large number of high-grade (Gleason Grade 4 or 5) malignancies and/or a large number of malignancies in general could be considered the result of a failure to identify these malignancies at an early stage, during prevalence screening. Men diagnosed during the second screening round with potentially advanced carcinoma (PAC), characterized by a biopsy Gleason score of 7 (4 + 3, or 3 + 4 with > 30% malignant involvement) or a biopsy Gleason score of 8-10, were identified. Clinical data, including PSA values on prevalence screening, biopsy history, clinical stage, and follow-up data, were retrieved for these patients. Tumor features were further analyzed in radical prostatectomy specimens. During the second screening round, 503 malignancies, including 30 (6.0%) with features of PAC on diagnostic biopsy, were detected in 11,210 patients. Curative treatment was offered to 26 patients. Prostatectomy demonstrated the presence of organ-confined disease in 11 of 12 specimens, and tumor volume ranged from 0.11-7.93 cm3 (median, 1.05 cm3). PSA failure was noted in 6 of 22 patients who were offered curative therapy. PAC is a rare finding in the second round of screening after a 4-year interval, and a substantial proportion of PAC cases detected in the second screening round represent organ-confined disease. The findings of the current study suggest that the screening protocol used is sufficiently effective for detecting > 95% of malignancies before they develop features that would make them incurable.},

The agricultural sector anticipates that these products may in future be regarded as regular mineral fertilisers. We assessed the agronomic suitability and impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) and ammonia emissions of using liquid mineral concentrates on arable farms. The phosphate requirements on arable farms were largely met by raw pig slurry, given its large regional availability. After the initial nutrient input by means of pig slurry, the nitrogen/phosphate ratio of the remaining nutrient crop requirements determined the additional amount of liquid mineral concentrates that can be used. For sandy soils, liquid mineral concentrates could supply 50% of the nitrogen requirement, whereas for clay soils the concentrates did not meet the required nitrogen/phosphate ratio. The total GHG emissions per kg of plant available nitrogen ranged from -65 to 33 kg CO2 -equivalents. It increased in the order digestates < mineral fertiliser < raw slurries. Liquid mineral concentrates had limited added value for arable farms. For an increased suitability it is necessary that liquid mineral concentrates do not contain phosphate and that the nitrogen availability is increased. In the manure-processing chain, anaerobic digestion had a dominant and beneficial effect on GHG emissions.},

Sera and tumour volumes from 91 men were available for analysis. Minimal prostate cancer was diagnosed in 16.5% of the selected cases. Mean tumour volume was 1.2 ml (range: 0.04-13.5); hK2, the algorithms hK2/fPSA, and hK2/%fPSA have significant correlations with tumour volume. Both algorithms also yielded the best test results in predicting minimal disease with an area under the receiver operator characteristics curve of 82%. hK2 and percent free PSA have added prognostic value for the detection of minimal prostate cancer in screen-detected cases within PSA range 4-10 ng/ml. These biomarkers can possibly be used to select less invasive treatment options like active surveillance and to prevent overtreatment.},

PSA progression in a 4-year interscreening interval is evaluated by determining the positive predictive values, detection rates and parameters of aggressiveness of round 2 cancers. PSA progression to more than 3.0 ng/ml occurred in 0.9%, 9.3% and 48.6% of men who presented with PSA values less than 1.0, 1 to 1.9 and 2 to 2.9 ng/ml, respectively, in round 1. Their respective positive predictive values amounted to 19.0%, 23.8% and 27.9%. Cancer detection rates increased with increasing PSA values in round 1. The distribution of low, moderate and high risk cancers depends on round 2 but not on round 1 PSA ranges. PSA progression to the (arbitrary) cutoff value of 3.0 ng/ml and the diagnosis of prostate cancer in round 2 screening with a 4-year interval depends strongly on PSA values at the time of the 1st screen. These observations will be helpful to design future screening procedures. With levels less than 2.0 ng/ml PSA progression to levels of 3.0 ng/ml or greater is rare as it was seen only in 4.8% of all men.},

One hundred eighteen men underwent RP, and 108 men were treated with WW. The median tumor volume was 0.13 mL. PSA level and prostate volume were predictive for tumor volume in a multivariate regression analysis. A PSA density cut-off level of <or=0.1 ng/mL/cm3 predicted organ-confined tumor (<0.5 mL) in 94% of patients. Positive surgical margins were predictive for PSA recurrence. Four patients in the RP group had PSA recurrence at follow-up. PSA doubling times <2 years, <3 years, and <4 years were noted in 4.9%, 14.6%, and 22.0% of patients in the WW group, respectively. The median tumor volume was small (0.13 mL). A comparison between PSA recurrence in the RP group and PSA doubling time in the WW group showed a significantly more favorable outcome after RP if a PSA doubling time of <3 years or <4 years was chosen as a marker for disease progression in the WW group.

To date, it is still unknown whether screening for prostate cancer is justified, because results of randomised clinical trials are not yet available. The available screening tests (i.e. prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test) do not always detect cancers that otherwise would have resulted in prostate cancer mortality. Favourable results from prostate cancer screening include an increasing number of men with localised disease and an increase in the number of well-differentiated tumours. However, the risk of overdiagnosis and subsequent over-treatment (due to the diagnosis of localised disease), using aggressive therapies fuels arguments against screening. Therefore, until more evidence is available proving otherwise, prostate cancer screening can only be justified in the context of clinical trials.},

  abstract = {In a longitudinal follow-up study the effect of pharmaceutical supplementation of nutrients (folate, vitamin B12, B6, B1, C, iron and proteins) was established in 25 psychogeriatric patients (subject group). A reference group of 30 apparently healthy elderly subjects was used for comparison and statistical evaluation. At the time of hospitalization percentages concerning the incidence of decreased serum concentrations reflecting an inappropriate nutrient state in the subject group amounted to 28% for vitamin B12, 20% for folate, 36% for iron, 12% for transferrin and 56% for albumin concentrations. Increased plasma concentrations of homocysteine combined with decreased folate concentrations were found in 16% of the psychogeriatric patients. If compared with the initial results at admission, after three weeks of nutrient supplementation the vitamin B12 and folate serum concentrations were increased. Results for serum iron concentrations remained below the reference range interval in 5 of the 25 subjects reflecting iron deficiency. Initially decreased serum transferrin concentrations did not return to the reference range. Serum albumin levels still further decreased after admission to the hospital, resulting after three weeks in albumin concentrations below the reference range for 68% of the subjects. It is concluded that supplementation of folate and vitamin B12 lowered homocysteine plasma concentrations successfully. Supplementation of protein nutrients is not appropriate in order to restore disturbances of protein metabolism. Persisting low concentrations of proteins in serum are indicative of irreversible decreased synthesis.},

  abstract = {The etiology of intradialytic hemodynamic instability is multifactorial. Of the various factors involved, a rise in core temperature seems to be crucial. In this respect, the bioincompatibility of hemodialysis (HD) treatment might play an important role. The application of cool dialysate reduces the number of periods of intradialytic hypotension (IDH) considerably. In rats, roller pump perfusion caused hypotension by shear stress induced platelet aggregation and subsequent serotonin release. During clinical HD, citrate anticoagulation abolished platelet activation almost completely. Hence, citrate anticoagulation might reduce IDH, whereas the beneficial effect of cool dialysate might be partly explained by reduced platelet activation. In the present study, blood pressure, IDH episodes, platelet activation, platelet aggregation, and serotonin release were studied crossover in 10 patients during HD with dalteparin anticoagulation at normal and low dialysate temperatures and during HD with citrate. Citrate strongly reduced platelet activation, but did not improve IDH. The blood pressure was best preserved during cool-temperature HD, despite manifest platelet activation. Platelet activation was not accompanied by a rise in the plasma serotonin concentration. Three major conclusions can be drawn: (1) it is unlikely that platelet activation and subsequent serotonin release underlie IDH in the clinical situation; (2) the protective effects of cool dialysate on IDH appear to be independent of HD-induced platelet activation, and (3) extrapolating results from rat experiments to the human situation requires uppermost prudence.},

  abstract = {During haemodialysis (HD), several adverse reactions in peripheral blood can occur, which have been attributed to the bioincompatibility of the dialyser membrane. Utilizing a dialyser elution technique, we have demonstrated that polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) manifested non-membrane dependent signs of activation during HD with cellulose triacetate (CTA), cuprammonium (CU) and polysulphone (PS) membranes. In the present study, we employed this elution technique to investigate the influence of HD with these membranes on lymphocytes. Eight patients were studied during HD with CTA, CU, and PS dialysers in a randomized crossover design. Dialyser elution was performed after 3 h of HD. Besides total leukocyte count and differentiation, lymphocyte subpopulations and activation status in peripheral blood and dialyser eluates were analysed by flow cytometry. Only with CU was a significant leukocyte decrease observed in peripheral blood at 30 min (P<0.001). Neither the total number of lymphocytes nor the proportion of T(CD3+) and B(CD19+) cells had markedly changed after HD with either membrane. Meanwhile, all membranes induced a relative decline in natural killer cells -NK(CD3-/CD16+/56+)- at the end of dialysis, although this was only significant for CTA (P=0.04). As for the T-lymphocyte subsets, the proportion of CD4+ cells had markedly increased after three hours of HD with all three dialysers, CTA and PS being significant (P<0.05). Dialyser eluates contained 33.8-82.2 x 10(6) cells, CTA yielding the highest cell counts. The majority (81-91%) of the eluted cells consisted of PMN dialyser eluates versus peripheral blood: P<0.05), whereas only few lymphocytes were found (4-13%, absolute 2.6 x 10(6)). Lymphocyte subpopulations in dialyser eluates were comparable to peripheral blood at t 180 in case of CTA and CU. In contrast PS eluates contained significantly fewer T-cells (37%), but more B-cells (22%) and NK-cells (30%) in comparison with peripheral blood at 180 min (peripheral blood: 79, 6 and 16% respectively; P<0.05). The expression of activation markers on T-cells (HLA-DR, CD25) in dialyser eluates was comparable with peripheral blood. Conclusions. The absolute number of lymphocytes in dialyser eluates of CTA, CU, and PS dialysers was low (mean 2.6 x 10(6)) in comparison with peripheral blood (mean 1.4 x 10(9)/l). Whereas non-selective adhesion occurred in CU and CTA dialysers, a selective adhesion pattern of lymphocyte subpopulations was observed in case of PS, suggesting a difference in bioincompatibility. Apparent T-cell activation was not noted, either in peripheral blood or in dialyser eluates. Because PMN in the dialyser eluates of three different membranes showed similar activation patterns in a previous study, we hypothesize that eluted lymphocyte, rather than PMN, represent a preferable parameter of bioincompatibility.},

Blood samples were collected at the start of the study and each 12-week period. In addition, the relationship between patient characteristics, inflammation and leptin was analysed. At baseline, all groups showed similar leptin concentrations (mean 33.6+/-21.7 ng/ml). After a single HD session, a significant (P<0.01) decrease was observed with all three high permeable devices (Tricea 150G -52.7+/-6.4%; F 60S -63.1+/-5.7%; F 500S -68.7+/-8.2%), whereas leptin remained stable with low-flux PS. After 12 weeks, a marked increase was observed with low-flux PS (week 1, 30.4+/-23.0; week 12, 40.5+/-5.4 ng/ml, P = 0.05), no change with super-flux CTA and high-flux PS (Tricea 150G week 1, 29.4+/-23.7; week 12, 32.0+/-27.9 ng/ml, P = ns; F 60S week 1, 36.0+/-31.8; week 12, 33.0+/-31.2 ng/ml, P = ns), and a significant decrease with super-flux PS (week 1, 38.3+/-33.0; week 12, 29.5+/-31.9 ng/ml, P = 0.02). The change in leptin after 12 weeks was significantly different between super-flux PS, and both low-flux PS (P = 0.009) and super-flux CTA (P = 0.01). Besides interleukin-6 (IL-6) at the start of the study (P = 0.006), no correlations were observed between patient characteristics, parameters of inflammation and plasma leptin levels. Apart from low-flux PS, plasma leptin decreased considerably with all three high permeable dialysers after a single HD session. In the long run, leptin levels were lower with high-flux PS than with low-flux PS. Moreover, after switching from high-flux PS to super-flux PS (but not super-flux CTA), an additional decrease in leptin was observed. Apart from IL-6 at the start of the study, neither patient characteristics nor inflammatory parameters correlated with plasma leptin levels in this patient group.},

We assessed the effectiveness of active feedback of treatment algorithms based on procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP), compared to standard care, on the duration of antibiotic treatment in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in non-ICU wards. We performed a randomised, open label, parallel group, multi-centre trial in 3 Dutch teaching hospitals. Treatment was guided by a PCT algorithm, CRP algorithm or standard care. Participants were recruited by a member of the study team and randomised at day 2-3 of admission in a 1:1:1 ratio. Treatment was discontinued upon predefined thresholds of biomarkers that were assessed on admission, day 4 and days 5-7 if indicated. The primary outcome was total days on antibiotic treatment until day 30. In total 468 participants were included in this study. The median days on antibiotics (IQR) was 7 (IQR 7-10) in the control group, 4 (IQR 3-7) in the CRP group (rate ratio (RR) of 0.70, 95% CI 0.61-0.82 compared to standard care; p <0.001), and 5.5 (IQR 3-9) in the PCT group (RR of 0.78, 95% CI 0.68-0.89 compared to standard care; p <0.001). New antibiotics within the first 30 days were prescribed to 24, 23 and 35 patients in standard care, CRP and PCT groups, respectively. The hazard ratio for a new prescription in patients in the PCT group compared to standard care 1.63 (CI 0.97-2.75; p = 0.06). No difference in time to clinical stability or length of stay was found. A strategy of feedback of CRP-guided and PCT-guided treatment algorithms reduced the number of days on antibiotic in the first 30 days after hospital admission in non-ICU wards for CAP.

The aim of the study was to establish the efficacy of algorithms for anemia screening including new hematologic parameters such as percentage of hypochromic and microcytic RBCs and hemoglobin content of reticulocytes. Subjects with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) (n = 142) and subjects with β-thalassemia (n = 34) were enrolled in a European multicenter study. Apparently healthy subjects were used as a reference group (n = 309). Hemocytometric investigations were performed on a Sysmex XE5000 hematology analyzer. The algorithms for IDA discrimination yielded results for area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 0.88, 79%, 97%, 74%, and 98%, respectively. The algorithms for β-thalassemia discrimination revealed similar results (0.86, 74%, 98%, 75%, and 99%, respectively). We conclude that the advanced algorithms, derived from extended RBC parameters provided by the Sysmex XE5000 analyzer, are useful as laboratory anemia screening devices.},

However, temporal sequencing studies investigating whether change in distress precedes PTSD symptom decline are lacking. These studies are essential since the timeline between indicators of change and treatment outcome is a key assumption for mediation. The aim of the present study was to assess the temporal relationship between within- and between-session change in subjective distress and PTSD symptom decrease. We analyzed session data from 86 patients with PTSD. Data were analyzed using dynamic panel models. We distinguished temporal effects (within-persons) from averaged effects (between-persons). Results regarding the temporal effect showed that within-session change in subjective distress preceded PTSD symptom improvement while the reversed effect was absent. Averaged within-session change in subjective distress was also related to PTSD symptom improvement. Results regarding the temporal effect of between-session change in subjective distress showed that it did not precede PTSD symptom improvement. Averaged between-session change in subjective distress was related to PTSD symptom improvement. This study provides evidence for within- but not between-session change in subjective distress as indicator of change during PE. We also found that the way of modeling potential indicators of change affects results and implications. We recommend future studies to analyze mediators during treatment using temporal rather than averaged effects.},

The present study was designed to investigate HD-induced changes in monocytes, with respect to their phenotypic profile and cytokine release, both in peripheral blood (PB) and dialyser eluates (DE). In addition, the effect of the type of dialyser on monocyte activation was assessed. Dialyser elution was performed in 8 patients after 3 h of HD, using cuprammonium (CU) and polysulfon (PS) dialysers in a randomised cross-over design. PB samples and DE were analysed for both the expression of a variety of monocyte cell surface markers (CD62L, CD11b, CD25, HLA-DR, CD64 and CD14) by flow cytometry and IL-1beta levels. Monocytes were identified by dual labelling with antibodies against CD14. In PB, the expression of CD11b increased during HD with both devices, but was more pronounced with CU (CU versus PS: p < 0.05). CD62L decreased during HD, but only significantly for PS (p < 0.02). HLA-DR was downregulated during HD with CU (p = 0.056). The expression of CD64 was higher during HD with CU (p = 0.02). Finally, CD14 increased during HD with both dialysers (p < 0.03). DE yielded a mean cell count of 51 x 10(6) cells. The proportion of monocytes in DE was 3% for CU and 4% for PS. In eluted monocytes, a significant upregulation of CD11b, CD25, and HLA-DR was observed. CD62L was downregulated when compared to PB at t(180) (p < 0.001). In DE, no correlation was found between the type of dialyser and the phenotypic changes. In 10 of 16 DE supernatants, 6 CU and 4 PS, IL-1beta release could be demonstrated, CU yielding significantly more of this cytokine than PS (p = 0.03). According to both their phenotypic profile and cytokine release, monocytes sticking to the dialyser membrane after HD are considerably more activated than circulating monocytes. Activation of eluted monocytes appeared independent of the type of dialyser, suggesting an effect of mechanical stress rather than bioincompatibility. In contrast, phenotypic activation of peripheral blood monocytes and cytokine release in the DE supernatant were mainly dialyser-dependent.},

The toxicity of ALPI increased from a 48 h LC50 of 18 mg L(-1) to a 21 day LC50 value of 3.2 mg L(-1), resulting in an acute-to-chronic ratio of 5.6. This may imply a change in classification from low to moderate toxicity. ALPI also affected sublethal life cycle parameters, with an EC50 of 2.8 mg L(-1) for cumulative reproductive output and of 3.4 mg L(-1) for population growth rate, revealing a nonspecific mode of action. DOPO showed only sublethal effects with an EC50 value of 48 mg L(-1) for cumulative reproductive output and an EC50 value of 73 mg L(-1) for population growth rate. The toxicity of DOPO to D. magna was classified as low and likely occurred above environmentally relevant concentrations, but we identified specific effects on reproduction. Given the low chronic toxicity of DOPO and the moderate toxicity of ALPI, based on this study only, DOPO seems to be more suitable than ALPI for BFR replacement in polymers.},

As HD treatment occurs three times a week, it has been demonstrated that PLTs are exhausted due to the repetitive character of the treatment. To identify PLT depletion morphologically, PLT evaluation was performed by light microscopy and electron microscopy (EM) in a chronic HD subject and a healthy reference subject. Blood samples were taken before the start of HD treatment for measurement of PLT count, PLT volume and size parameters. Blood smears were screened by light microscopy for qualitative evaluation of PLT granule containing cytoplasm, as indicated by its staining density. Morphological PLT parameters of surface area and size of dense bodies were assessed by EM. Data were compared with results of a group of 20 chronic HD subjects and a group of 20 healthy reference subjects. With respect to the percentage of PLTs with appropriate staining density (>75%), light microscopic evaluation showed that this value (9%) was within the range of a group of chronic HD subjects, but considerably below the reference range (70%). EM evaluation revealed an average PLT surface area and dense bodies area of respectively 42% and 31%, if the healthy reference subject was set on 100%. PLTs from a chronic HD subject are considerably smaller and substantially less granular than PLTs from a healthy reference subject. These findings support the hypothesis of PLT depletion in chronic HD subjects due to frequent PLT activation and/or increased urea concentrations.},

  abstract = {During haemodialysis treatment, blood flows from the body to the extracorporeal circuit and vice versa. In this study, pathophysiological defects in platelets indicated by alterations in RNA content and aberrations in platelet volume and morphology are detected before and during haemodialysis treatment. In subjects receiving haemodialysis treatment, qualitative interpretation of platelet characteristics with application of light microscopic evaluation reveals only 19+/-11 % of platelets with appropriate staining density of the granule-containing cytoplasm. On the contrary, a reference group of apparently healthy subjects shows 70+/-12 % platelets with appropriate staining density of the granule-containing cytoplasm. During haemodialysis treatment, mean values for platelet volume, platelet distribution width and platelet large cell ratio demonstrate a tendency to decrease by 10 %, 11 % and 6 %, respectively, from the mean initial value to the value at t = 150 min. Reduction of the platelet volume parameters just mentioned is hypothesized to be due to platelet degranulation as a result of platelet activation.},

ABM and the control treatment were equally effective in reducing the symptoms of PTSD. The effect sizes of the improvement (from before to after treatment) were 0.66 for ABM and 0.46 for the control treatment, which is comparable to the effect sizes of pill-placebos in pharmacotherapy trials of chronic PTSD.

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of an electronic learning (e-learning) module on the adherence to suicide prevention guidelines, knowledge of practical skills, and provider's confidence to have a conversation about suicidal behavior with undergraduate psychology students. The e-learning module, comprising video recordings of therapist-patient interactions, was designed with the aim of transferring knowledge about suicide prevention guideline recommendations. The program's effects on guideline adherence, self-evaluated knowledge, and provider's confidence were assessed using online questionnaires before the program (baseline and at 1 month [T1] and 3 months after baseline). The eligible third- and fourth-year undergraduate psychology students were randomly allocated to the e-learning (n=211) or to a waitlist control condition (n=187), with access to the intervention after T1. Overall, the students evaluated e-learning in a fairly positive manner. The intention-to-treat analysis showed that the students in the intervention condition (n=211) reported higher levels of self-evaluated knowledge, provider's confidence, and guideline adherence than those in the waitlist control condition (n=187) after receiving the e-learning module (all P values<.001). When comparing the scores at the 1- and 3-month follow-up, after both groups had received access to the e-learning module, the completers-only analysis showed that the levels of knowledge, guideline adherence, and confidence remained constant (all P values>.05) within the intervention group, whereas a significant improvement was observed in the waitlist control group (all P values<.05). An e-learning intervention on suicide prevention could be an effective first step toward improved knowledge of clinical skills. The learning outcomes of a stand-alone module were found to be similar to those of a training that combined e-learning with a face-to-face training, with the advantages of flexibility and low costs.},

  abstract = {During haemodialysis (HD), polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and platelets are activated and release various granule products, including myeloperoxidase (MPO) and platelet factor 4 (PF4). MPO triggers the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to irreversible protein, carbohydrate and lipid modification. PF4 probably also contributes to oxidative stress. As previously shown, HD-induced PMN degranulation is almost completely abolished during citrate anticoagulation, most probably due to its calcium chelation ability. In the present study, apart from HD-induced PMN and platelet degranulation, oxidative stress was analysed during three modes of anticoagulation. Heparin, dalteparin and citrate (HDhep, HDdal and HDcit) were compared in a randomized, crossover fashion in eight chronic HD patients. Multiple blood samples were taken during the third HD session of each modality, from both the afferent and efferent line. Besides the degranulation markers MPO and PF4, various markers of oxidative stress were measured, including oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), malondialdehyde (MDA) and carboxymethyllysine (CML). During HDhep and HDdal, marked degranulation was observed shortly after the start of HD. In contrast, during HDcit, PF4 and MPO levels remained unaltered, suggesting no release at all. After 1 week of HDcit, ox-LDL levels were markedly reduced [median 26% (3-65%), P=0.01], if compared with HDhep and HDdal. As regards MDA and CML, no differences were found. This study shows first, that HD-induced PMN and platelet degranulation are early, most probably calcium-dependent processes and, secondly, that the formation of ox-LDL is clearly dependent on the type of anticoagulant applied.},

However, the correlation between the flow cytometric methods was satisfactory (r = 0.79). Reference ranges for the reticulocyte count, corresponding with the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile, were determined for the microscopic (8-30/1000), FACScan (11-27/1000) and Sysmex (8-18/1000) methods.

To determine the influence of dissociative symptoms on psychotherapy outcome in PTSD. We conducted a systematic search in Cochrane, Embase, PILOTS, PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science for relevant clinical trials. A random-effects meta-analysis examined the impact of dissociation on psychotherapy outcome in PTSD (pre-registered at Prospero CRD42018086575). Twenty-one trials (of which nine were randomised controlled trials) with 1714 patients were included. Pre-treatment dissociation was not related to treatment effectiveness in patients with PTSD (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.04, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.13). Between-study heterogeneity was high but was not explained by moderators such as trauma focus of the psychotherapy or risk of bias score. There was no indication for publication bias. We found no evidence that dissociation moderates the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. The quality of some of the included studies was relatively low, emphasising the need for high-quality clinical trials in patients with PTSD. The results suggest that pre-treatment dissociation does not determine psychotherapy outcome in PTSD.},

In addition to total cell count and microscopic leukocyte differentiation, the expression of degranulation (CD63, CD66b) and adhesion (CD62L) markers on PMN was analysed in peripheral blood over time, and in dialyser eluates at the end of HD. In peripheral blood a significant drop in PMN was noted only during CU HD (P < 0.001), whereas none of the membranes induced any substantial change in the expression of the activation markers mentioned. In dialyser eluates the mean number of cells was 53 x 10(6), CTA yielding a significantly higher number as compared with CU (P = 0.05). The proportion of PMN was 81-91% (P < 0.05 versus peripheral blood). The expression of CD63, and especially CD66b, in dialyser eluates of all membranes was significantly higher in comparison with peripheral blood, whereas the expression of CD62L in dialyser eluates was considerably lower. Dialyser eluates of all three dialysers consisted mainly of PMN. Based on the relatively modest cell numbers and the expression of the activation markers described, our results suggest primarily degranulation within the dialyser. Apart from differences in cell numbers, CTA yielding the highest cell counts, no differences between CTA, CU, and PS could be demonstrated in dialyser eluates.},

Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (RET-He) is considered to be an actual indicator reflecting functional iron availability for erythropoiesis. In the present study, interdependence between biochemical analytes reflecting iron status and hemocytometric parameters indicating the degree of hemoglobinization of reticulocytes and red blood cells, respectively, is established. Participants of the study were reference subjects (n=75), subjects with iron deficiency anemia (n=52), subjects with uremia (n=19) and subjects undergoing hemodialysis treatment (n=43). If compared with the reference subjects the results for RBC counts and MCHC are statistically significantly decreased in case of subjects with hemodialysis and uremia, whereas increased results are established with regard to RDW-sd values. Significantly increased results for absolute reticulocyte counts and immature reticulocyte fractions (IRF) are also observed in case of subjects with hemodialysis and uremia. Slightly increased values for the ZPP/heme ratio in combination with elevated reticulocyte count reflect increased activity of erythropoiesis. At a definite MCV value, decreased levels for the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (RET-He) and hemoglobin content of red blood cells (RBC-He) are observed in case of subjects treated with hemodialysis and in subjects with uremia if compared with identical MCV values of the group of reference subjects. For the ratio of RET-He and RBC-He obviously decreased results are demonstrated in case of subjects with iron deficiency anemia (1.02 +/- 0.08, mean +/- SD), hemodialysis (1.05 +/- 0.05) and uremia (1.02 +/- 0.10) if compared with the group of reference subjects (1.11 +/- 0.02). From the combined interpretation of the MCV values within the reference range and decreased values for RET-He and RET-He/RBC-He ratios, respectively, a decreased degree of hemoglobinization is concluded in the case of subjects with hemodialysis or uremia. The conclusion implicating the presumption of reduced functional availability of iron for hemoglobin synthesis is supported by the detection of increased results for sTfR concentrations and ZPP/heme ratios.},

A reference group of apparently healthy blood donors (n = 262) demonstrated in only three samples a positive suspect flag, which could not be confirmed microscopically. Positive WBC suspect flags were demonstrated in 3% of the 2011 samples. From the 55 samples with positive WBC suspect flags, an automatic reflex test was performed within the WPC. The WPC reflex test resulted in 10× Blast?, 15× Abnormal lymph? and 15× Atypical lymph? flags, which could be confirmed microscopically in 33% of these cases. A negative flagging was demonstrated in 15 cases. Microscopic evaluation demonstrated no abnormalities in these 15 cases. However, laboratory technicians also reported the presence of abnormal lymphocytes in 158 samples without an Abnormal lymph? flag. In conclusion, the combined use of WDF and WPC resulted in a reduction of approximately 25% of the number blood smears. As a result of the various techniques for light microscopy and haemocytometry, the adequacy of the XN flagging for abnormal and atypical lymphocytes cannot be established with certainty. To improve the quality of the reported results, it is recommended that laboratory technicians incorporate the haemocytometry results and the flagging information in the microscopic slide review.},

Leukocyte counts and PCT concentrations did not differ between inpatients and outpatients. Overall, only 13/65 patients had an increased leukocyte count and only 11/65 patients presented with PCT concentrations indicative of possible bacterial respiratory tract infection. Infiltrative changes on the chest X-ray were observed in the majority of patients. CURB-65 score was 0+/-1 (mean+/-SD). Acute Q-fever, a relatively mild pneumonia with low CURB-65 scores, specifically induces a response in CRP, while PCT concentrations and leukocytes are within the normal range or increased only marginally.},

PLT characteristics [PLT numbers, mean PLT volume (MPV), PLT distribution width (PDW), PLT large cell ratio (p-LCR), immature PLT fraction] and activation status [CD62p expression, platelet factor 4 (PF4) and beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) plasma levels] were estimated in 19 patients before and during HD. Blood was sampled from both the afferent and efferent lines. Additionally, the influence of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on PF4 and BTG concentrations was analyzed. CD62p expression increased in the extracorporeal circuit (ECC) in the first 30 min. Simultaneously, PLT numbers dropped markedly within the ECC. MPV, PDW and p-LCR decreased over time. Like CD62p expression, BTG reached peak values at t30, was exclusively released within the ECC and was not influenced by the application of LMWH. In contrast, PF4 was significantly released outside the ECC in response to LMWH. PLTs are predominantly activated within the ECC and not on a remote distance. PLTs stick to the ECC, particularly after first passage. BTG is an appropriate marker for HD-induced PLT degranulation, whereas PF4 originates from both activated PLTs and LMWH-induced detachment from the endothelium. PLTs are not exhausted due to the repetitive stimulation of clinical HD. Hence, dialysis modalities with longer duration or greater frequency may be associated with a less beneficial PLT activation profile, which may counteract their clinical benefits.},

In the present study uraemia and HD induced changes, with particular emphasis on PLT granules depletion, activation of coagulation and endothelial integrity were investigated. To detect depletion of PLT granules, peripheral blood slide smears were screened by light microscopy for qualitative evaluation of PLT granule containing cytoplasm, as indicated by its granules staining density. Activation of coagulation was investigated by establishement of thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) and fibrinogen concentrations. To evaluate endothelial integrity proendothelin (proET-1) plasma concentrations were established. Results of our study demonstrate that proET-1 plasma concentrations were obviously increased in the subjects' group with end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and renal failure if compared with a group of apparently healthy subjects. The amount of depleted PLT granules was obviously increased in the subjects' group with end-stage CKD if compared with the group with renal failure. Mean plasma concentrations of TAT and fibrinogen revealed results within the reference range. It is demonstrated that uraemia is associated with endothelial damage and aberrations in PLT granules morphology in subjects with HD treatment. We hypothesize that increased proET-1 concentrations reflect ongoing stress on endothelial cells amongst others due to uraemia. Biomarkers like proET-1 and aberrations in PLT granules morphology assist in the early detection of procoagulant activity of the endothelium.},

The present study investigated the psychometric characteristics of the Dutch version of the posttraumatic cognitions inventory (PTCI) and evaluated its potential as an outcome measure. Data were collected from a treatment-seeking sample of trauma victims (n=158) and a college sample (n=178). The PTCI's three-factor structure was retained in both samples. The PTCI demonstrated high internal consistency and two-week test-retest reliability. Convergent validity was evidenced by a pattern of correlations with instruments for trauma-related cognitions, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depressive symptoms that largely met a priori expectations. Reductions in self-reported and clinician-assessed posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were positively associated with decreased PTCI scores, indicating that the PTCI could assist treatment evaluation.

  abstract = {One reason for the inclusion of Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) was its suspected relevance for treatment indications. We investigated whether CPTSD predicted and moderated treatment outcomes of Prolonged Exposure (PE), intensified PE (iPE) and Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation followed by PE (STAIR + PE). We expected that CPTSD would predict worse treatment outcomes across treatments. Secondly, we expected that CPTSD would lead to better treatment effect in STAIR + PE compared to PE and iPE. We analyzed 149 patients with childhood-abuse related PTSD from a randomized clinical trial. CPTSD diagnosis and symptom severity were measured with the International Trauma Questionnaire. The main outcome was change in clinician-assessed PTSD symptoms. Assessments took place at baseline, week 4, week 8, week 16 (post-treatment) and at a 6-and 12-month follow-up. Analyses were based on an intention-to-treat sample using mixed effect models. More than half (54 %) of the patients met criteria for CPTSD at baseline. CPTSD was related to more severe PTSD symptoms and higher comorbidity at baseline. CPTSD neither predicted nor moderated treatment outcome. Inclusion was limited to patients with PTSD related to childhood abuse. Replication is needed in different samples. CPTSD is associated with more severe PTSD and with higher comorbidity. CPTSD did not predict treatment outcome and did not indicate differential treatment outcome of STAIR + PE compared to PE and iPE.},

  abstract = {Childhood maltreatment is associated with all types of eating disorders. We provide a systematic review of the recent literature on comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with eating disorders, and focus on prevalence, relationship with symptom severity, operating mechanisms and treatment. The prevalence of comorbid PTSD in patients with eating disorders ranges from 9 to 24%, with research suggesting that comorbid PTSD is associated with more severe eating disorder symptoms. Maladaptive emotional regulation strategies may mediate the relationship between PTSD and eating disorders. Two pilot studies provide preliminary evidence that concurrent cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for PTSD and eating disorders may be beneficial and that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) could be helpful in the treatment of PTSD in some eating disorder patients. PTSD is a common comorbidity in patients with eating disorders and impacts the severity of their eating disorder symptoms. However, there is little research into concurrent treatments for PTSD and eating disorders. Difficulties in emotional regulation may be a common mechanism in both disorders.},

  abstract = {Over 6 million people have fled their homes in response to the full-scale invasion of Russian armed forces into Ukraine and are forcibly displaced since the start on 4 February 2022. Refugees, both adults and children, have a high risk of developing mental health disorders, in particular post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety disorders. Research into the mental health of Ukrainian families and their needs is urgently needed. The primary aim of this study is to increase our understanding of the consequences of potentially traumatic events for the mental health of parents and children. This may inform the development of mental health and psychosocial support interventions which can be readily implemented in the family context. We will conduct a four-wave longitudinal online survey study among Ukrainian families displaced to the Netherlands. This study is a part of the Nadiya data collection, intended to assess the mental health responses of Ukrainian refugee families to the stress of war, forced migration, family separation and adaptation to new circumstances in their hosting country. Participants are assessed at four time points, approximately 6 months apart. Data collection for T1 started in May 2023. We aim to recruit a total of n=1500 participants at T1, of which n=1000 adults (18 years and older) and n=500 children (8-11 years) and teenagers (12-17 years). To investigate symptom profiles and associated risk and protective factors among parents and children, we will use latent class growth modelling. The data collection procedure has been approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Social Sciences of Utrecht University. Data will be deposited, stored and shared using Utrecht University's institutional research data repository Yoda. This research project is part of the Global Collaboration on Traumatic Stress; all authors are affiliated with this network. The findings will be published in peer-reviewed, open access journals and further disseminated through conference presentations, news updates at the project website and on the websites of the Dutch Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (www.ntvp.nl), and the European Society of Traumatic Stress Studies, as well as through media contributions.

Different patterns with time indicate that there is no correlation between an increased amount of depleted PLTs and increased amounts of PLT activation markers such as CD62p, PF4, β-TG and serotonin. A statistically significant correlation between increased PLT activation markers and markers for increased activation of coagulation such as TAT and F1+2 has not been established. Only a weak correlation is demonstrated between the increase of markers for activation of coagulation and the decrease in PLT counts, immature PLT counts and depleted PLTs during HD treatment. The change in the extracorporeal circuit during HD is probably a more critical factor in the mechanism leading to activation of the coagulation pathway than the modifications in PLT morphology.},

Blood samples collected at the start of the study and after twelve weeks were analyzed for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP). In addition to the microbiological quality of the dialysate, the appearance of a "clinical event" was assessed. At baseline, mean IL-6 levels were within the reference range whereas mean CRP levels were slightly elevated. Mean values did not change after 12 weeks of HD with either modality. After subdividing the patients in quartiles with increasing change in plasma CRP, 23.0% of the patients showed a change of more than 8.0 mg/L. In a multiple regression analysis, CRP levels appeared to be independent of the degree of dialysate contamination, the material and the flux characteristics of the devices. In fact, the variable "clinical events" was the only significant predictor of the plasma CRP levels (P < 0.001). Based on these results, both PS and CTA super-flux dialyzers appear safe for clinical use. Whether changes in CRP values, which are associated with intercurrent clinical events, influence the long-term prognosis of chronic HD patients remains to be established.},

Peak concentrations for thrombin antithrombin complexes (50 to 120 microg/L) were observed 30 min after the start of haemodialysis. Establishment of thrombus precursor protein concentrations yielded steadily increasing results without any tendency to decrease during treatment. Determination of thrombin antithrombin complexes is considered to establish the most sensitive short-term reacting parameter indicating activation of coagulation. A steady generation of fibrin and fibrinogen-fibrin complexes during treatment with haemodialysis is indicated by increasing results for thrombus precursor protein. In order to prevent clotting during haemodialysis, an additional supplementation of anticoagulant is needed.},

This study aimed to evaluate suPAR's prognostic role for CAP severity compared to other biomarkers and severity scores. A total of 204 hospitalised CAP patients were enrolled. C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), suPAR, CURB-65 and Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) scores were measured at admission, and patients were followed for 365 days. The primary outcome was the relationship between suPAR levels and CAP severity based on IDSA/ATS guidelines. Secondary outcomes included time to clinical stability (TTCS), length of stay (LOS) and mortality. Among 204 patients, 174 (85%) had non-severe and 30 (15%) had severe CAP. SuPAR levels were not associated with severe CAP (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.88-1.21; AUC 0.53). Unlike the PSI and CURB-65 scores, suPAR did not correlate with TTCS (HR PSI 0.80, HR CURB-65 0.86), though all three markers were correlated to LOS (AUC suPAR 0.61). Only suPAR was significantly associated with 30-day mortality (HR 1.51, AUC 0.68). The prognostic value of suPAR for CAP severity is low, and it does not provide additional prognostic benefit over the CURB-65 or PSI scores in predicting CAP severity. While it has moderate predictive ability for 30-day mortality, its utility for predicting LOS or TTCS is low. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01964495.},

  abstract = {During haemodialysis (HD), an early and transient white blood cell (WBC) reduction is noted in the peripheral blood, which has been attributed mainly to the sequestration of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) in the pulmonary vasculature. However, WBC also adhere to the dialyser, as demonstrated before in an elution study performed after HD. In the present study, we investigated if intradialyser WBC sequestration contributes to the WBC nadir in the blood shortly after the start of HD and whether or not different mechanisms underlie PMN adherence in dialyser and lung. In addition, PMN degranulation was analysed not only in peripheral blood but also in dialyser eluates (DE). Dialysers were eluted after 7 1/2 (DE-7 1/2) and 180 (DE-180) min of HD in eight patients. Blood samples were taken before HD (t0), and at t7 1/2 and t180. Besides WBC count and differentiation, PMN adhesion (CD11b and CD62L) and degranulation markers (CD63 and CD66b) were assessed by flow cytometry. In the blood, a WBC fall was noted at t7 1/2 (from 5.8 to 4.8 x 10(9)/l; absolute about 5 x 10(9) cells). DE contained 3.0 x 10(6) cells at t7 1/2, and 57.2 x 10(6) at t180 (P = 0.015). As for CD11b, at t7 1/2 both in the blood and DE an increased expression was observed, as compared to t0 (P = 0.01); CD11b expression in DE-7 1/2 was higher than in DE-180 (P = 0.025). In contrast, CD62L showed downregulation only in DE both at t7 1/2 (mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) PB 4172 and DE-7 1/2 2353, P = 0.01), and at t180 (MFI 794, P = 0.03 versus DE-7 1/2), when compared to blood at t0. As for degranulation markers, an increase was observed in blood at t7 1/2 (MFI CD63 from 357 to 506, P = 0.02; CD66b from 507 to 794, P = 0.001), in comparison with t0. Eluted PMN at t7 1/2 showed a higher expression of CD63 than PMN in blood at t7 1/2 and DE-180 (MFI in DE-7 1/2 1280 and blood 506, P = 0.003). The expression of CD66b was increased in DE-7 1/2 (MFI 1803 versus blood 794, P = 0.01), and even more in DE-180 (MFI 2763, P = 0.002), when compared to blood. From these data it is concluded first, that intradialyser PMN sequestration does not contribute markedly to the WBC nadir in the circulation. Second, intradialyser PMN trapping appears to result primarily from non-adhesion-molecule-mediated factors, as indicated by an increased expression of CD11b at t7 1/2 on eluted PMN associated with low cell numbers in DE, and normalized CD11b expression at t180 associated with considerably higher cell numbers in DE. Third, HD-induced degranulation seems to be a complex phenomenon. After a rapid transient onset, characterized by an early upregulation of CD63 and CD66b on PMN leaving the dialyser, degranulation continues within the device as indicated by an additional rise in the expression of CD66b on PMN in DE-180.},

The SSC guideline was used as base for a national procedure. Almost all recommendations of the SSC were followed e.g. no adjustment of PRP, citrate concentration of 109 mM, 21 needle gauge, fasting, resting time for whole blood and PRP, centrifugation time, speed and agonists concentrations. LTA of healthy volunteers was measured in a total of 16 hospitals with 5 hospitals before and after standardization. Results of more than 120 healthy volunteers (maximum aggregation %) were collected, with participating laboratories using 4 different analyzers with different reagents. Use of low agonist concentrations showed high variation before and after standardization, with the exception of collagen. For most high agonist concentrations (ADP, collagen, ristocetin, epinephrine and arachidonic acid) variability in healthy subjects decreased after standardization. We can conclude that a standardized Dutch protocol for LTA, based on the SSC guideline, does not result in smaller variability in healthy volunteers for all agonist concentrations.},

Peri-operative blood samples were analyzed with a Lorrca MaxSIS Ektacytometer and erythrocyte membrane phospholipids were determined with gas chromatography. Patient and operation characteristics were equal between groups. There was a significant increase in erythrocyte membrane eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the n-PUFA group. There were no significant differences in erythrocyte deformability but the aggregation index (AI) was significantly lower and the aggregation half time (T½) was significantly higher in the n-3 PUFA group. This study confirms rapid changes in erythrocyte membrane phospholipid composition after administration of intravenous n-3 PUFAs. Erythrocyte deformability parameters were not affected but erythrocyte aggregability was decreased in the n-3 PUFA group. Further investigation is necessary to gain more insights in the effects of n-3 PUFA and the postoperative inflammatory response on erythrocyte function.},

The aim of the present study was to evaluate alterations with regard to the degree of hemoglobinization in reticulocytes in comparison with mature erythrocytes. Iron availability in subjects with anemia resulting from iron deficiency and alpha- or beta- thalassemia was studied by application of conventional as well hemocytometric parameters that have recently become available. Participants of the study were reference subjects (n=75), subjects with iron deficiency anemia (IDA, n=52) and alpha- (n=26) or beta-thalassemia trait (n=24). If compared with the reference group obviously increased RBC counts together with decreased values for RDW-sd and MCHC were established in case of alpha- and beta- thalassemia subjects. Deviations were demonstrated to be more pronounced in case of beta- thalassemia. Accelerated erythropoiesis in the case of subjects with IDA and beta-thalassemia is manifested by detection of increased results for immature reticulocyte counts. In particular in case of beta- thalassemia, elevated reticulocyte counts combined with slightly increased values for ZPP/heme ratio reflect increased activity of erythropoiesis. In the case of subjects with beta-thalassemia serum transferrin concentrations revealed slightly decreased results, whereas serum ferritin and iron concentrations demonstrated a tendency towards higher values if compared with the group of reference subjects. At a definitive MCV level, the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes is decreased in the case of IDA if compared with the alpha- or beta- thalassemia trait. For the ratio of hemoglobin content of reticulocytes and erythrocytes, obviously decreased results are demonstrated in the case of subjects with iron deficiency anemia (1.02 +/- 0.08, mean +/- SD) and in the case of beta-thalassemia (1.06 +/- 0.04) if compared with the group of reference subjects (1.11 +/- 0.02) and a-thalassemia (1.11 +/- 0.07). Evaluation of the hemoglobinization state should be performed by means of pattern recognition in concordance with characteristic profiles for parameters reflecting the actual iron state. In case of therapy the result of intervention can be appropriately monitored by longitudinal follow-up.},

The mean birthweight decreased from 2,723 g (1947 to 1968) to 2,494 g (1994 to 2000), the mean gestational age decreased from 39 weeks (1947 to 1968) to 37 weeks (1994 to 2000). The number of patients with associated congenital malformations increased from 34% (1947 to 1968) to 66% (1994 to 2000). Most patients underwent primary repair of their atresia. Clinically significant tracheomalacia was present in 34 of 269 patients (13%). Gastroesophageal reflux was present in 90 of 277 patients (33%). Mortality decreased from 61% (1947 to 1968) to 11% (1994 to 2000). The patients who are treated nowadays for esophageal atresia in a pediatric surgical center are born earlier, weigh less, and have more associated anomalies than those treated 50 years ago. Still, the mortality rate is much lower thanks to earlier diagnosis, better supportive care and improved surgical techniques. Therefore, further significant reduction will be difficult to achieve.},

  abstract = {Inhibitory Learning Theory (ILT) framework implies that in-session distress variability may promote extinction learning and thereby enhance exposure therapy efficacy. Thus far, research has mainly focused on in-session distress reduction. The aim of the current study was to assess whether in-session distress variability predicts next session PTSD symptom decline in PTSD patients receiving prolonged exposure (PE). Eighty-six patients with PTSD received 14 to 16 sessions of PE. Using dynamic panel models, we assessed the temporal relation (i.e., within-persons) between in-session distress variability and PTSD symptom decline. Moreover, we assessed the averaged relation (i.e., between-persons) between in-session distress variability and PTSD symptom decline. Temporal analyses showed that in-session distress variability did not precede PTSD symptom improvement. Averaged analyses showed that distress variability was related to PTSD symptom improvement. The operationalization of distress variability appeared to deviate from its theoretical conceptualization. In absence of distress reduction, distress variability can vary. However, our findings suggest that in-session distress variability does not drive symptom reduction during PE. In contrast, averaged over participants, distress variability was related to symptom improvement, suggesting that those with a more variable distress pattern across sessions show better treatment response. More empirical work is needed to shed light on the effect of distress variability during exposure sessions on treatment outcome and to offer grounds for clinical recommendations.},

It is concluded that the overall reliability of results for coagulation analytes can be considerably improved by drawing blood samples in triplicate and subsequent rejection of samples with inappropriate reproducibility for thrombin-antithrombin. Routine parameters like prothrombin time or activated partial thromboplastin time in normal conditions are not susceptible for the phenomenon of coagulation activation.},

  abstract = {Secretion of cytokines by monocytes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dialysis-related morbidity. Cytokine generation is presumed to take place in two steps: induction of mRNA transcription for cytokines by C5a and direct membrane contact, followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced translation of mRNA (priming/second signal theory, Kidney Int 37: 85-93, 1990). However, the in vitro conditions on which this theory was based differed markedly from clinical dialysis. To test this postulate for routine hemodialysis, 13 patients were studied cross-over with high-flux cuprammonium (CU), cellulose triacetate (CTA), and polysulfon dialyzers, using standard bicarbonate dialysate, as well as CTA with filtered dialysate (fCTA). Besides leukocytes, C3a, C5a, and limulus amebocyte lysate reactivity, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-1RA, soluble TNF receptors, and IL-1 beta mRNA were assessed. Only during dialysis with CU did C5a increase significantly (561 to 8185 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Endotoxin content of standard bicarbonate was higher than filtered dialysate (median, 24.3 and < 5 pg/ml respectively, P = 0.002), whereas limulus amebocyte lysate reactivity was not detected in the blood, except in the case of CU. TNF-alpha levels were elevated before, and remained stable during, dialysis, independent of the modality used. IL-1 beta, IL-6, and mRNA coding for IL-1 beta could not be demonstrated. IL-1RA and soluble TNF receptors (p55/p75) were markedly elevated compared with normal control subjects, but showed no differences between fCTA and CTA. To summarize, no evidence was found for production and release of cytokines by monocytes during clinical high-flux bicarbonate hemodialysis, neither with complement-activating membranes nor with unfiltered dialysate. Therefore, this study sheds some doubt on the relevance of the "priming/second signal" theory for clinical practice. The data presented suggest that reluctance to prescribe the use of high-flux dialyzers, as advocated in many reports, may not be warranted.},

However, this process might also be estimated by the assessment of cell surface markers. In this study, the relationship between the expression of PMN degranulation markers (CD63 and CD66b) and the release of degranulation products [myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoferrin (LF)] was investigated during clinical HD in order to evaluate cell surface markers as a useful index of PMN degranulation. The expression of CD63 and CD66b on PMN and the release of MPO and LF were investigated in 10 chronic HD patients, during both heparin (HDhep) and trisodium citrate anticoagulation (HDcit), in a randomized order. Samples were drawn from both the efferent and afferent lines of the dialyzer at 0, 7.5, and 180 min. During HDhep at first passage, a major increase in MPO (from 158 +/- 32 to 448 +/- 177 microg/l, p = 0.001) and LF (from 134 +/- 52 to 260 +/- 120 microg/l, p = 0.01) was found across the dialyzer, whereas marked changes were not observed during HDcit. The expression of CD63 and CD66b increased across the dialyzer during both anticoagulation modalities, but was only significant in the case of HDhep (CD63: mean fluorescence intensity from 247 +/- 61 to 331 +/- 118, p < 0.01; CD66b: mean fluorescence intensity from 340 +/- 76 to 434 +/- 103, p = 0.01). During HDhep a correlation was noted between the degranulation products and markers of both azurophilic and specific granules (MPO and CD63: r = 0.35; p < 0.01; LF and CD66b: r = 0.39, p < 0.01). Significant differences in the expression of CD63 and CD66b between HDhep and HDcit were not observed. When analyzing the combined data for both HDhep and HDcit, no correlation was observed between degranulation products and markers. Our data suggest that the measurements of cell surface markers may not be a reliable indicator of the degree of HD-induced PMN degranulation.},

Our aim was to assess the longitudinal course of suicidal ideation, and to identify predictors of persistent suicidal ideation. We used data from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA). We performed a linear mixed-effects growth model analysis (n = 230 with current suicidal ideation at baseline) to assess the course of suicidal ideation over time (baseline through 2-, 4-, 6- and 9-year follow-up). We used logistic regression analysis (n = 195) to test whether factors previously associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation in the literature (insomnia, hopelessness, loneliness, borderline personality traits, childhood trauma, negative life events) also predict persistence of suicidal ideation (i.e., reporting ideation at two consecutive assessment points, 6- and 9-years). We controlled for socio-demographics, clinical diagnosis and severity, medication use, and suicide attempt history. Suicidal ideation decreased over time, and this decrease became slower with increasing time, with the majority of symptom reductions occurring in the first two years of follow-up. More severe insomnia and hopelessness were associated with increased odds of persistent suicidal ideation, and hopelessness was a significant mediator of the relationship between insomnia and persistent suicidal ideation. Findings may not generalize to those with more severe suicidal ideation due to dropout of those with the worst clinical profile. Targeting insomnia and hopelessness in treatment may be particularly important to prevent the persistence of suicidal ideation.},

However, since biocompatibility originates inside the dialyzer, white blood cells (WBC) adhering to the dialyzer are probably most subject to the influence of both dialyzer membrane and dialysate. In order to collect membrane-adherent cells, a reliable and reproducible elution technique was developed. After 3 h of HD, blood was returned to the patient with 0.9% NaCl. Then, dialyzers were eluted by recirculation of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS/3 mM EDTA for 20 min, with or without prior flushing with 200 ml PBS. Finally, remaining adherent cells were collected by an afterwash with 10% trypsin. These solutions, as well as blood samples, were analyzed for WBC count, viability and differentiation. Random eluate samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the influence of elution on PMN activation was tested in a separate control experiment. WBC numbers decreased by flushing before elution, whereas cell numbers were maximal after elution with PBS/3 mM EDTA (30 x 10(6)). Trypsin afterwash resulted in a further yield of 12 x 10(6) cells. The eluates contained 81% PMN (blood 68%, p < 0.01), with a degranulated appearance, and only 12% lymphocytes (blood 21%, p < 0.05); cell viability in the eluates was > 95%. The eluted cells could be analyzed by flow cytometry, and the procedure itself induced only minimal PMN activation. In conclusion, a maximal number of adherent cells, consisting mainly of PMN, was obtained by direct elution with PBS/3 mM EDTA. The method itself did not induce marked PMN activation, and the cells obtained were suitable for further investigations, including flow cytometry.},

The recently introduced Sysmex XN2000 analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan) offers 3 methods for platelet counting: impedance (PLT-I), optical (PLT-O), and a new fluorescence method (PLT-F). The precision of the PLT-F method in blood samples with platelet counts less than 50 × 10(3)/μL (50 × 10(9)/L) was investigated and compared with the ICSH CD61-ImmunoPLT reference method. For comparison, PLT-I and PLT-O were determined on the Sysmex XN2000 and Sysmex XE2100 analyzer. Blood samples with platelet counts less than 50 × 10(3)/μL (50 × 10(9)/L) (n = 37) were analyzed on the Sysmex XN2000 and XE2100 analyzers. The CD61-ImmunoPLT method was performed on a Beckman Coulter FC-500 flow cytometer (Miami, FL). At a platelet count of 20 × 10(3)/μL (20 × 10(9)/L), reproducibility for PLT-I, PLT-O, and PLT-F on the XN2000 demonstrated coefficients of variation of 9.3%, 8.5%, and 3.0%, respectively. Correlation between PLT-O on the XN2000 and XE2100 yielded an r value of more than 0.977. Linear regression analysis between the PLT-F and CD61-ImmunoPLT methods resulted in a PLT-F of 0.71*CD61 - 0.8 (r = 0.988). Linear regression between PLT-F and PLT-O on the XN2000 resulted in a PLT-F of 1.05*PLT-O - 2 (r = 0.975), and using the transfusion threshold of 20 × 10(9)/L platelets resulted in a PLT-F of 0.90*PLT-O - 0.4 (r = 0.956). The new PLT-F method demonstrated excellent results for reproducibility in samples with platelet counts less than 50 × 10(9)/L.

The World Health Organization suggested a Hb concentration of 110 g/L to discriminate anemia. Several European investigators recommended Hb cut-off values of between 101-110 g/L. The aim of this study was to establish short-term effects of iron supplementation on the hemoglobin content of reticulocytes (Ret-He) and red blood cells (RBC-He) in case of suspected iron deficient erythropoiesis (IDE) in the third trimester of pregnancy. Twenty-five subjects with suspected IDE during pregnancy (Hb ≤110g/L, Ret-He <29.6 pg, zinc protoporphyrin >75 mol/mol hem) participated in the study. After iron supplementation, reticulocyte counts increased from 0.061±0.015×10(12)/L to 0.079±0.026×10(12)/L and Ret-He increased from 23.6±2.8 pg to 28.3±2.6 pg (P=<0.001). RBC-He increased from 26.9±1.9 pg to 27.4±1.8 pg (not significant, NS) and Ret-He/RBC-He ratio increased from 0.97±0.06 towards 1.07±0.05 (P=<0.001).

An obvious increase in RBC distribution width was observed from 45.0±3.6 fL towards 52.3±7.0 fL (P≤0.001). We recommend that Ret-He and Ret-He/RBC-He ratio be integrated into the protocols for anemia screening and for monitoring effects of iron supplementation during pregnancy. In particular, the parameters should be considered in subjects with Hb results in the controversial range of 101-108 g/L.},

A total of 25 patients with CAP participated in the study. The assay for serum hepcidin-25 is based on a combination of weak cation exchange chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. At hospital admission serum hepcidin-25 concentrations (14.6 ± 6.9 nMol/L, mean ± SD) were established in the upper level of the reference range (0.5-13.9 nMol/L). Results for C-reactive protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were obviously increased compared to the reference ranges. From admission until day 14 hepcidin-25, CRP and IL-6 steadily decreased towards the reference ranges. Hb concentrations declined from admission until day 4 from 8.1 ± 1.0 mMol/L to 7.4 ± 0.9 mMol/L. At admission Ret-He results were within the lower region of the reference range (1900-2300aMol) and results demonstrated a decline during admission from 1931 ± 241 aMol until 1845 ± 199 aMol (NS) at day 4. From a minimum Ret-He value at day 4 results increased towards 2129 ± 136 aMol at day14. A transient increase of cytokine-stimulated serum hepcidin-25 in combination with a temporary decrease of Hb and Ret-He is demonstrated in patients with CAP.

Clinical and microbiologic response, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level (cutoffs 5 and 50 mg/L), and serum procalcitonin level (PCT) (cutoffs 0.1 and 0.25 μg) were assessed. Potential bacterial pathogens were identified in the majority of exacerbations (58%). We found a modest positive correlation between PCT and CRP (r = 0.46, P < .001). The majority of patients (75%) had low PCT levels, with mostly elevated CRP levels. Although CRP levels were higher in the presence of bacteria (median, 33.0 mg/L [interquartile range, 9.75-88.25] vs 17 mg/L [interquartile range, 5.0-61.0] [P = .004]), PCT levels were similar. PCT and CRP performed similarly as markers of clinical success, and we found a clinical success rate of 90% in patients with CRP ≤ 5 mg/L. A significant effect of doxycycline was observed in patients with a PCT level < .1 μg/L (treatment effect, 18.4%; P = .003). A gradually increasing treatment effect of antibiotics (6%, 10%, and 18%), although not significant, was found for patients with CRP values of ≤ 5, 6-50, and > 50 mg/L, respectively.

  abstract = {Early identification of patients with mental health problems in need of highly specialised care could enhance the timely provision of appropriate care and improve the clinical and cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies. Recent research on the development and psychometric evaluation of diagnosis-specific decision-support algorithms suggested that the treatment allocation of patients to highly specialised mental healthcare settings may be guided by a core set of transdiagnostic patient factors. To develop and psychometrically evaluate a transdiagnostic decision tool to facilitate the uniform assessment of highly specialised mental healthcare need in heterogeneous patient groups. The Transdiagnostic Decision Tool was developed based on an analysis of transdiagnostic items of earlier developed diagnosis-specific decision tools. The Transdiagnostic Decision Tool was psychometrically evaluated in 505 patients with a somatic symptom disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder. Feasibility, interrater reliability, convergent validity and criterion validity were assessed. In order to evaluate convergent validity, the five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the ICEpop CAPability measure for Adults (ICECAP-A) were administered. The six-item clinician-administered Transdiagnostic Decision Tool demonstrated excellent feasibility and acceptable interrater reliability. Spearman's rank correlations between the Transdiagnostic Decision Tool and ICECAP-A (-0.335), EQ-5D-5L index (-0.386) and EQ-5D-visual analogue scale (-0.348) supported convergent validity. The area under the curve was 0.81 and a cut-off value of ≥3 was found to represent the optimal cut-off value. The Transdiagnostic Decision Tool demonstrated solid psychometric properties and showed promise as a measure for the early detection of patients in need of highly specialised mental healthcare.},

  abstract = {Haemostatic changes may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of ulcerative colitis. We studied longitudinally inflammatory and haemostatic parameters in patients treated for severe ulcerative colitis. We carried out a descriptive study of longitudinal blood measurements in patients with severe ulcerative colitis from one large regional hospital. Nineteen patients with severe ulcerative colitis were assessed by an endoscopic score and a patient score at baseline. Patients were assessed by patient scores during treatment at scheduled intervals. At each visit, inflammatory and haemostatic parameters were determined. At baseline, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, leucocyte and granulocyte count, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, prothrombin fragment 1+2, fibrinogen and degradation products of fibrinogen and fibrin were increased in patients when compared with controls, whereas albumin concentration and factor XIII activity were significantly lower. Antithrombin activity was normal. During treatment, the median patient score diminished significantly from 12 to 4.5 points after 2 weeks, decreased further to 4 points after 4 weeks and remained below 4 points throughout the remaining study period. Inflammation parameters returned to within the reference range in two patients after 4 weeks, whereas the coagulation markers prothrombin fragment 1+2 and thrombin-antithrombin complexes returned to normal values after 8 weeks and 24 weeks, respectively. In contrast with markers of inflammation, slightly increased concentrations of the degradation products of both fibrinogen and fibrin were found for almost 1 year, which indicated low-grade activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. These results are compatible with a condition of persistent hypercoagulation in patients with ulcerative colitis who are in clinical remission. Persistent hypercoagulation may contribute to the clinical course of ulcerative colitis.},

Non-survivors had higher D-dimer levels (3025 ± 2105 versus 1680 ± 1128 μg/l, p=0.05). None of the 16 patients with D-dimer levels<500 μg/l died. In multivariate analysis D-dimer levels were not associated with clinical outcome. D-dimer levels have poor accuracy for predicting clinical outcome at day 30 (AUC 0.62, 95% CI 0.51-0.73) or 30 day mortality (AUC 0.71 (95% CI 0.51-0.91)). Addition of D-dimer levels to CURB-65 did not increase accuracy. No differences were observed in serial D-dimer levels between patients with clinical success or failure at day 30. D-dimer levels are elevated in patients with CAP. Significantly higher D-dimer levels are found in patients with clinical failure and with severe CAP. D-dimer levels as single biomarker or as addition to the CURB-65 have no added value for predicting clinical outcome or mortality. D-dimer levels<500 μg/l may identify candidates at low risk for complications.},

Particularly in the Hb range between 101-110 g/L it is difficult to determine whether the decreased haemoglobin concentration is physiological or pathological and whether supplementation is required. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the added value of measuring the percentages of microcytic RBCs (%MicroR) and hypochromic RBCs (%Hypo-He) for monitoring effects of iron supplementation in case of suspected iron-deficient erythropoiesis (IDE) in the third trimester of pregnancy. After assessing haematological parameters and zinc protoporphyrin/heme ratio as marker for IDE, subjects were classified into a group with symptoms of IDE (n = 39) or without IDE (n = 106). The subjects with IDE (n = 39) were treated with iron supplementation. After 4 weeks effects of treatment were evaluated. In the group of pregnant women with IDE results of %MicroR and %Hypo-He were increased (p = <.001), compared to the group without haematological symptoms of IDE, whereas RET-He, RBC-He and delta-He were decreased (p = <.001). A significant positive correlation to increased values of %MicroR (r = .75, p = <.001) and %Hypo-He (r = .77, p = <.001) with ZPP was established. However, in the ZPP interval 75-100 μmol/mol heme a slight overlap was demonstrated between subjects with and without symptoms of IDE. After iron supplementation, %Hypo-He decreased (p = .002) while %MicroR remained stable. RET-He, delta-He and RDW-SD increased (p = <.001). The added value of %MicroR and %Hypo-He as a single marker for IDE is poor. However, combined interpretation of %MicroR, %Hypo-He, Ret-He and delta-He has added value in monitoring erythropoiesis during pregnancy.},

  abstract = {The sum of undesirable side effects, occurring during haemodialysis (HD), is called bio-incompatibility. Concerning platelets, both an increase in the expression of the cell surface marker P-selectin (CD62p) and release of the intracellular granule product platelet factor 4 (PF4) have been described. However, as PF4 is also abundantly present on endothelium-bound proteoglycans, it is questionable whether the HD-induced increase is exclusively attributable to release from platelets. With respect to the cause of HD-induced bio-incompatibility, interest has been focused mainly on the extracorporeal circuit (ECC), especially the dialyser, whereas only little attention has been paid to other parts of the ECC and the mode of anticoagulation applied. To address the cause and origin of platelet activation and PF4 release during clinical HD, two complementary clinical studies were performed. In study I, the relative influence of the various parts of the ECC was evaluated by measuring the expression of CD62p, platelet aggregation and levels of PF4 and serotonin at various sampling points. In study II, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) was administered 10 min before the actual start of HD, in order to separate the effects from LMWH and the ECC on platelet activation. In study I, CD62p expression increased across the entire length of the ECC, including the roller pump and dialyser (median at t(5) from 26% to 43%, P = 0.008; median at t(30) from 28% to 48%, P = 0.007). Increments in PF4 and aggregation of platelets were relatively modest. Platelet serotonin content, which was below reference values in healthy controls, and plasma serotonin concentration, which was above reference values, did not change. In study II, PF4 levels increased markedly after the injection of LMWH (from 12 IU/ml at t(-10) to 75 IU/ml at t(0), P = 0.018), whereas CD62p expression remained stable until the start of HD. Platelet activation, as measured by the up-regulation of CD62p, is an early process, occurring not only within the dialyser, but across the entire length of the ECC. As CD62p remained unaltered after the administration of LMWH 10 min before the actual start of HD, this kind of activation is independent of LMWH. Considering PF4 however, a sharp increment was observed after the administration of LMWH and before the start of HD. This finding suggests that the PF4 release observed early in clinical HD is largely independent from the ECC, and is probably the result of LMWH-induced detachment from the endothelium. As the platelet serotonin content was relatively reduced and the plasma serotonin levels were elevated, platelets from chronic HD patients might be depleted due to chronic repetitive activation. Based on these data, it appears first, that PF4 is an inferior marker of platelet activation in clinical HD and second, that LMWH is a major contributor to HD-induced bio-incompatibility.},

In ulcerative colitis, hypercoagulation is presumed, which may explain part of the clinical features of this disease. Therapy strategies affecting hemostasis may improve the course of ulcerative colitis. This study was conducted to evaluate the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis in the course of treatment of active ulcerative colitis. Patients with active ulcerative colitis were studied by serial determination of markers of the coagulation cascade (thrombin-antithrombin complexes and fibrin degradation products [FbDP]) and the fibrinolytic cascade (fibrinogen degradation products [FgDP]). Parameters of inflammation were also measured (C-reactive protein [CRP], erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], albumin, platelet count, and fibrinogen). Disease activity was assessed by endoscopic and histopathological scores. Follow-up measurement was performed in the course of treatment at the third or fourth month after baseline. Measurements were compared with healthy controls. Thirty-three patients and 22 healthy controls were included. During active ulcerative colitis, inflammatory parameters (CRP, ESR, platelet count) and hemostatic parameters (thrombin-antithrombin complexes, fibrinogen, FgDP, and FbDP) were elevated in comparison with healthy controls. Albumin was decreased and antithrombin-III remained unchanged. During treatment, disease activity decreased significantly endoscopically and histopathologically (p < 0.001). CRP, ESR, platelet count, and fibrinogen also decreased significantly. The hemostatic balance, expressed as the ratio between the plasmin-dependent generation of FgDP and coagulation-dependent generation of FbDP, increased from 0.69 to 1.12 during treatment, mainly because of a decrease of FbDP. In healthy controls, this ratio was The coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades were activated in active ulcerative colitis, with a hemostatic imbalance in favor of coagulation. This hypercoagulability persisted in 20% (7/33) of patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. The decrease of FbDP and the increase in the FgDP/FbDP ratio during reconvalescence of ulcerative colitis showed that the coagulation cascade was more activated than the fibrinolytic cascade in active disease.},

Since then, two updated versions were published. Based on recent scientific developments and experience with SimpleBox 3.0, a new version of SimpleBox was developed and is made public here: SimpleBox 4.0. In this new model, eight major changes were implemented: removal of the local scale and vegetation compartments, addition of lake compartments and deep ocean compartments (including the thermohaline circulation), implementation of intermittent rain instead of drizzle and of depth dependent soil concentrations, adjustment of the partitioning behavior for organic acids and bases as well as of the value for enthalpy of vaporization. In this paper, the effects of the model changes in SimpleBox 4.0 on the predicted steady-state concentrations of chemical substances were explored for different substance groups (neutral organic substances, acids, bases, metals) in a standard emission scenario. In general, the largest differences between the predicted concentrations in the new and the old model are caused by the implementation of layered ocean compartments. Undesirable high model complexity caused by vegetation compartments and a local scale were removed to enlarge the simplicity and user friendliness of the model.},

In 11 patients, IL-6, CRP and sPLA(2) levels were assessed in blood samples drawn before (t(0)), at the end (t(180)) and 24 h after the start of HD (t(1440)). All patients were dialysed on Cuprammonium (CU) and Polysulphon (PS) dialysers and seven patients underwent an additional HD session on CU plus a dialysate filter (CUf). IL-6 levels were increased significantly at t(180) compared with t(0) (P<0.02) with both CU and CUf. At t(1440), IL-6 levels had returned to baseline. In contrast, marked fluctuations did not occur during HD with PS. At t(180), IL-6 was significantly greater with CU and CUf devices, than with PS (P<0.02). Following HD with CU and CUf, a significant increase in CRP was observed at t(1440), compared with postdialysis values (P</=0.05). In addition, sPLA(2) values were markedly increased at t(1440), compared with t(180), but only significant in the case of CU (P=0.01). IL-6 levels at t(180) were significantly correlated with CRP (r=0.50, P<0.01) and sPLA(2) (r=0.47, P=0.01) values at t(1440). During HD with PS membranes, neither CRP nor sPLA(2) values were markedly changed. In contrast to PS, both CU and CUf resulted in elevated IL-6 plasma levels at the end of HD, compared with t(0), which correlated with increased CRP and sPLA(2) values 24 h later. Therefore, the type of membrane, rather than the bacterial quality of the dialysate, seems to be responsible for the induction of the acute phase response during clinical bicarbonate HD.},

Within 24 h after admission, Ret-He results are situated within the lower quartile region of the reference range interval. Until day 4 of hospital admission, a steady trend towards a decline of 3-8% is established.

However, no single marker or combination of tests is optimal for discrimination between iron-deficiency anemia and thalassemia. This is the reason why many algorithms have been introduced. However, application of conventional algorithms, only resulted in appropriate classification of 30-40% of subjects. In this mini-review the efficacy of innovative hematological parameters for detection of alterations in RBCs has been considered. It refers to parameters concerning hemoglobinization of RBCs and reticulocytes and the percentages microcytic and hypochromic RBCs, for discrimination between subjects with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) or thalassemia as well as a combination of both. A new discriminating tool including the above mentioned parameters was developed, based on two precondition steps and discriminating algorithms. The percentage microcytic RBCs is considered in the first precondition step. MCV, RDW-SD and RBC count are applied in the second precondition step. Subsequently, new algorithms, including conventional as well as innovative hematological parameters, were assessed for subgroups with microcytic erythropoiesis. The new algorithms for IDA discrimination yielded results for sensitivity of 79%, specificity of 97%, positive and negative predictive values of 74% and 98% respectively. The algorithms for β-thalassemia discrimination revealed similar results (74%, 98%, 75% and 99% respectively). We advocate that innovative algorithms, including parameters reflecting hemoglobinization of RBCs and reticulocytes, are integrated in an easily accessible software program linked to the hematology equipment to improve the discrimination between IDA and thalassemia.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Platelet (PLT) dysfunction, which is a well-known phenomenon in advanced chronic renal failure, corresponds positively with CVD in these patients. The accumulation of retained uraemic toxins might play an important role in this respect. During haemodialysis (HD), both an increase in the expression of the platelet (PLT) cell surface molecule P-selectin (CD62p) and the release of intra-granular substances, such as platelet factor 4 (PF4) and ss-thromboglobulin (BTG), have been described. As the removal of uraemic toxins is superior during haemodiafiltration (HDF), this form of treatment may have quite another impact on PLTs than HD. Nineteen chronic HD patients who were treated with low-flux HD for at least 2 months were included in the Dutch CONvective TRAnsport STudy (CONTRAST). After randomization, 10 patients continued low-flux HD and 9 patients switched to post-dilution HDF. The present study describes various parameters of PLT activation and degranulation at baseline (during HD) and after 3 months (during HDF) in the latter group of patients. At both time points, multiple blood samples were drawn. During the first 30 min of treatment, differences over the extracorporeal circuit (ECC) were calculated by taking samples from both afferent (arterial) and efferent (venous) lines. Correlations between various parameters were calculated in the total group of patients after 3 months. Immediately after the start of HD, PLT counts dropped over the ECC. During HDF, PLT counts decreased even more and reached a nadir at t30. CD62p expression increased early during HD and returned to baseline thereafter. During HDF, these changes were more pronounced and more protracted. With respect to degranulation, rather dissimilar results were obtained. During HD, both PF4 and BTG increased over time, whereas during HDF, PF4 increased but BTG did not change. Haemoconcentration and transmembrane pressure (TMP) within the dialyser were, respectively, approximately 10 and 3x higher during HDF than during HD. There was a striking correlation between the changes in haemoconcentration and the changes in both PLT counts and CD62p over the ECC. PLT activation, as measured by the expression of CD62p, was more pronounced and more protracted during HDF than during HD. During HDF, PLTs were trapped abundantly within the ECC, not only after first passage, but also thereafter. The degranulation product BTG increased during HD, but did not change during HDF. These observations may well be explained by the greater haemoconcentration and/or higher TMP during HDF on the one hand, and superior convective transport at the other. Whether the potential harmful effects of enhanced PLT activation are counterbalanced by the beneficial effects of an increased convective transport of degranulation products remains to be established.},

Although the effectiveness of CBT(-E) is clear, it is not being used as widely in clinical practice as guidelines recommend. The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of CBT-E with treatment as usual (TAU), which was largely based on CBT principles. We conducted a randomized controlled trial on a total of 143 adult patients with an ED who received either CBT-E or TAU. The primary outcome was recovery from the ED. Secondary outcome measures were levels of ED psychopathology, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Self-esteem, perfectionism, and interpersonal problems were repeatedly measured to examine possible moderating effects. We explored differences in duration and intensity between conditions. After 80 weeks, there were no differences between conditions in decrease in ED psychopathology, or symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, in the first six weeks of treatment there was a larger decrease in ED psychopathology in the CBT-E condition. Moreover, when the internationally most widely used definition of recovery was applied, the recovery rate at 20 weeks of CBT-E was significantly higher (57.7%) than of TAU (36.0%). At 80 weeks, this difference was no longer significant (CBT-E 60.9%; TAU 43.6%). Furthermore, CBT-E was more effective in improving self-esteem and was also the less intensive and shorter treatment. With broader use of CBT-E, the efficiency, accessibility and effectivity (on self-esteem) of treatment for EDs could be improved.},

  abstract = {Haemodialysis (HD)-induced bio-incompatibility includes alterations in both cellular elements and humoral factors. As far as polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells are concerned, an increase in both adhesion and degranulation has been reported. However, whereas increased PMN adherence and aggregation is highly linked with early transient complement activation, degranulation seems a continuous process, independent from the formation of complement degradation products. In the process of cell activation, including PMN degranulation, divalent cations (Ca2+) appear to play a pivotal role. As regionally administering citrate creates an almost Ca(2+)-free environment within the dialyser, it is tempting to speculate that Ca2+ dependent phenomena of bio-incompatibility, originating within the dialyser, can be attenuated by substituting conventional heparin for citrate. Therefore, both anticoagulation modalities were compared in 10 stable patients, undergoing haemodialysis (HD) treatment with cellulose-triacetate membranes (CTA) only. Apart from the intracellular granule products myeloperoxidase (MPO) and lactoferrin (LF), the classical parameters of bio-incompatibility, peripheral blood neutropenia and complement activation, were measured. Analysis of MPO and LF gradients across the dialyser (concentration in efferent line-concentration in afferent line) suggested that degranulation is an early process, that occurs mainly within the extracorporeal circuit. Citrate abolished the release of MPO almost completely, whereas LF release was partially inhibited. Neither neutropenia, nor complement activation could be correlated with the occurrence of degranulation. HD-induced PMN degranulation seems largely independent from complement activation, but primarily reliant on Ca2+, at least in the case of CTA membranes.},

To investigate peri-operative erythrocyte function and effects of oral omega-3 fatty acids in morbidly obese women undergoing gastric bypass surgeryMETHODS:Fifty-six morbidly obese women undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) surgery were randomized between a low calorie diet (LCD) during 2 weeks or oral omega-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and a normal diet during 4 weeks. Peri-operative blood samples were analyzed with the Lorrca MaxSIS Ektacytometer for erythrocyte deformability and aggregability. There were no significant differences in erythrocyte function between the groups at any time point. Only erythrocyte aggregability parameters were affected by surgery. At six month follow-up, aggregation index (AI) and cholesterol, glucose and insulin were significantly improved. In this study, oral Omega-3 supplementation did not affect erythrocyte function compared to a LCD. Six months after surgery a significant improvement in AI and metabolic parameters was observed in both groups, contributing to a reduction in the risk at thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications.},

In addition, platelet (PLT) abnormalities are common. In this minireview, we report on aspects of haemodialysis (HD)-induced PLT activation. It is demonstrated that PLTs from HD patients are exhausted due to repeated stimulation of HD treatment and recurrent release of PLT degranulation products. During HD, additional aberrations of the haemostatic process occur. Besides deviations of coagulation and fibrinolysis, PLT activation and a reduction in their granule content have been observed during HD treatment. As HD treatment is carried out three times per week, month after month, chronic HD patients may suffer persistently from coagulation defects and PLT disorders on top of the alterations induced by the uraemic state itself. PLT activation occurs together with thrombin and fibrin generation. However, macro fibrin depositions in clot devices are not demonstrated, microaggregates occur not only in the extracorporeal circuit (ECC) but are also present in the blood circulation. As vascular access thrombosis is a frequent complication in patients with HD treatment, it is believed that hypercoagulability could result from vascular changes combined with PLTs and activation of coagulation factors.},

In practice, verification is limited to comparison with the previously used equipment and determination of reproducibilities. Particularly in multicenter settings, harmonization of results is necessary. If the same equipment is used in several laboratory departments, calibration and uniformity are important issues. In this study, seven Sysmex XN hematology modules distributed over three laboratories were evaluated with the same set of samples (n=160). Results of each Sysmex XN hematology module were compared with the results of the Sysmex XE-2100 hematology analyzer using linear regression. Although excellent correlation coefficients were obtained, in many cases the criteria for slope and/or intercept were not met. Therefore, the same data were analyzed with Bland-Altman difference plots with three times the specified CV% of the parameter as limits of agreement. At least 90% of the determinations per parameter and per module must comply with those limits of agreement. Almost all parameters on each module fulfilled these criteria, and only RBC and Ht from respectively two and four XN modules had to be recalibrated. Reproducibility of each parameter was determined 10 times in patient samples with low, normal, and high levels. Reproducibility of all parameters was within the specifications of the manufacturer and the biological variability. With this straightforward method, all seven Sysmex XN hematology modules demonstrated uniform results, which were identical to those of the previously used Sysmex XE-2100 hematology analyzer, the performance of which was well known.},

A strong case for posttraumatic cognitions as a change mechanism in PTSD treatment can be made by establishing temporal precedence of change in cognitions. The current study examines the temporal relationship between change in posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD symptoms during PE, using the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory. Patients with DSM-5 defined PTSD following childhood abuse (N = 83) received a maximum of 14-16 sessions of PE. Clinician-rated PTSD symptom severity and posttraumatic cognitions were assessed at baseline, week 4, 8, and 16 (post-treatment). Using time-lagged mixed effect regression models, we found that posttraumatic cognitions predicted subsequent PTSD symptom improvement. Notably, when using the items of an abbreviated version of the PTCI (PTCI-9), we found a mutual relationship between posttraumatic cognitions and PTSD symptom improvement. Crucially, the effect of change in cognitions on PTSD symptom change was greater than the reverse effect. The current findings corroborate change in posttraumatic cognitions as a change process during PE, but cognitions and symptoms cannot be completely separated. The PTCI-9 is a short instrument that appears suitable to track cognitive change over time.},

Total bilirubin assayed by the manual diazobilirubin method showed no such effect.

Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following childhood abuse (CA-PTSD) may have challenges in building interpersonal relationships, including working alliance. Phase-based treatment provides an opportunity to strengthen alliance prior to trauma-focused treatment. This study aimed to compare the development of working alliance among patients with CA-PTSD in three variants of prolonged exposure (PE) therapy: standard PE, intensive PE (iPE), and skill training in affective and interpersonal regulation + prolonged exposure (STAIR + PE). We also examined the effect of alliance on treatment outcome and dropout. Self-reported PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (Blevins et al., 2015) and patient-rated Working Alliance Inventory (Tracey & Kokotovic, 1989) were assessed in a clinical trial. We analyzed data from 138 adult patients (76.1% female; 42% non-Western). Analyses were performed using mixed-effects models. Patients established a satisfactory alliance early in treatment, which increased over time. For PE and STAIR + PE, a larger decrease in PTSD symptom severity was related to a higher alliance in the subsequent session, but not the other way around. In STAIR + PE, a higher alliance in Phase 1 was related to lower PTSD symptoms in Phase 2. In all conditions, a higher initial working alliance was related to a lower chance of treatment dropout. In the treatment of CA-PTSD, all three variants of prolonged exposure foster positive development of the working alliance. Across conditions, working alliance did not precede symptom decline. Therapists should strive for a strong alliance at the beginning of treatment as this reduces the likelihood of dropout. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved).},

  abstract = {Screening for pseudothrombocytopenia caused by in vitro platelet clumping has been performed in 45,000 subjects attending a general hospital. In our region, the observed prevalence of EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia in blood samples with an initial platelet count below 150 x 10(9)/l was estimated to amount to 0.1%. EDTA-induced pseudothrombocytopenia was confirmed by detection of platelet aggregates by means of microscopic evaluation from the blood smear. In routine investigations, pseudothrombocytopenia could be highly suspected when the Sysmex NE 8000 showed characteristic peculiarities in the white blood cell (WBC) scattergram and histogram. Platelet aggregation is avoided in such cases by the use of citrate as an anticoagulant instead of EDTA. Pseudothrombocytopenia was detected in 46 subjects. As a screening test for pseudothrombocytopenia, increased cut-off values derived from the WBC histogram demonstrated 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Automated flagging for platelet clumps, deviations reflecting MPV, or PDW abnormalities revealed lower scores with respect to sensitivity.},

Recent studies in healthy participants suggest that attentional control (AC) may facilitate inhibition of automatic attentional processes associated with anxiety. To investigate relationships among AC, trauma-related AB, symptom severity and trait anxiety in patients with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), participants (N = 91) completed self-report measures of AC, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and trait anxiety. AB was measured with a pictorial version of the Dot Probe Test. AC moderated the relationship between PTSS and AB (threat avoidance). Patients high in PTSS and low in AC showed attentional avoidance. No association between PTSS and AB in patients with medium or high levels of AC was found. A similar pattern of results was observed for the relationship between trait anxiety, AC and AB. These results suggest that a low ability to control attention is a risk factor for AB in PTSD. This first clinical study corroborates the accumulating evidence from analog studies that individual differences in top-down attentional control are of considerable importance in the expression of AB in anxious psychopathology.},

It is currently unknown whether estradiol also interacts with orexigenic compounds implicated in the physiological control of food intake. Thus, the primary goal of this study was to determine whether estradiol decreases the orexigenic effect of melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), a neuropeptide that, like estradiol, appears to influence food intake by selectively affecting the controls of meal size. Food and water intake were monitored following lateral ventricular (icv) infusions of 5 mug MCH or saline vehicle in oil- and estradiol-treated ovariectomized rats. MCH increased food intake throughout the first 4 h of the dark phase in oil-treated rats, but only for the last 2 h of the same 4-h interval in estradiol-treated rats. As a result, the orexigenic effect of MCH was significantly lower in estradiol-treated rats, relative to oil-treated rats. During this interval of MCH-stimulated feeding, a prandial increase in water intake was not observed in either oil- or estradiol-treated rats. We conclude that estradiol decreases the orexigenic effect of MCH in ovariectomized rats.},

We sought to determine whether epigenetic changes in a peripheral tissue can serve as a surrogate for those in a relatively inaccessible tissue such as the brain. DNA extracted from the hippocampus and blood of mice treated with GCs or vehicle solution was assayed using a genome-wide DNAm platform (Methyl-Seq) to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) induced by GC treatment. We observed that ∼70% of the DMRs in both tissues lost methylation following GC treatment. Of the 3,095 DMRs that mapped to the same genes in both tissues, 1,853 DMRs underwent DNAm changes in the same direction. Interestingly, only 209 DMRs (<7%) overlapped in genomic coordinates between the 2 tissues, suggesting tissue-specific differences in GC-targeted loci. Pathway analysis showed that the DMR-associated genes were members of pathways involved in metabolism, immune function, and neurodevelopment. Also, changes in cell type composition of blood and brain were examined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Separation of the cortex into neuronal and non-neuronal fractions and the leukocytes into T-cells, B-cells, and neutrophils showed that GC-induced methylation changes primarily occurred in neurons and T-cells, with the blood tissue also undergoing a shift in the proportion of constituent cell types while the proportion of neurons and glia in the brain remained stable. From the current pilot study, we found that despite tissue-specific epigenetic changes and cellular heterogeneity, blood can serve as a surrogate for GC-induced changes in the brain.},

We tested this by treating passive and proactive rats (Roman Low Avoidance and Roman High Avoidance rats respectively) with either Rosiglitazone or with RU486. After eight days of treatment we performed and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and we compared the insulin and glucose levels with those measured during the IVGTT at baseline. Rosiglitazone improved insulin levels during an IVGTT in both passive and proactive coping styles. RU486, however, lowered insulin levels only in rats with a passive coping style. This study suggests that insight in the neuroendocrine differences between passive and proactive coping styles may provide an extra impulse to improve treatment of insulin resistance, since it allows the application of drugs targeted at the individual.},

A standardized calvaria implantation model was applied for 2, 8, and 16 weeks on Wistar rats to test the interactions between the barrier membrane and the underlying bone defects which were filled with bovine bone substitute materials (BSM). In an effort to understand the barrier membrane's bioactivity, deeper histochemical analyses, as well as the immunohistochemical detection of macrophage subtypes (M1/M2) and vascular endothelial cells, were conducted and combined with histomorphometric and statistical approaches. The native collagen-based membrane was found to have ossified due to its potentially osteoconductive and osteogenic properties, forming a "bony shield" overlying the bone defects. Histomorphometrical evaluation revealed the resorption of the membranes and their substitution with bone matrix. The numbers of both M1- and M2-macrophages were significantly higher within the membrane compartments compared to the underlying bone defects. Thereby, M2-macrophages significantly dominated the tissue reaction within the membrane compartments. Statistically, a correlation between M2-macropahges and bone regeneration was only found at 2 weeks post implantationem, while the pro-inflammatory limb of the immune response correlated with the two processes at 8 weeks. Altogether, this study elaborates on the increasingly described correlations between barrier membranes and the underlying bone regeneration, which sheds a light on the understanding of the immunomodulatory features of biomaterials.},

We tested the hypothesis that ENaC within the cardiac sensory network are mandatory for mechanosensation. Experiments were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats, isolated nodose ganglion cells with cardiac afferents and isolated vagus nerves. Epicardial delivery of the amiloride analogue benzamil intended to specifically inhibit ENaC presumably located on cardiac sensory afferents indeed blunted the mechanosensitive (i. e., sympathoinhibition by intravenous volume loading [-32% and -42% in treated groups vs. -67% in controls; n = 7 each; p < 0.05]) as well as-though to a lesser extent-the 5-HT(3)-mediated chemosensitive cardiorenal reflex in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Using patch clamp technique, however, it turned out that neither amiloride nor benzamil influenced mechanically induced currents in ganglion nodosum cells in vitro, stimulated by hypoosmotic stress. The unspecific stretch activated ion channel blocker gadolinium completely abolished mechanically induced currents, indicating respective cells were mechanosensitive. In isolated vagus nerves benzamil impaired action potentials obtained by electrical stimulation (C-spike amplitude [-33%]; latency [+12%]; n = 8; p < 0.05). Our findings at least cast doubt on ENaC exclusively playing a specific role as mechanotransducers within the cardiac sensory network. Other ion channels might be involved. Furthermore the observed findings in vivo could also be due to unspecific disturbance of afferent signal conduction.},

The aim of this study was the evaluation of the long-term degradation behavior and osseointegration of Mg-Ca-Zn (ZX00MEO) based magnesium implants with plasma-electrolytic oxidation (PEO) surface modification (ZX00MEO-PEO) in comparison to non-surface modified implants in vivo and in vitro. Besides a general evaluation of the biological performance of the alloy over a prolonged period, the main hypothesis was that PEO surface modification significantly reduces implant degradation rate and improves tissue interaction. In vitro, the microstructure and surface of the bioabsorbable screws were characterized by SEM/EDS, cytocompatibility and degradation testing facilitating hydrogen gas evolution, carried out following ISO 10993-5/-12 and ASTM F3268-18a/ASTM G1-03 (E1:2017). In vivo, screws were implanted in the frontal bone of Minipigs for 6, 12, and 18 months, following radiological and histomorphometric analysis. A slower and more uniform degradation and improved cytocompatibility could be shown for the ZX00MEO-PEO group in vitro. A significant reduction of degradation rate and enhanced bone formation around the ZX00MEO-PEO screws in vivo was confirmed. Proficient biocompatibility and tissue integration could generally be shown in vivo regardless of surface state. The tested magnesium alloy shows generally beneficial properties as an implant material, while PEO-surface modification further improves the bioabsorption behavior both in vitro and in vivo. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Devices from bioabsorbable Magnesium have recently been introduced to orthopedic applications. However, the vast degradation of Magnesium within the human body still gives limitations. While reliable in-vivo data on most promising surface treatments such as Plasma-electrolytic-Oxidation is generally scarce, long-time results in large animals are to this date completely missing. To overcome this lack of evidence, we studied a Magnesium-Calzium-Zinc-alloy with surface enhancement by PEO for the first time ever over a period of 18 months in a large animal model. In-vitro, surface-modified screws showed significantly improved cytocompatibility and reduction of degradation confirmed by hydrogen gas evolution testing, while in-vivo radiological and histological evaluation generally showed good biocompatibility and bioabsorption as well as significantly enhanced reduction of degradation and faster bone regeneration in the PEO-surface-modified group.},

Forty patients were divided into two study groups. Both groups received a xenogeneic bone substitute material (BSM) during lateral sinus augmentation. In the bony wall group (BW), following piezosurgery, the retrieved bony wall was repositioned. In the collagen membrane group (CM), following rotary instrument preparation, collagen membrane coverage was applied. After 6 months, biopsies were taken to histologically analyze the percentage of BSM, connective tissue (CT), and newly formed bone (NFB) following both approaches. Forty implants were placed and 29 harvested biopsies could be evaluated. Duration of surgery, membrane perforations, and VAS were detected. Histomorphometrical analysis revealed comparable amounts of all analyzed parameters in both groups in descending order: CT (BW: 39.2 ± 9%, CM: 37,9 ± 8.5%) > BSM (BW: 32.9 ± 6.3%, CM: 31.8 ± 8.8%) > NB (BW: 27.8 ± 11.2%, CM: 30.3 ± 4.5%). The results of the present study show that the closure of the access window by means of the retrieved bony wall or a native collagen membrane led to comparable bone augmentation results. clinicaltrials.gov NCT04811768. Lateral maxillary sinus augmentation with the application of a xenogeneic BSM in combination with a native collagen membrane for bony window coverage represents a reliable method for surgical reconstruction of the posterior maxilla.

The results of the IBS were compared to biphasic bone substitute granules (BBSM) of the same chemical composition. The subcutaneous implantation model in 40 female 5-week-old CD-1 mice up to 60 days after implantation was used for conduction of the in vivo experiments. Moreover, established histological, histopathological and histomorphometrical methods were applied. The results showed that the IBS was gradually invaded by cells and complex tissue elements. Thus, the implant bed could be distinguished in two areas, i.e. an outer and inner region. While the outer region started to interact with the peri-implant tissue by evoking multinucleated giant cells and at earlier time points by undergoing a continuous high vascularization, the inner part was free of peri-implant cells for at least 30 days, starting to undergo a similar tissue reaction at a later time point. The bone substitute granules allowed for a fast tissue influx between the interspaces of the granules starting at day 10. While the vessel density did not differ in both groups up to the end of the study, the amount of vascularization was significantly higher over the entire observation period in the BBSM group. Moreover, the amount of biomaterial-associated multinucleated giant cells (BMGCs) was significantly higher in the IBS group in the period of between 15 to 30 days after implantation, while comparable BMGC numbers were found in both groups towards the end of the study. IBS can build a barrier-like structure that is able to control the soft tissue influx into the central regions of the implantation bed, which could not be observed in other bone substitute granules of the same chemical composition. This directed integration behavior is assumed to be in accordance with the concept of Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR). Furthermore, BMGCs can significantly influence the process of angiogenesis within an implant bed of a biomaterial but not the maturity of blood vessels.},

Deciphering the regulation of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is paramount for understanding the cell tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ChIP-seq for activating histone marks and Pol II loading identified candidate enhancer elements controlling the ACE2 locus, including the intronic dACE2 promoter. Employing RNA-seq, we demonstrate that interferons activate expression of dACE2 and, to a lesser extent, the genuine ACE2 gene. Interferon-induced gene expression was mitigated by the JAK inhibitors baricitinib and ruxolitinib, used therapeutically in COVID-19 patients. Through integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data we provide an in-depth understanding of genetic programs activated by interferons, and our study highlights JAK inhibitors as suitable tools to suppress these in bronchial cells.},

This work describes a new method to produce thermoresponsive microgels with defined mechanical properties, surface morphologies, and volume phase transition temperatures. A wide variety of microgels is synthesized by crosslinking monomers or star polymers at different temperatures using thermally assisted microfluidics. The diversification of microgels with different network structures and morphologies but of chemical equivalence offers a new platform of microgel building blocks with the ability to undergo phase transition at physiological temperatures. The method holds high potential to create soft and dynamic materials while maintaining the chemical composition for a wide variety of applications in biomedicine.},

  abstract = {The degradation rate of magnesium (Mg) alloys is a key parameter to develop Mg-based biomaterials and ensure in vivo-mechanical stability as well as to minimize hydrogen gas production, which otherwise can lead to adverse effects in clinical applications. However, in vitro and in vivo results of the same material often differ largely. In the present study, a dynamic test bench with several single bioreactor cells was constructed to measure the volume of hydrogen gas which evolves during magnesium degradation to indicate the degradation rate in vivo. Degradation medium comparable with human blood plasma was used to simulate body fluids. The media was pumped through the different bioreactor cells under a constant flow rate and 37 °C to simulate physiological conditions. A total of three different Mg groups were successively tested: Mg WE43, and two different WE43 plasma electrolytically oxidized (PEO) variants. The results were compared with other methods to detect magnesium degradation (pH, potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), cytocompatibility, SEM (scanning electron microscopy)). The non-ceramized specimens showed the highest degradation rates and vast standard deviations. In contrast, the two PEO samples demonstrated reduced degradation rates with diminished standard deviation. The pH values showed above-average constant levels between 7.4-7.7, likely due to the constant exchange of the fluids. SEM revealed severe cracks on the surface of WE43 after degradation, whereas the ceramized surfaces showed significantly decreased signs of corrosion. PDP results confirmed the improved corrosion resistance of both PEO samples. While WE43 showed slight toxicity in vitro, satisfactory cytocompatibility was achieved for the PEO test samples. In summary, the dynamic test bench constructed in this study enables reliable and simple measurement of Mg degradation to simulate the in vivo environment. Furthermore, PEO treatment of magnesium is a promising method to adjust magnesium degradation.},

Alloying and surface modifications provide effective strategies for optimizing and tailoring their degradation kinetics. Nevertheless, biocompatibility analyses of Mg-based materials are challenging due to its special degradation mechanism with continuous hydrogen release. In this context, the hydrogen release and the related (micro-) milieu conditions pretend to strictly follow in vitro standards based on ISO 10993-5/-12. Thus, special adaptions for the testing of Mg materials are necessary, which have been described in a previous study from our group. Based on these adaptions, further developments of a test procedure allowing rapid and effective in vitro cytocompatibility analyses of Mg-based materials based on ISO 10993-5/-12 are necessary. The following study introduces a new two-step test scheme for rapid and effective testing of Mg. Specimens with different surface characteristics were produced by means of plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) using silicate-based and phosphate-based electrolytes. The test samples were evaluated for corrosion behavior, cytocompatibility and their mechanical and osteogenic properties. Thereby, two PEO ceramics could be identified for further in vivo evaluations.},

Moreover, cases with an up to 3-year follow-up were chosen to analyze the techniques of mid-term clinical success. Finally, the purification success of the FDBA was analyzed by means of established scanning electron microscopic (SEM) and histological methods. The FBDA bone ring was applied in three different patients and indications and presented; the healing success was analyzed on the basis of radiographical and clinical images. For analysis of the purification of the allogeneic bone, previously established histological methods and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were applied. All analyzed patient cases showed that the FDBA-based bone ring was fully integrated into newly built alveolar bone. Furthermore, the observations revealed that the three-dimensional bone reconstructions in maxilla and mandible were stable within the observational period of up to 3 years. Altogether, the present data show that the application of the Bone Ring Technique using the FDBA rings allows for successful regeneration of alveolar bone with a predictable clinical outcome, functionality and esthetics. Moreover, the material analyses showed that the allogeneic bone tissue was free of cells or cell remnants, while the (ultra-) structure of the bone matrix has been retained. Thus, the biological safety of the FDBA has been confirmed.},

Current epithelial lung models used to study respiratory viral infections include lung epithelial cells at the air-liquid interface (ALI) with fibroblasts and endothelial cells, but such models do not have a perfusable microvascular network to investigate both viral infectivity and viral infection-induced thrombotic events. Using a high throughput, 64-chip microfluidic plate-based platform, we have developed two novel vascularized, LRT multi-chip models for the alveoli and the small airway. Both models include a perfusable microvascular network consisting of human primary microvascular endothelial cells, fibroblasts and pericytes. The established biofabrication protocols also enable the formation of differentiated lung epithelial layers at the ALI on top of the vascularized tissue bed. We validated the physiologically relevant cellular composition, architecture and perfusion of the vascularized lung tissue models using fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and electrical resistance measurements.

The problem of the presence of the interference in the samples and system was successfully solved by careful optimization of chromatographic conditions. Charged hybrid stationary phase modified with pentafluorophenyl group and optimized gradient elution provided adequate separation selectivity and peak shapes. The impurity was identified as dibutyl phthalate and had the same m/z ions as farnesol leading to an important interference on selected reaction monitoring channel. Two different types of biological matrices originating from vaginal fluid, supernatant and sediment, were analysed. Micro-solid phase extraction in pipette tips was optimized for the selective isolation of QSM from the supernatant. The insufficient retention of farnesol on the extraction sorbent was improved when 1% of organic solvent was added prior to extraction, while the retention of tyrosol was only possible when using combined C8 and polymer sorbent type. Strong retention of farnesol had to be solved by increasing elution solvent strength and volume up to 600 μL. However, this approach did not allow the pretreatment of sediment samples due to the sorbent clogging. Therefore, our previously developed protein precipitation method was modified and validated to analyse the sediments. New developed UHPLC-MS/MS method provided suitable accuracy and precision for the determination of QSM in vaginal fluid while using only 50 μL sample volume and two different sample preparation methods.},

The enzymatic detection of the lytic enzyme tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) has manifoldly been used to examine the so-called "bioactivity" of BSM. The present study aimed to compare the detection validity and expression pattern of the TRAP enzyme using enzymatic and immunohistochemical detection methods in the context of biocompatibility analyses of BSM. Biopsies from 8 patients were analyzed after sinus augmentation with a xenogeneic bone substitute. Analysis of both macrophage and BMGC polarization were performed by histochemical TRAP detection and immunohistochemical detection of TRAP5a. Histomorphometrical analysis was used for comparison of the TRAP detection of BMGCs. The enzymatic TRAP detection method revealed that in 7 out of 8 biopsies only single cells were TRAP-positive, whereas most of the cells and especially the BMGCs were TRAP-negative. The immunohistochemical detection of TRAP5a showed moderate numbers of stained mononuclear cells, while the majority of the BMGCs showed signs of TRAP5a-expression. The enzymatic TRAP detection was comparable to the results obtained via immunohistochemistry only in one case. The histomorphometrical analysis showed that significantly more mononuclear and multinucleated TRAP-positive cells were found using immunohistochemical TRAP5a-staining compared to the enzymatic TRAP detection method. Also, significantly more TRAP-negative BMGCs were found using the enzymatic TRAP detection. The immunohistochemical detection of TRAP is more accurate for examination of the bioactivity and cellular degradability of BSM.},

  abstract = {Magnesium shows promising properties concerning its use in absorbable implant applications such as biodegradability, improved mechanical strength and plastic deformability. Following extensive research, the first fixation and compression screws composed of magnesium rare earth alloys were commercialised, notably in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Preclinical and clinical follow-up studies showed that the rapid degradation of unprotected metallic Magnesium surfaces and concomitant hydrogen gas bursts still raise concern regarding certain surgical indications and need to be further improved. In order to enlarge the scope of further applications, the development of future magnesium implants must aim at freedom of design and reduction of volume, hereby enabling higher functionalised implants, as e.g. plate systems or scaffold grafts for bone replacement therapy. In order to overcome the boundaries of conventional manufacturing methods such as turning or milling, the process of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) for magnesium alloys was recently introduced. It enables the production of lattice structures, therefore allowing for reduction of implant material volume. Nevertheless, the concomitant increase of free surface of such magnesium scaffolds further stresses the aforementioned disadvantages of vast degradation and early loss of mechanical stability if not prevented by suitable postprocessing methods. Magnesium scaffold structures with different pore sizes were therefore manufactured by LPBF and consequently further modified either by thermal heat treatment or Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO). Implant performance was assessed by conducting degradation studies and mechanical testing. PEO modified scaffolds with small pore sizes exhibited improved long-term stability, while heat treated specimens showed impaired performance regarding degradation and mechanical stability. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Magnesium based scaffold structures offer wide possibilities for advanced functionalized bioabsorbable implants. By implementing lattice structures, big implant sizes and mechanically optimized implant geometries can be achieved enabling full bone replacement or large-scale plate systems, e.g. for orthopedic applications. As shape optimization and lattice structuring of such scaffolds consequently lead to enlarged surface, suitable design and postprocessing routines come into focus. The presented study addresses these new and relevant topics for the first time by evaluating geometry as well as heat and surface treatment options as input parameters for improved chemical and mechanical stability. The outcome of these variations is measured by degradation tests and mechanical analysis. Evaluating these methods, a significant contribution to the development of absorbable magnesium scaffolds is made. The findings can help to better understand the interdependence of high surface to volume ratio Magnesium implants and to deliver methods to incorporate such lattice structures into future large-scale implant applications manufactured from bioabsorbable Magnesium alloys.},

The current study aimed to analyze the safety of renal biopsy in daily clinical practice as well as its usefulness regarding management of CKD after LT. We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data and renal biopsies obtained from patients with severe renal impairment (overt proteinuria, progressive deterioration of renal function) after LT with respect to safety, etiology of renal disease, and therapeutic consequences. Renal biopsies were obtained from 14 patients at median (minimum-maximum) 3 (0.2-12) years after LT. No major complications associated with renal biopsy were observed. Histomorphological alterations were varied (nephrosclerosis, n = 5; IgA-glomerulonephritis, n = 4; tenofovir-associated nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type 1, membranous glomerulonephritis, amyloid A amyloidosis, and calcineurin inhibitor nephropathy, n = 1, respectively). The diagnosis of specific renal diseases other than calcineurin-inhibitor nephrotoxicity facilitated specific treaments and avoided unnecessary modification of immunosuppression in the majority of patients. Renal biopsy in patients with CKD after LT seems safe and may offer specific therapeutic options. Furthermore, unnecessary changes of immunosuppression can be avoided in a considerable number of patients.},

HF-treated and untreated Mg were compared in direct and indirect cytocompatibility assays.

After 6, 12 and 18 weeks, Mg degradation and bone regeneration was measured using radiological and histological methods. In vitro, HF-treated Mg showed higher cytocompatibility. Histopathologically, HF-Mg prevented gas cavities and was degraded by mononuclear cells via phagocytosis up to 12 weeks. Untreated Mg showed partially significant more gas cavities and a fibrous tissue reaction. Bone regeneration was not significantly different between all groups. HF-Mg meshes embedded in native collagen membranes represent a volume stable and biocompatible alternative to the non-absorbable synthetic materials. HF-Mg shows less corrosion and is degraded by phagocytosis. However, the application of membranes did not result in higher bone regeneration.},

  abstract = {Collagen-based barrier membranes are an essential component in Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) procedures. They act as cell-occlusive devices that should maintain a micromilieu where bone tissue can grow, which in turn provides a stable bed for prosthetic implantation. However, the standing time of collagen membranes has been a challenging area, as native membranes are often prematurely resorbed. Therefore, consolidation techniques, such as chemical cross-linking, have been used to enhance the structural integrity of the membranes, and by consequence, their standing time. However, these techniques have cytotoxic tendencies and can cause exaggerated inflammation and in turn, premature resorption, and material failures. However, tissues from different extraction sites and animals are variably cross-linked. For the present in vivo study, a new collagen membrane based on bovine dermis was extracted and compared to a commercially available porcine-sourced collagen membrane extracted from the pericardium. The membranes were implanted in Wistar rats for up to 60 days. The analyses included well-established histopathological and histomorphometrical methods, including histochemical and immunohistochemical staining procedures, to detect M1- and M2-macrophages as well as blood vessels. Initially, the results showed that both membranes remained intact up to day 30, while the bovine membrane was fragmented at day 60 with granulation tissue infiltrating the implantation beds. In contrast, the porcine membrane remained stable without signs of material-dependent inflammatory processes. Therefore, the bovine membrane showed a special integration pattern as the fragments were found to be overlapping, providing secondary porosity in combination with a transmembraneous vascularization. Altogether, the bovine membrane showed comparable results to the porcine control group in terms of biocompatibility and standing time. Moreover, blood vessels were found within the bovine membranes, which can potentially serve as an additional functionality of barrier membranes that conventional barrier membranes do not provide.},

The nickel-free, high-nitrogen austenitic steel X13CrMnMoN18-14-3 (1.4452, brand name: P2000) exhibits high strength in combination with superior ductility. In order to compare suitable alloys for bone implants, we investigated titanium, 316L steel, CoCrMo and P2000 for their biocompatibility and hemocompatibility (according to DIN ISO 10993-5 and 10993-4), cell metabolism, mineralization of osteoblasts, electrochemical and mechanical properties. P2000 exhibited good biocompatibility of fibroblasts and osteoblasts without impairment in vitality or changing of cell morphology. Furthermore, investigation of the osteoblasts function by ALP activity and protein levels of the key transcription factor RUNX2 revealed 2x increased ALP activity and more than 4x increased RUNX2 protein levels for P2000 compared to titanium or 316 steel, respectively. Additionally, analyses of osteoblast biomineralization by Alizarin Red S staining exhibited more than 6x increased significant mineralization of osteoblasts grown on P2000 as compared to titanium. Further, P2000 showed no hemolytic effect and no significant influence on hemocompatibility. Nanoindentation hardness tests of Titanium and 316L specimens exposed an indentation hardness (HIT) of about 4 GPa, whereas CoCrMo and P2000 revealed HIT of 7.5 and 5.6 GPa, respectively. Moreover, an improved corrosion resistance of P2000 compared to 316L steel was observed. In summary, we could demonstrate that the nickel-free high-nitrogen steel P2000 appears to be a promising alternative candidate for applications in bone surgery. As to nearly all aspects like biocompatibility and hemocompatibility, cell metabolism, mineralization of osteoblasts and mechanical properties, P2000 was similar to or revealed advantages against titanium, 316L or CoCrMo.},

Previous developments of apps for occupational stress have not yet fully exploited the potential of multilevel diagnostics through the integration of wearable sensors for interventions. Personalizing mHealth approaches in terms of intervention time and content, which requires the use of artificial intelligence, is the next logical developmental step. The "Relax" approach developed a corresponding prototype of an app-wearable system, which will be evaluated for effectiveness in terms of stress reduction and usability. This study protocol describes an evaluation study used to test the effectiveness and usability of the Relax approach. The evaluation study was designed as a 2-arm randomized trial with 2 phases, each with a 3-week intervention period. In both phases, employees were required to use the app to record daily stress and to wear a wearable sensor to measure heart rate variability. The app offered interventions based on algorithms, which altered the probability of their selection after learning from the data, thereby personalizing the user experience. In the second phase of the study, the sample was divided into 2 groups, varying the degree of personalization of the app. To analyze effectiveness, a 2-factorial mixed within-between design will be applied to compare the outcomes between both groups as well as in a pre-post comparison. In addition, exploratory analyses of the usability of the approach are planned. The study was conducted during the spring and summer of 2024, with a total of 46 participants enrolled, and is ready for data analysis. The Relax approach, including a number of factors related to personalization that have not yet been incorporated into mHealth in current research, will provide new insights into the next steps of advanced mHealth solutions.

The recently developed pan-KRAS inhibitor daraxonrasib, also known as RMC-6236, is capable of targeting a wide array of KRAS mutations and shows promise against pancreatic and lung cancers. However, the efficacy and mechanisms of action of daraxonrasib in osteosarcoma (OS) remain unclear. We evaluated the effects of daraxonrasib on the viability, proliferation, and metastatic potential of wild-type and KRAS mutant OS cells. We assayed the effects of treatment on downstream targets using qPCR, immunoblotting, and activity assays to explore the underlying mechanism by which daraxonrasib selectively suppresses the metastatic potential of KRAS mutant osteosarcoma. Finally, we investigated how the increased prevalence of GTP-bound KRAS enhanced the sensitivity of KRAS wild-type osteosarcoma cells to daraxonrasib using siRNA targeting RASA1. Daraxonrasib selectively attenuated the proliferation and migratory ability of KRAS mutant HOS-143B cells without affecting KRAS wild-type controls. Additionally, daraxonrasib suppressed the expression of the matrix metalloproteases MMP9 and MMP1, which promote cell motility and metastasis. Daraxonrasib selectively inhibited the AKT/ETS1 pathway in HOS-143B cells, whereas no such effect was observed in HOS cells. HOS cells were sensitized to daraxonrasib by knocking down the GTPase-activating protein RASA1. In osteosarcoma, KRAS inhibition decreased MMP1, MMP9, and AKT/ETS1 signaling. Daraxonrasib is a promising agent for treating osteosarcoma with KRAS mutations.},

The same results were found when tissue distribution was measured in both groups. The histopathological analysis showed comparative tissue reactions in both BSM. Osteoconductivity index is a reliable measurement parameter for determining the healing capacities of BSM. The observed differences between both measurement methods could be assigned to the resolution capacity of μ-CT data that did not allow for a precise interface distinction between both BSM and bone tissue.

In this prospective study, HIV-1-infected patients from the Frankfurt AIDS Cohort Study (FACS) were followed for 1 year to determine the frequency of systemic hypertension and to assess the associated clinical and demographic factors. A total 214 HIV-1-infected patients, predominantly Caucasian males, participated in the study. Prevalence of systemic hypertension was 29%. The groups of hypertensive and normotensive individuals were comparable in terms of ethnic background and duration of infection. As in the general population, hypertensive subjects were older (49.1+/-11.1 vs 39.0+/-8.1 years; P<0.0001) and waist-to-hip ratio was higher than in normotensive individuals (0.99+/-0.07 vs 0.93+/-0.08; P<0.0001). Hypertension was associated with a much higher frequency of persistent proteinuria (41.1% vs 2.8%; P<0.001), coronary heart disease (16.1% vs 1.3%; P<0.0001) and myocardial infarction (8.1% vs 0.7%; P<0.005), whereas most cardiovascular risk factors were similar in both groups. Our data do not demonstrate any association between the presence of hypertension and antiretroviral therapy or immune status. However, hypertension seems to have a high impact on the existing risk for premature cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, overt proteinuria is frequent in HIV-1 infection with hypertension and might be due to hypertensive nephrosclerosis as well as yet undefined renal disease in these patients.},

The integration of these CIVMs into the drug discovery and development pipeline requires rigorous scientific validation, including cellular, morphological, and functional characterization; benchmarking of clinical biomarkers; and operationalization as robust and reproducible screening platforms. It will be critical to establish the degree of physiological complexity that is needed in each CIVM to accurately reproduce native-like homeostasis and disease phenotypes, as well as clinical pharmacological responses. Choosing which CIVM to use at each stage of the drug discovery and development pipeline will be driven by a fit-for-purpose approach, based on the specific disease pathomechanism to model and screening throughput needed. Among the different CIVMs, biofabricated tissue equivalents are emerging as robust and versatile cellular assay platforms. Biofabrication technologies, including bioprinting approaches with hydrogels and biomaterials, have enabled the production of tissues with a range of physiological complexity and controlled spatial arrangements in multiwell plate platforms, which make them amenable for medium-throughput screening. However, operationalization of such 3D biofabricated models using existing automation screening platforms comes with a unique set of challenges. These challenges will be discussed in this perspective, including examples and thoughts coming from a laboratory dedicated to designing and developing assays for automated screening.},

  abstract = {Advancement of ultrasound molecular imaging applications requires not only a reduction in size of the ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) but also a significant improvement in the in vivo stability of the shell-stabilized gas bubble. The transition from first generation to second generation UCAs was marked by an advancement in stability as air was replaced by a hydrophobic gas, such as perfluoropropane and sulfur hexafluoride. Further improvement can be realized by focusing on how well the UCAs shell can retain the encapsulated gas under extreme mechanical deformations. Here we report the next generation of UCAs for which we engineered the shell structure to impart much better stability under repeated prolonged oscillation due to ultrasound, and large changes in shear and turbulence as it circulates within the body. By adapting an architecture with two layers of contrasting elastic properties similar to bacterial cell envelopes, our ultrastable nanobubbles (NBs) withstand continuous in vitro exposure to ultrasound with minimal signal decay and have a significant delay on the onset of in vivo signal decay in kidney, liver, and tumor. Development of ultrastable NBs can potentially expand the role of ultrasound in molecular imaging, theranostics, and drug delivery.},

EETs are degraded by the enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and sEH inhibitors are considered treatment for chronic renal failure (CRF). We determined whether sEH inhibition attenuates the progression of CRF in the 5/6-nephrectomy model (5/6-Nx) in mice. 5/6-Nx mice were treated with a placebo, an ACE-inhibitor (Ramipril, 40 mg/kg), the sEH-inhibitor cAUCB or the CYP-inhibitor fenbendazole for 8 weeks. 5/6-Nx induced hypertension, albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and tubulo-interstitial damage and these effects were attenuated by Ramipril. In contrast, cAUCB failed to lower the blood pressure and albuminuria was more severe as compared to placebo. Plasma EET-levels were doubled in 5/6 Nx-mice as compared to sham mice receiving placebo. Renal sEH expression was attenuated in 5/6-Nx mice but cAUCB in these animals still further increased the EET-level. cAUCB also increased 5-HETE and 15-HETE, which derive from peroxidation or lipoxygenases. Similar to cAUCB, CYP450 inhibition increased HETEs and promoted albuminuria. Thus, sEH-inhibition failed to elicit protective effects in the 5/6-Nx model and showed a tendency to aggravate the disease. These effects might be consequence of a shift of arachidonic acid metabolism into the lipoxygenase pathway.},

Incomplete adherence is one of several possible causes of uncontrolled hypertension. Nonadherence remains largely unrecognized and is falsely interpreted as treatment resistance, as it is difficult to confirm or exclude objectively. This is the first study assessing adherence in patients with apparent resistant hypertension systematically via toxicological urine screening. All patients referred from primary care physicians because of uncontrolled hypertension between 2004 and 2011 were analysed. Adherence was assessed in all patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite the concurrent use of at least four antihypertensive agents by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis for antihypertensive drugs or their corresponding metabolites in urine. A total of 375 patients with uncontrolled hypertension were referred. After optimization of drug therapy and exclusion of white coat hypertension, 108 patients met criteria for resistant hypertension. Of those, 15 patients had secondary causes of hypertension and 17 achieved goal blood pressure with quadruple antihypertensive therapy. Of the remaining 76 patients, 40 patients (53%) were found to be nonadherent. Among nonadherent patients, 30% had complete and 70% had incomplete adherence; 85% of the latter had taken less than 50% of drugs prescribed. Lack of adherence was almost evenly distributed between different classes of antihypertensive drugs. Low adherence was the most common cause of poor blood pressure control in patients with apparent resistant hypertension, being twice as frequent as secondary causes of hypertension. Incomplete adherence was far more common than complete nonadherence; thus, assessment of adherence in patients on multiple drug regime is only reliable when all drugs are included in assessment. Assessing adherence by toxicological urine screening is a useful tool in detecting low adherence, especially in the setting of multidrug regimen as a cause of apparently resistant hypertension.},

The role of the enzyme for renal pathology in vivo, however, is unclear. To address this, three experimental animal models of renal injury (streptozotocin diabetes I, unilateral ureteral ligation (UUO), and 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx)) were studied in either Nox4-inducible (Nox4(*/*)) or constitutive knockout (Nox4(-/-)) mice. Nox4 contributed more than 80% of diphenylene iodonium-sensitive H(2)O(2) formation of freshly isolated tubules determined by Amplex Red assay. In streptozotocin diabetes, acute deletion of Nox4 by tamoxifen-activated cre-recombinase increased albuminuria, whereas matrix deposition was similar between WT and Nox4(*/*) mice. Interestingly, renal Nox4 expression, mainly localized to tubular cells, decreased in the course of diabetes and this was not associated with a compensatory upregulation of Nox1 or Nox2. In the UUO model, renal expression of ICAM1, connective tissue growth factor, and fibronectin were higher in kidneys of Nox4(*/*) than control mice. Also in this model, levels of Nox4 decreased in the course of the disease. In the 5/6Nx model, which was performed in SV129 and SV129-Nox4(-/-) mice, no difference in the development of hypertension and albuminuria was found between the strains. Collectively, the first in vivo data of the kidney do not support the view that Nox4 is a main driver of renal disease. It rather appears that under specific conditions Nox4 may even slightly limit injury and disease progression.},

During the bone drilling process, heat is generated on the drill head and within the surrounding tissue. As a result, the increased temperature can lead to thermal damage and related necrosis of the (bone) tissue. This tissue damage is dependent on different drilling parameters and can have important influence on the following tissue healing cascade and finally on implant surveillance. In this context, the present short review elucidates the current state of scientific knowledge with regard to the heat-triggering factors during the bony drilling process and how these factors can be better understood and prevented, now and in the future, through new research approaches. External and internal influencing factors during the drilling process are distinguished and methods to examine the temperature changes are compared. This mini-review further demonstrates first preliminary results of the inflammatory tissue reactions to inadequate drilling processes. Furthermore, possible solutions of new standardized ex vivo-measurement methods to better understand the factors influencing the development of heat and to reduce animal experiments are herein discussed.},

This difference was mainly driven by the 2-dose schedule for HIV patients in 2009/10. Vitamin D levels were lower in HIV patients but did not correlate with immune response. HIV-infected patients who had received 1 or 2 doses of an adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine in the previous year (2009/10) had a significant higher seroconversion rate following TIV as compared to healthy controls, indicating a stronger memory cell response due to the 2-dose schedule.},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis and therapy of Shigatoxin 2 (Stx2)-mediated kidney failure remain controversial. Our aim was to test whether, during an infection with Stx2-producing E. coli (STEC), Stx2 exerts direct effects on renal tubular epithelium and thereby possibly contributes to acute renal failure. Mice represent a suitable model because they, like humans, express the Stx2-receptor Gb3 in the tubular epithelium but, in contrast to humans, not in glomerular endothelia, and are thus free of glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). In wild-type mice, Stx2 caused acute tubular dysfunction with consequent electrolyte disturbance, which was most likely the cause of death. Tubule-specific depletion of Gb3 protected the mice from acute renal failure. In vitro, Stx2 induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis in human tubular epithelial cells, thus implicating a direct effect of Stx2 on the tubular epithelium. To correlate these results to human disease, kidney biopsies and outcome were analysed in patients with Stx2-associated kidney failure (n = 11, aged 22-44 years). The majority of kidney biopsies showed different stages of an ongoing TMA; however, no glomerular complement activation could be demonstrated. All biopsies, including those without TMA, showed severe acute tubular damage. Due to these findings, patients were treated with supportive therapy without complement-inhibiting antibodies (eculizumab) or immunoadsorption. Despite the severity of the initial disease [creatinine 6.34 (1.31-17.60) mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 1944 (753-2792) U/l, platelets 33 (19-124)/nl and haemoglobin 6.2 (5.2-7.8) g/dl; median (range)], all patients were discharged after 33 (range 19-43) days with no neurological symptoms and no dialysis requirement [creatinine 1.39 (range 0.84-2.86) mg/dl]. The creatinine decreased further to 0.90 (range 0.66-1.27) mg/dl after 24 months. Based on these data, one may surmise that acute tubular damage represents a separate pathophysiological mechanism, importantly contributing to Stx2-mediated acute kidney failure. Specifically in young adults, an excellent outcome can be achieved by supportive therapy only.},

Twenty four patients with IVDU underwent renal biopsy because of progressive chronic kidney disease or proteinuria. Renal AA-amyloidosis was the predominant cause of renal failure in 50% of patients. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (GN) was the second most common cause found in 21%. Patients with AA-amyloidosis were more likely to be HIV infected (67 vs.17%; p=0.036) and tended to have a higher rate of repeated systemic infections (92 vs. 50%; p=0.069). Patients with AA-amyloidosis presented with progressive renal disease and nephrotic-range proteinuria but most patients had no peripheral edema or systemic hypertension. Development of proteinuria preceded the decline of GFR for approximately 1-2 years. AA-amyloidosis was the predominant cause of progressive renal disease in the last 10 years in patients with IVDU. The highest rate of AA-amyloidosis observed was seen in HIV infected patients with IVDU. We speculate that chronic HIV-infection as well as the associated immunosuppression might promote development of AA-amyloidosis by increasing frequency and duration of infections acquired by IVDU.},

We now report that VEGFR2 causes PKA-mediated phosphorylation of VLA-4 on S988, an event known to stimulate tumor metastasis while suppressing cytotoxic immune cells. A key partner in this mechanism is the chemokine receptor CXCR4, a well-known mediator of cell motility in response to gradients of the chemokine SDF-1 (also known as CXCL12). The entire machinery necessary to phosphorylate VLA-4, consisting of CXCR4, AC7 (also known as ADCY7) and PKA, is constitutively associated with VEGFR2 and is localized to the integrin by Sdc1. VEGFR2 carries out the novel phosphorylation of Y135 within the DRY microswitch of CXCR4, sequentially activating Gα},

In cholesterol-fed rabbits, the infarct size was significantly increased when compared with normal diet animals (63+/-3% versus 41+/-3%). Acute cariporide treatment reduced the infarct size in normal diet rabbits to 14%+/-3% (66% decrease, P<0.05) as well as in atherogenic diet rabbits to 22+/-3% (65% decrease, P<0.05). Chronic treatment with cariporide also reduced the infarct size significantly: normal diet 19+/-2% (53% decrease, P<0.05), atherogenic diet 32+/-3% (49% decrease, P<0.05). Total cholesterol serum levels in rabbits with atherogenic diet were significantly higher (15.3+/-2.7 mmol/l) than those on a standard diet (0.65+/-0.08 mmol/l). Chronic cariporide treatment significantly attenuated the increase of serum cholesterol (7.9+/-1.9 mmol/l) and improved the lipoprotein pattern. Although the aortas and heart vessels of hypercholesterolaemic animals were without any histological evidence of atherosclerosis they developed endothelial dysfunction (reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation by ACh), which was prevented by chronic cariporide treatment.

The contribution of different forms of renovascular hypertension and the mechanisms contributing to autonomic dysfunction in hypertension are incompletely understood. Here, murine models of renovascular hypertension with preserved (2-kidneys-1 clip, 2K1C) and reduced (1-kidney-1 clip, 1K1C) kidney mass were studied with regard to autonomic nervous system regulation (sympathetic tone: power-spectral analysis of systolic blood pressure; parasympathetic tone: power-spectral analysis of heart rate) and baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate by spontaneous, concomitant changes of systolic blood pressure and pulse interval. Involvement of the renin-angiotensin system and the rho-kinase pathway were determined by application of inhibitors. C57BL6N mice (6 to 11) with reduced kidney mass (1K1C) or with preserved kidney mass (2K1C) developed a similar degree of hypertension. In comparison to control mice, both models presented with a significantly increased sympathetic tone and lower baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate. However, only 2K1C animals had a lower parasympathetic tone, whereas urinary norepinephrine excretion was reduced in the 1K1C model. Rho kinase inhibition given to a subset of 1K1C and 2K1C animals improved baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate selectively in the 1K1C model. Rho kinase inhibition had no additional effects on autonomic nervous system in either model of renovascular hypertension and did not change the blood pressure. Blockade of AT1 receptors (in 2K1C animals) normalized the sympathetic tone, decreased resting heart rate, improved baroreflex sensitivity of heart rate and parasympathetic tone. Regardless of residual renal mass, blood pressure and sympathetic tone are increased, whereas baroreflex sensitivity is depressed in murine models of renovascular hypertension. Reduced norepinephrine excretion and/or degradation might contribute to sympathoactivation in renovascular hypertension with reduced renal mass (1K1C). Overall, the study helps to direct research to optimize medical therapy of hypertension.},

  abstract = {Biphasic bone substitutes (BBS) are currently well-established biomaterials. Through their constant development, even natural components like hyaluronic acid (HY) have been added to improve both their handling and also their regenerative properties. However, little knowledge exists regarding the consequences of the addition of HY to their biocompatibility and the inflammatory tissue reactions. Thus, the present study was conducted, aiming to analyze the influence of two different amounts of high molecular weight HY (HMWHY), combined with a BBS, on in vitro biocompatibility and in vivo tissue reaction. Established in vitro procedures, using L929 cells, were used for cytocompatibility analyses under the test conditions of DIN EN:ISO 10993-5. For the in vivo part of the study, calvarial defects were created in 20 Wistar rats and subsequently filled with BBS, and BBS combined with two different HMWHY amounts, i.e., BBS + HY(L) and BBS + HY(H). As controls, empty defects were used. Established histological, immunohistochemical, and histomorphometrical methods were applied to analyze the tissue reactions to the three different materials, including the induction of pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages and multinucleated giant cells (BMGCs). The in vitro results showed that none of the materials or compositions caused biological damage to the L929 cells and can be considered to be non-toxic. The in vivo results showed that only the addition of high doses of HY to a biphasic bone substitute significantly decreases the occurrence of pro-inflammatory macrophages (* },

All deceased persons (n 5 129) who underwent forensic autopsy because of suspected connection with illicit drug abuse between January 1, 2009, and April 30, 2011, in Frankfurt/Main, Germany. Clinical characteristics and patterns of drug abuse. Histopathologic alterations of the kidney. Hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, Sirius, and Congo Red stainings and immunoglobulin A immunohistochemistry of all cases; additional histochemical stainings or immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy in selected cases. Individuals were mostly white (99.2%), were male (82.2%), and had intravenous drug use (IVDU) (81.4%). Median age at death was 39 years and duration of drug abuse was 17 years. The majority (79.1%) took various drugs in parallel as assessed by toxicologic analysis. Despite a young age, the deceased had a high burden of comorbid conditions, especially cardiovascular disease, liver cirrhosis, and infections. Evaluation of the kidneys demonstrated a broad spectrum of pathologic alterations predominated by arteriosclerotic and ischemic damage, mild interstitial inflammation, calcification of renal parenchyma, and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, with hypertensive-ischemic nephropathy as the most common cause of nephropathy. Interstitial inflammation (OR, 16.59; 95% CI, 3.91-70.39) and renal calcification (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.03- 5.75) were associated with severe IVDU, whereas hypertensive and ischemic damage were associated with cocaine abuse (OR, 6.00; 95% CI, 1.27-28.44). Neither specific glomerular damage indicative for heroin and hepatitis C virus-related disease nor signs of analgesic nephropathy were found. White population, lack of a comparable control group, incomplete clinical data, and absence of routine immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. Illicit drug abuse is associated with a broad but unspecific spectrum of pathologic alterations of the kidneys. Cocaine abuse has a deleterious role in this setting by promoting hypertensive and ischemic damage.},

  abstract = {Rho-family GTPases like RhoA and Rac-1 are potent regulators of cellular signaling that control gene expression, migration and inflammation. Activation of Rho-GTPases has been linked to podocyte dysfunction, a feature of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). We investigated the effect of Rac-1 and Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibition on progressive renal failure in mice and studied the underlying mechanisms in podocytes. SV129 mice were subjected to 5/6-nephrectomy which resulted in arterial hypertension and albuminuria. Subgroups of animals were treated with the Rac-1 inhibitor EHT1846, the ROCK inhibitor SAR407899 and the ACE inhibitor Ramipril. Only Ramipril reduced hypertension. In contrast, all inhibitors markedly attenuated albumin excretion as well as glomerular and tubulo-interstitial damage. The combination of SAR407899 and Ramipril was more effective in preventing albuminuria than Ramipril alone. To study the involved mechanisms, podocytes were cultured from SV129 mice and exposed to static stretch in the Flexcell device. This activated RhoA and Rac-1 and led via TGFβ to apoptosis and a switch of the cells into a more mesenchymal phenotype, as evident from loss of WT-1 and nephrin and induction of α-SMA and fibronectin expression. Rac-1 and ROCK inhibition as well as blockade of TGFβ dramatically attenuated all these responses. This suggests that Rac-1 and RhoA are mediators of podocyte dysfunction in CKD. Inhibition of Rho-GTPases may be a novel approach for the treatment of CKD.},

  abstract = {Maclurin is a phenolic compound extracted from purple mangosteen and mulberry twigs. Earlier reports indicated that it exerts antioxidant activity. We hypothesized that maclurin exerts antioxidant activity and anti-cancer effects in small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (SCNCs), a very aggressive type of human prostate cancer. To verify our hypothesis, we selected PC3 cells as a model system and investigated the antioxidant activity and anti-cancer effects of maclurin. In the reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection assay for the verification of antioxidant activity, we observed the unexpected prooxidant activity of maclurin in PC3 cells. For the anti-cancer activities, we investigated the effects of maclurin on induction of apoptosis and inhibition of metastatic characteristics of PC3 cells. In the apoptosis assay, maclurin significantly induced apoptosis of PC3 cells. Maclurin also showed significant anti-metastatic effects. Maclurin inhibited cell migration in a dosage-dependent manner. In addition, the gelatin zymography assay indicated that maclurin inhibited activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) that affect cell migration and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. Then, we investigated the effects of maclurin on the cancer-related signaling molecules. Maclurin activated p38 signaling and inhibited c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), focal-adhesion kinase (FAK), AKT, and c-Myc signalings in PC3 cells. Finally, we observed prooxidant activity and anti-SCNC effects of maclurin in DU145 cells. This suggests that the effects of maclurin may not be specifically limited to PC3 cells. Our findings suggest that maclurin exerts anti-cancer effects on SCNC cells via activation of p38 and inhibitions of JNK, FAK, AKT and c-Myc signalings.},

Thirty-six rabbits received two different cylindrical implants press-fit inserted into the distal femoral metaphysis. At day 0, 28, and 56, implant ingrowth was monitored by radiography; implant stability was assessed by pull-out torque measurements while bone-to-implant contact (BIC) was determined histomorphometrically. Radiography revealed comparable implant ingrowth after 1 and 2 months for both implant materials. The pull-out force of P2000 tended to be higher than that for titanium at day 28 (p = .076) but the values were comparable at day 56 (p = .905). At day 56, implant fixation was significantly increased compared to the day of surgery for both, P2000 (p = .030) and for titanium alloy (p = .026). Microscopic examination revealed that both implant types appeared to be well integrated and firmly anchored in the bone. BIC ratio of titanium alloy tended to be higher at day 28 (p = .079) but they did not differ significantly at day 56 (p = .711).

Wounds, especially chronic wounds, affect 2% to 3% of the elderly population and comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases. The prevailing reasons to develop skin wounds include venous and/or arterial circulatory disorders, diabetes, or constant pressure to the skin (decubitus). The hallmarks of modern wound treatment include debridement of dead tissue, disinfection, wound dressings that keep the wound moist but still allow air exchange, and compression bandages. Despite all these efforts there is still a huge treatment resistance and wounds will not heal. This calls for new and more efficient treatment options in combination with novel biocompatible skin scaffolds. Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) is such an innovative addition to the treatment armamentarium. In one CAP application, antimicrobial effects, wound acidification, enhanced microcirculations and cell stimulation can be achieved. It is evident that CAP treatment, in combination with novel bioengineered, biocompatible and biodegradable electrospun scaffolds, has the potential of fostering wound healing by promoting remodeling and epithelialization along such temporarily applied skin replacement scaffolds.},

Since ROS are thought to promote atherosclerosis, we hypothesized that XO is involved in the development of atherosclerosis. ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a Western-type (WD) or control diet. In subgroups, tungsten (700 mg/L) was administered to inhibit XO. XO is a secreted enzyme which is formed in the liver as xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) and binds to the vascular endothelium. High expression of XDH was found in the liver and WD increased liver XDH mRNA and XDH protein expression. WD induced the conversion of XDH to the radical-forming XO. Moreover, WD increased the hepatic expression of CD40, demonstrating activation of hepatic cells. Aortic tissue of ApoE(-/-) mice fed a WD for 6 months exhibited marked atherosclerosis, attenuated endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, increased vascular oxidative stress, and mRNA expression of the chemokine KC. Tungsten treatment had no effect on plasma lipids but lowered the plasma XO activity. In animals fed a control diet, tungsten had no effect on radical formation, endothelial function, or atherosclerosis development. In mice fed a WD, however tungsten attenuated the vascular superoxide anion formation, prevented endothelial dysfunction, and attenuated KC mRNA expression. Most importantly, tungsten treatment largely prevented the development of atherosclerosis in the aorta of ApoE(-/-) mice on WD. Therefore, tungsten, potentially via the inhibition of XO, prevents the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in ApoE(-/-) mice on WD.},

The results showed that: (1) during phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC) the frequency and duration of contractions showed a significant decrease in the duodenum for WS(R) 1340; (2) WS(R) 1520 significantly reduced the contraction amplitudes in the duodenum during phase I and II of the MMC; (3) trends for decreased values were seen for WS(R) 1340 in the gastric corpus and duodenum and for WS(R) 1520 in the gastric antrum; (4) in the gastric corpus the duration of contractions was significantly reduced after application of WS(R) 1340 during phases I and II of the MMC; (5) WS(R) 1520 significantly reduced the contraction amplitudes and the duration of contractions in the gastric corpus during phase III of the MMC; (6) for the hydrophobic phase a moderate but significant decrease of duration of contractions in the duodenum and of frequency of contractions in the gastric corpus was seen. No adverse events were observed during the study. In conclusion, it could be shown that both WS(R) 1340 and WS(R) 1520 contribute to the efficacy of Enteroplant(R). They act locally in the stomach and duodenum to produce smooth-muscle relaxation.

The results of the present study demonstrate that the tissue response to the dPTFE membrane involves inflammatory macrophages, but comparable cell numbers were also detected in the implant beds of the control collagen membrane, which is known to be biocompatible. Although these data indicate that the analyzed dPTFE membrane is not fully bioinert, but its biocompatibility is comparable to collagen-based membranes. Based on its optimal biocompatibility, the novel dPTFE barrier membrane may optimally support bone healing within the context of guided bone regeneration (GBR).},

Trisodium citrate was infused at a rate of 0.43 mmol/min to achieve post-filter ionized calcium levels of <0.4 mmol/l. Calcium substitution rate was 0.19 mmol/min to maintain physiologic iCa levels. RCA was well tolerated with no significant differences in pH, iCa, bicarbonate or potassium after repeated sessions. Clotting events complicated 7.3% of the procedures. Adverse events occurred in 3.4% of TPE procedures; none was severe or fatal. No significant differences were observed comparing the rate of adverse events to those observed in TPE using standard anticoagulation at our center (4.8%). We describe for the first time a modified protocol for RCA in TPE using an integrated citrate module.

Blood pressure was identical in sham-operated ecSOD+/+ and ecSOD-/- mice. After 6 days of angiotensin II-treatment and 2 and 4 weeks after renal artery clipping, blood pressure was significantly higher in ecSOD-/- than ecSOD+/+ mice. Recombinant ecSOD selectively decreased blood pressure in hypertensive ecSOD-/- mice, whereas ecSOD had no effect in normotensive and hypertensive ecSOD+/+ mice. Compared with sham-operated ecSOD+/+ mice, sham-operated ecSOD-/- mice exhibited attenuated acetylcholine-induced relaxations. These responses were further depressed in vessels from clipped animals. Vascular O2.-, as measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence, was higher in ecSOD-/- compared with ecSOD+/+ mice and was increased by clipping. The antioxidant tiron normalized relaxations in vessels from sham-operated and clipped ecSOD-/-, as well as from clipped ecSOD+/+ mice. In contrast, in vivo application of ecSOD selectively enhanced endothelium-dependent relaxation in vessels from ecSOD-/- mice. These data reveal that endogenous ecSOD is a major antagonistic principle to vascular O2.-, controlling blood pressure and vascular function in angiotensin II-dependent models of hypertension. ecSOD is expressed in such an abundance that even in situations of high oxidative stress no relative lack of enzyme activity occurs.},

One of the most important characteristics of a resorbable barrier membrane is its mechanical integrity that is required for space maintenance and its tissue integration that plays a crucial role in wound healing and bone augmentation. This study compares a commercially available porcine-derived sugar-crosslinked collagen membrane with two non-crosslinked collagen barrier membranes. The material analysis provides an insight into the influence of manufacturing on the microstructure. In vivo subcutaneous implantation model provides further information on the host tissue reaction of the barrier membranes, as well as their tissue integration patterns that involve cellular infiltration, vascularization, and degradation. The obtained histochemical and immunohistochemical results over three time points (10, 30, and 60 days) showed that the tissue response to the sugar crosslinked collagen membrane involves inflammatory macrophages in a comparable manner to the macrophages observed in the surrounding tissue of the control collagen-based membranes, which were proven as biocompatible. The tissue reactions to the barrier membranes were additionally compared to wounds from a sham operation. Results suggest wound healing properties of all the investigated barrier membranes. However, the sugar-crosslinked membrane lacked in cellular infiltration and transmembraneous vascularization, providing an exclusive barrier function in GBR. Moreover, this membrane maintained a similar swelling ratio over examined timepoints, which suggests a very slow degradation pattern and supports its barrier function. Based on the study results, which showed biocompatibility of the sugar crosslinked membrane and its stability up to 60 days post-implantation, it can be concluded that this membrane may be suitable for application in GBR as a biomaterial with exclusive barrier functionality, similar to non-resorbable options.},

However, it has been described that it is necessary to prevent premature degradation to ensure both the functionality and the biocompatibility of such Mg implants. Different coating strategies have already been developed, but most of them did not provide the desired functionality. The present study analyses a new approach based on ion implantation (II) with PVD coating for the passivation of a newly developed Mg membrane for GBR/GTR procedures. To demonstrate comprehensive biocompatibility and successful passivation of the Mg membranes, untreated Mg (MG) and coated Mg (MG-Co) were investigated in vitro and in vivo. Thereby a collagen membrane with an already shown biocompatibility was used as control material. All investigations were performed according to EN ISO 10993 regulations. The in vitro results showed that both the untreated and PVD-coated membranes were not cytocompatible. However, both membrane types fulfilled the requirements for in vivo biocompatibility. Interestingly, the PVD coating did not have an influence on the gas cavity formation compared to the uncoated membrane, but it induced lower numbers of anti-inflammatory macrophages in comparison to the pure Mg membrane and the collagen membrane. In contrast, the pure Mg membrane provoked an immune response that was fully comparable to the collagen membrane. Altogether, this study shows that pure magnesium membranes represent a promising alternative compared to the nonresorbable volume-stable materials for GBR/GTR therapy.},

However, no in vivo studies regarding the induction of M1- and M2-macrophages and their time-dependent ration as well as the analysis of the bone regeneration capacity of jellyfish collagen scaffolds have been conducted until now. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine the nature of the immune response to jellyfish collagen scaffolds and their bone healing capacities. Two in vivo studies using established implantation models, i.e., the subcutaneous and the calvarian implantation model in Wistar rats, were conducted. Furthermore, specialized histological, histopathological, and histomorphometrical methods have been used. As a control biomaterial, a collagen scaffold, originating from porcine pericardium, which has already been stated as biocompatible, was used for the subcutaneous study. The results of the present study show that jellyfish collagen scaffolds are nearly completely resorbed until day 60 post implantation by stepwise integration within the subcutaneous connective tissue mediated mainly by macrophages and single multinucleated giant cells. Interestingly, the degradation process ended in a vessel rich connective tissue that is understood to be an optimal basis for tissue regeneration. The study results showed an overall weaker immune response to jellyfish collagen than to porcine pericardium matrices by the induction of significantly lower numbers of macrophages together with a more balanced occurrence of M1- and M2-macrophages. However, both collagen-based biomaterials induced balanced numbers of both macrophage subtypes, which supports their good biocompatibility. Moreover, the histomorphometrical results for the calvarial implantation of the jellyfish scaffolds revealed an average of 46.20% de novo bone formation at day 60, which was significantly higher compared to the control group. Thereby, the jellyfish collagen scaffolds induced also significantly higher numbers of anti-inflammatory macrophages within the bony implantation beds. Altogether, the results show that the jellyfish collagen scaffolds allowed for a directed integration behavior, which is assumed to be in accordance with the concept of Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR). Furthermore, the jellyfish collagen scaffolds induced a long-term anti-inflammatory macrophage response and an optimal vascularization pattern within their implant beds, thus showing excellent biocompatibility and (bone) tissue healing properties.},

The aim of this study was to coat nickel-titanium (NiTi) and beta-titanium (β-Ti), also known as titanium molybdenum (TMA), archwires by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) and to analyze the characteristics of the PEO-surfaces. PEO-coatings were generated on 0.014-inch NiTi and 0.19 × 0.25-inch β-Ti archwires. The surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and stereomicroscopy. Cytocompatibility testing was performed with ceramized and untreated samples according to EN ISO 10993-5 in XTT-, BrdU- and LDH-assays. The direct cell impact was analyzed using LIVE-/DEAD-staining. In addition, the archwires were inserted in an orthodontic model and photographs were taken before and after insertion. The PEO coatings were 15 to 20 µm thick with a whitish appearance. The cytocompatibility analysis revealed good cytocompatibility results for both ceramized NiTi and β-Ti archwires. In the direct cell tests, the ceramized samples showed improved compatibility as compared to those of uncoated samples. However, bending of the archwires resulted in loss of the PEO-surfaces. Nevertheless, it was possible to insert the β-Ti PEO-coated archwire in an orthodontic model without loss of the PEO-ceramic. PEO is a promising technique for the generation of esthetic orthodontic archwires. Since the PEO-coating does not resist bending, its clinical use seems to be limited so far to orthodontic techniques using straight or pre-bent archwires.},

  abstract = {The soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) metabolizes vasodilatory epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) to their di-hydroxy derivatives. We hypothesized that the metabolism of EETs by the sEH contributes to angiotensin II-induced hypertension and tested the effects of a water-soluble sEH inhibitor, 12-(3-adamantan-1-yl-ureido) dodecanoic acid (AUDA) on blood pressure. AUDA (130 microg/mL in drinking water) did not affect blood pressure in normotensive animals but markedly lowered it in mice with angiotensin II-induced hypertension (1 mg/kg per day). The effect of AUDA was accompanied by an increase in urinary salt and water excretion. Intravenous application of AUDA (8 mg/kg) acutely lowered blood pressure and heart rate in animals with angiotensin II-induced hypertension but failed to affect blood pressure in animals with phenylephrine-induced hypertension (29 mg/kg per day). AUDA (0.1 micromol/L) selectively lowered vascular resistance in an isolated perfused kidney preparation from angiotensin II-pretreated mice but not from control mice. In the perfused hind limb and in isolated carotid arteries from angiotensin II-treated mice, AUDA was without effect. The omega-hydroxylase inhibitor N-methylsulfonyl-12,12-dibromododec-11-enamide, which attenuates formation of the potent vasoconstrictor 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, decreased tone in carotid arteries from angiotensin II-treated but not from control mice. These data demonstrate that the decrease in blood pressure observed after sEH inhibition in angiotensin II-induced hypertension can be attributed to an initial reduction in heart rate followed by pressure diuresis resulting from increased perfusion of the kidney. Direct vasodilatation of resistance arteries in skeletal muscles does not appear to contribute to the antihypertensive effects of sEH inhibition in mice.},

These include leg ulcers with venous disease greatly prevailing arterial disease, diabetic foot syndrome, and pressure ulcers. Due to a considerable treatment resistance against such therapies, new and effective, additive treatment options especially for chronic wounds are needed. Wound treatment with cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) constitutes such an innovative option. Current research regarding the efficacy of cold plasma for healing of acute and chronic wounds is summarized. The literature on CAP applications in wound healing has been screened and reviewed. With CAP, several effects that promote wound healing can be simultaneously applied in one application. On the one hand, CAP exerts a strong and broad antimicrobial activity against biofilm. On the other hand, the plasma cocktail, which consists of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, UV, and charged particles (electrical current), mediates tissue-stimulating, blood flow-promoting, and anti-inflammatory effects. Marked germ reduction on wounds and accelerated wound healing have already been convincingly demonstrated in controlled clinical studies. The comprehensive CAP study landscape with structured case report summaries and randomized case-control studies allows the conclusion that CAP is safe, effective, and easy to handle for wound treatment. The utilization of CAP in addition to standard wound treatments is starting to enter routine clinical practice.},

Subcutaneous implantation model analyzed the biocompatibility of PCL + BCP and PCL scaffolds. Calvaria implantation model analyzed the osteoconductive properties of PCL and PCL + BCP scaffolds compared to BCP as control group. Established histological, histopathological and histomorphometrical methods were performed to evaluate new bone formation.; (3) Results Mechanical testing demonstrated no significant differences between PCL and PCL + BCP for both designs. Similar biocompatibility was observed subcutaneously for PCL and PCL + BCP scaffolds. In the calvaria model, new bone formation was observed for all groups with largest new bone formation in the BCP group, followed by the PCL + BCP group, and the PCL group. This finding was influenced by the initial volume of biomaterial implanted and remaining volume after 90 days. All materials showed osteoconductive properties and PCL + BCP tailored the tissue responses towards higher cellular biodegradability. Moreover, this material combination led to a reduced swelling in PCL + BCP; (4) Conclusions: Altogether, the results show that the newly developed composite is biocompatible and leads to successful osteoconductive bone regeneration. The new biomaterial combines the structural stability provided by PCL with bioactive characteristics of BCP-based BSM. 3D-printed BSM provides an integration behavior in accordance with the concept of guided bone regeneration (GBR) by directing new bone growth for proper function and restoration.},

However, in most in vitro settings that study neural physiology, cells are grown as monolayers on stiff surfaces that maximize adhesion and proliferation, and, therefore, they lack the physiological cues that ECM in native neuronal tissues provides. Macromolecular crowding (MMC) is a biophysical phenomenon based on the principle of excluded volume that can be harnessed to induce native ECM deposition by cells in culture. Here, we show that MMC using two species of Ficoll with vitamin C supplementation significantly boosts deposition of relevant brain ECM by cultured human astrocytes. Dopaminergic neurons cocultured on this astrocyte-ECM bed prepared under MMC treatment showed longer and denser neuronal extensions, a higher number of pre ad post synaptic contacts, and increased physiological activity, as evidenced by higher frequency calcium oscillation, compared to standard coculture conditions. When the pharmacological activity of various compounds was tested on MMC-treated cocultures, their responses were enhanced, and for apomorphine, a D2-receptor agonist, it was inverted in comparison to control cell culture conditions, thus emulating responses observed in in vivo settings. These results indicate that macromolecular crowding can harness the ECM-building potential of human astrocytes in vitro forming an ultra-flat 3D microenvironment that makes neural cultures more physiological and pharmacological relevant.},

Cerebral oxygen saturation was derived by near-infrared spectroscopy. S100B reference values based on preoperative samples; concentrations above the 75th percentile were defined as elevated. Patients with elevated S100B at 24 or 48 hours were compared to cases with S100B in the normal range. Neonates (≤28 days) and infants (>28 and ≤365 days) were analyzed separately due to age-dependent release of S100B. Seventy-four patients underwent 94 surgical procedures (neonates, n = 38; infants, n = 56). S100B concentrations were higher in neonates before and after surgery at all time points (P ≤ .015). Highest values were noticed immediately after surgery. Postoperative S100B was elevated after 15 (40.5%) surgeries in neonates. There was no difference in pre-, intra-, or postoperative cerebral oxygenation. In infants, postoperative S100B was elevated after 23 (41.8%) procedures.

By contrast, impaired social relationships, social isolation, or the loss of a bonded partner lead to aggravated physical and mental health. For example, in humans partner loss is detrimental for the functioning of the immune system and heightens the susceptibility for the development of post-traumatic stress disorders, anxiety disorders, and major depressive disorders. To understand potential underlying mechanisms, the monogamous prairie vole can provide important insights. In the present study, we separated pair bonded male and female prairie voles after five days of co-housing, subjected them to the forced swim test on the fourth day following separation, and studied their microglia morphology and activation in specific brain regions. Partner loss increased passive stress-coping in male, but not female, prairie voles. Moreover, partner loss was associated with microglial priming within the parvocellular region of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in male prairie voles, whereas in female prairie voles the morphological activation within the whole PVN and the prelimbic cortex (PrL) was decreased, marked by a shift towards ramified microglial morphology. Expression of the immediate early protein c-Fos following partner loss was changed within the PrL of male, but not female, prairie voles. However, the loss of a partner did not affect the investigated aspects of the peripheral immune response. These data suggest a potential sex-dependent mechanism for the regulation of microglial activity following the loss of a partner, which might contribute to the observed differences in passive stress-coping. This study furthers our understanding of the effects of partner loss and its short-term impact on the CNS as well as the CNS immune system and the peripheral innate immune system in both male and female prairie voles.},

The 1-kidney-1-clip model resulted in impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and hypertension and vascular oxidative stress in wild-type and ecSOD-/- mice. Recombinant ecSOD lowered the blood pressure and improved aortic nitric oxide bioavailability in wild-type and ecSOD-/- but not eNOS-/- mice. ecSOD had no effect on blood pressure in eNOS-/- or wild-type mice treated with a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The 1-kidney-1-clip model markedly induced ecSOD protein expression, whereas activity was increased by only 25%, suggesting a partial inactivation of ecSOD in high-volume hypertension. Incubation of aortic segments with peroxynitrite or hydrogen peroxide attenuated ecSOD activity, but peroxynitrite did not induce tyrosine nitration of ecSOD, suggesting oxidative inactivation of the enzyme. Administration of polyethyleneglycol-catalase for 3 days selectively lowered the blood pressure in ecSOD+/+ but not ecSOD-/- mice and improved nitric oxide bioavailability. In contrast, acute application of catalase had no effect. Nitric oxide mediates the vascular effects of ecSOD. Vascular dysfunction in 1-kidney-1-clip model hypertension is partially a consequence of inactivation of ecSOD by reactive oxygen species.},

Nevertheless, there is still a need for improved surface modifications of Titanium, in order to change surface properties such as wettability, antibacterial properties or tissue attachment. In this study, different novel plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) modifications have been investigated for tendon adhesion to implants commonly used in hand surgery. Titanium samples with four different PEO modifications were prepared by varying the electrolyte composition and analyzed with regards to their surface properties. Unmodified titanium blanks and Dotize® coating served as controls. Samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), contact angle measuring system and analyzed for their biocompatibility and hemocompatibility (according to DIN ISO 10993-5 and 10,993-4). Finally, tendon adhesion of these specific surfaces were investigated by pull-off tests. Our findings show that surface thickness of PEO modifications was about 12-20 μm and had porous morphology. One modification demonstrated hydrophilic behavior accompanied by good biocompatibility without showing cytotoxic properties. Furthermore, no hemolytic effect and no significant influence on hemocompatibility were observed. Pull-off tests revealed a significant reduction of tendon adhesion by 64.3% (35.7% residual adhesion), compared to unmodified titanium (100%). In summary, the novel PEO-based ceramic-like porous modification for titanium surfaces might be considered a good candidate for orthopedic applications supporting a more efficient recovery.},

The adhesion of the orbital soft tissue to the mesh causes diplopia, lid rigidity and extraocular movements restriction. This study was performed to determine if the placement of a collagen membrane over a titanium mesh can prevent the adhesion of orbital soft tissue for an improved clinical outcome. Clinical considerations: A case study was performed investigating 106 patients undergoing a periorbital restoration. Seventy-two patients received a titanium mesh without a barrier membrane, 12 patients received a barrier membrane composed of autologous auricular cartilage to provide a barrier function and 22 patients received a pericardium collagen membrane and titanium mesh. Titanium has been shown to generate an intense inflammatory reaction in host tissues, which can cause fibrosis to adjacent structures. Fibrosis is an essential factor in the repair of fracture sites, however this can lead to adverse effects in the orbital socket. Fibrosis can cause cicatrization and lower eyelid retraction when induced along the lower orbital rim. An improved outcome can be achieved by using a barrier between the titanium mesh and the soft tissue, such as autogenous auricular cartilage, however, only patients treated with a resorbable collagen membrane to act as a soft tissue barricade during site regeneration, prevented the fibrosis reaction and related problems from occurring.},
