  abstract = {Intranasal midazolam can produce procedural sedation in frail older patients with dementia who are unable to tolerate necessary medical or dental procedures during domiciliary medical care. Little is known about the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intranasal midazolam in older (>65 yr old) people. The aim of this study was to understand the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of intranasal midazolam in older people with the primary goal of developing a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model to facilitate safer domiciliary sedation care. We recruited 12 volunteers: ASA physical status 1-2, aged 65-80 yr, and received midazolam 5 mg intravenously and 5 mg intranasally on two study days separated by a 6 day washout period. Concentrations of venous midazolam and 1'-OH-midazolam, Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) score, bispectral index (BIS), arterial pressure, ECG, and respiratory parameters were measured for 10 h. Time to peak effect of intranasal midazolam for BIS, MAP, and SpO Intranasal bioavailability was high and sedation onset was rapid, with maximum sedative effects after 32 min. We developed a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for intranasal midazolam for older persons and an online tool to simulate changes in MOAA/S, BIS, MAP, and SpO EudraCT (2019-004806-90).},

While widely used in the operating room, their application in the intensive care unit (ICU) remains limited despite the complexity of drug dosing in critically ill patients. This scoping review evaluates existing evidence on the use of TCI systems in ICU settings, focusing on sedation, analgesia, and antibiotic administration. A systematic literature search was conducted in Medline and the Cochrane Library up to August 2024. Studies involving adult ICU patients receiving TCI for any drug were included. Data were extracted on study design, PKPD models, performance metrics, and clinical endpoints. A total of 281 studies were identified; 14 focused on sedatives, particularly propofol and remifentanil, using the Marsh and Minto models. TCI was associated with more stable sedation, improved titration, and fewer adverse events. Evidence on dexmedetomidine and midazolam was limited. Only three studies explored antibiotic TCI, mainly for vancomycin and cefepime, showing potential but lacking robust clinical validation. In conclusion, while current findings are promising, the evidence base supporting TCI-especially in the context of newer, generalized pharmacokinetic models and antibiotics-remains insufficient, and its broader application requires further clinical research and model validation.},

  abstract = {Etomidate is a hypnotic agent that is used for the induction of anesthesia. It produces its effect by acting as a positive allosteric modulator on the γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor and thus enhancing the effect of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid. Etomidate stands out among other anesthetic agents by having a remarkably stable cardiorespiratory profile, producing no cardiovascular or respiratory depression. However, etomidate suppresses the adrenocortical axis by the inhibition of the enzyme 11β-hydroxylase. This makes the drug unsuitable for administration by a prolonged infusion. It also makes the drug unsuitable for administration to critically ill patients. Etomidate has relatively large volumes of distributions and is rapidly metabolized by hepatic esterases into an inactive carboxylic acid through hydrolyzation. Because of the decrease in popularity of etomidate, few modern extensive pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies exist. Over the last decade, several analogs of etomidate have been developed, with the aim of retaining its stable cardiorespiratory profile, whilst eliminating its suppressive effect on the adrenocortical axis. One of these molecules, ABP-700, was studied in extensive phase I clinical trials. These found that ABP-700 is characterized by small volumes of distribution and rapid clearance. ABP-700 is metabolized similarly to etomidate, by hydrolyzation into an inactive carboxylic acid. Furthermore, ABP-700 showed a rapid onset and offset of clinical effect. One side effect observed with both etomidate and ABP-700 is the occurrence of involuntary muscle movements. The origin of these movements is unclear and warrants further research.},

  abstract = {Many patients experience nausea and vomiting after surgery, which can be very uncomfortable and may delay recovery. Despite preventive medications, this problem remains common, particularly in women, non-smokers and those with a previous history of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Our research aimed to improve PONV prevention for a quicker, and more comfortable recovery.
  We identified groups more likely to experience PONV, focusing on clinical factors, ethnicity and genetics. Notably, a specific gene (the C allele of P2RX7) may protect against vomiting. We also confirmed that individuals with a prior PONV or motion sickness are at a higher risk of experiencing it again. These insights could guide more personalised PONV prevention strategies in the future.
  Our study also evaluated medicines like olanzapine, aprepitant, and fosaprepitant. Combining certain drugs significantly reduced PONV, while others were less effective. Olanzapine, typically used for mental health conditions, worked well alongside standard treatments, significantly lowering the chances of PONV. However, aprepitant, a drug specifically approved to prevent PONV, did not show much benefit when combined with another drug called palonosetron. After reviewing available studies, we concluded that while these medications help prevent PONV, their effectiveness depends on how they are combined.
  Overall, our findings suggest that we can enhance the prevention of these unpleasant side effects by understanding patient’s individual risk factors and using a combination of medications targeting different factors contributing to PONV. These insights can help improve patient care by making recovery from surgery more comfortable and reducing the risk for complications.},

  abstract = {The presence of a hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease often presents with severe, disabling symptoms and is known to result into a poor quality-of-life for many patients. Nevertheless, it’s often seen by patients and physicians alike as an ailment to be treated by antacids, not as serious disease warranting surgery.  
  While most hiatal hernia are straightforward, in some rare cases the pancreas herniates along with the other organs into the thoracic cavity. Little is known about how to proceed surgically. Furthermore, some patients are hindered in their daily life by symptoms of delayed gastric emptying. Antireflux surgery is known to enhance gastric emptying speeds in most cases. Some patients, however, see their gastric emptying worsened. The mechanism behind this phenomenon remains mostly unclear.  
  When a hiatal hernia recurs or symptoms persist following primary antireflux surgery, a whole battery of diagnostic tests are done to find the mechanism of failure and therefore also the optimal mode of treatment. We hypothesize that computed tomography (CT) scanning of the gastroesphageal junction offers sufficient information to classify the underlying mechanism of failure.
  Current treatment of hiatal hernia is largely standardized in the Netherlands. Most centers perform partial laparoscopic fundoplications. Some centers, however, see benefits in using robotic assistance.  
  And finally, the question remains on how best to treat those patients with severe symptoms and poor quality-of-life following (multiple) previous failed antireflux surgeries and are currently left without any treatment options.  
  The aims of this thesis are to find out why the number of referrals for surgery remain lacking in the Netherlands, to describe our experience with intrathoracic herniation of the pancreas, to find the incidence of delayed gastric emptying in patients with large and small hiatal hernia, to describe the effects of surgery on gastric motility, to look at the value of CT-scanning in patients with recurrent disease, to look at the benefits of robotic assistance in primary and redo antireflux surgery, and to describe the development of a novel robot assisted transthoracic minimal-invasive approach for redo-antireflux surgery.},

  abstract = {The quality of care given by EMS staff is in part monitored by routine review of deployment reports that the providers must complete after each deployment. The assessment consists of determining whether a deployment was performed in a medically correct manner and thus whether the clinical reasoning process was appropriate. The time used during the deployment is also measured, as there are often time limits for performing different parts of the deployment and these must be adhered to. One might question whether measuring the time spent really gives insight into the quality of care, and if it might not be more useful to see how that time was spent. We therefore conceived a study to map the EMS care process and evaluate this process in relation to the time used. We used a focused ethnographic study design. Video recordings of EMS deployments in combination with semi-structured interviews of the EMS providers involved, were thematically analysed. This led to insights into the EMS care process and the embedded clinical reasoning. By categorising the professional activities we identified we were able to define a model that describes in general the EMS care process. We reported the first part of this study in which we developed this so called SPART model in a separate paper. In this second part of the study we determined the execution time within a deployment and measured the frequency of occurrence and the duration of the identified activities. We interpreted the operational content and the time variables both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also determined the distribution of activities over the three deployment operational periods (response, on-scene and transport period). Using the SPART model, we gained insight into the different activities' nature, order, and duration. We could qualitatively judge the effectiveness of the clinical reasoning process, i.e., the quality of care delivered. Generally, the studied cases were followable, and the clinical reasoning process was medically logical. The diagnostic process sometimes continued after the clinical decision, which was not medically logical. Remarkably, this never changed the clinical decision. Although this could negatively affect the quality of care, we found no clinical evidence that this was the case. Our findings demonstrated that the quality of care in EMS can be measured by using the SPART model to evaluate EMS deployments. We concluded that qualitative judgment was more important than quantitative evaluation. Interpreting the order of different activities led to the clearest understanding of the clinical reasoning process. It was concluded that knowledge of the exact time used per activity and, in total, had the least impact on understanding the clinical reasoning process.},

Thirty-six patients undergoing short lasting sedation following cardiac surgery were included to receive propofol to maintain a BIS between 40 and 60. Robustness of control for all groups was analysed using prediction error and spectrographic analysis. Although similar time courses of measured BIS were obtained in all groups, a higher median propofol effect-site concentration (CePROP) was required in the HUMAN group compared to the BAYES and EPSAC groups. The time course analysis of the remifentanil effect-site concentration (CeREMI) revealed a significant increase in CeREMI in the EPSAC group compared to BAYES and HUMAN during the case. Although similar bias and divergence in control was found in all groups, larger control inaccuracy was observed in HUMAN versus EPSAC and BAYES. Spectrographic analysis of the system behavior shows that BAYES covers the largest spectrum of frequencies, followed by EPSAC and HUMAN. Both computer-based control systems are feasible to be used during ICU sedation with overall tighter control than HUMAN and even with lower required CePROP. EPSAC control required higher CeREMI than BAYES or HUMAN to maintain stable control. Clinical trial number: NCT00735631.},

Forty-four quantitative time, frequency and entropy features were extracted from EEG recordings and were used to train the machine learning algorithms on sleep dataset to predict sleep stages in the sedation dataset. The predicted sleep states were then compared with the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/ Sedation (MOAA/S) scores. The performance of the model was poor (AUC = 0.55-0.58) in differentiating sleep stages during propofol and sevoflurane sedation. In the case of dexmedetomidine, the AUC of the model increased in a sedation-dependent manner with NREM stages 2 and 3 highly correlating with deep sedation state reaching an AUC of 0.80. We addressed an important clinical question to identify biological sleep promoting sedatives using EEG signals. We demonstrate that propofol and sevoflurane do not promote EEG patterns resembling natural sleep while dexmedetomidine promotes states resembling NREM stages 2 and 3 sleep, based on current sleep staging standards.},

Secondary outcome was the incidence of postinduction hypotensive events. Mean (SD) percentage of time with Narcotrend Index values ≤ 60 during surgery across all patients receiving remimazolam (93% (20.7)) was non-inferior to propofol (99% (4.2)), mean difference (97.5%CI) -6.28% (-8.89-infinite); p = 0.003.

In conclusion, in patients who were ASA physical status 3 or 4, the anaesthetic effect of remimazolam was non-inferior to propofol.},

One option is to use anaesthetic gas capturing technology at anaesthesia workstation exhausts to harvest and recycle volatile agents. However, the efficiency of such technology is mainly unverified in vivo. The efficiency of CONTRAfluran™ in capturing sevoflurane from an anaesthesia workstation exhaust (when set to minimal flow and end-tidal control mode) was evaluated in 70 adult patients scheduled for general or bariatric laparoscopic surgery. The weight of the sevoflurane vaporiser and CONTRAfluran canister was measured before and after each case, to calculate total sevoflurane consumption and retention. Retention was measured after the minimal flow maintenance phase and after the high flow washout phase. The total retention efficiency was the fraction of all consumed sevoflurane captured by the CONTRAfluran canister. The primary objective was to examine the retention efficiency of CONTRAfluran in a clinical surgical setting, where all feasible strategies to minimise sevoflurane consumption and optimise the efficacy of CONTRAfluran were utilised. The secondary objective was to analyse the correlation between mass transfer and the duration of the case. Mean (SD) volume of sevoflurane captured using CONTRAfluran was 4.82 (1.41) ml, representing 45% (95%CI 42-48%) of all sevoflurane administered. The highest amount of retention was found during the washout phase. Retention efficiency did not correlate with the duration of the case. Over half of the sevoflurane administered was not captured by the CONTRAfluran canister when minimal flow techniques were used, likely due to residual accumulation of sevoflurane in the patient after tracheal extubation or, to a lesser extent, due to ventilation system leakage. However, as every prevented emission is commendable, CONTRAfluran may be a potentially valuable tool for reducing the environmental footprint of sevoflurane-based anaesthesia.},

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a daily prediction model for next-day disease severity in ICU patients. Data from the Simple Intensive Care Studies-II prospective cohort study of acutely admitted critically ill adults, including data collected during the first 7 days of admission such as Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score-related measurements, were used to fit a mixed-effects logistic regression model for next-day deterioration. Deterioration was defined as a decline in the total (≥2) and organ-specific (≥1) SOFA scores. Performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. A total of 1009 patients were included. The final predictive model for overall next-day deterioration included six predictors (the total SOFA score on the current day, the minimum value of arterial pH, Glasgow Coma Scale score, mean arterial blood pressure, mechanical ventilation, and its effect differing between the first and subsequent ICU days). The model achieved an AUC of 0.74 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.78). In the decision curve analysis, within probability thresholds of 0.2-0.5, the model showed a higher net benefit than did strategies of treating all patients or treating no patients. Organ-specific prediction models for next-day deterioration in respiration, cardiovascular, and renal function showed slightly better performance than the overall model (AUCs: 0.79, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively). Daily prediction models can predict next-day disease severity in overall, respiration, cardiovascular, and renal function amongst ICU patients. They offer clinical benefits within a range of probability thresholds and could support decision-making for ICU physicians.},

Although the reasons may be many, the lack of a simplified algorithm for the assessment of DD specific to the perioperative arena, the implications of this diagnosis on clinical care, and the absence of therapeutic options are some of the commonly cited reasons. In this article, the authors address these possible reasons for the lack of routine application of Doppler indices to assess perioperative DD. The authors have chosen to highlight some of the most common conceptual questions, which often have been raised by anesthesiologists, and attempted to suggest answers. Drawing from their experience and data, the authors propose a simplified algorithm for the application of Doppler to assess and diagnose DD with an individualized and a mechanistic approach. The proposed algorithm is from within the premise of the published guidelines and attempts to simplify the perioperative approach. The authors hope this approach will be simple enough for routine application to affect therapy and a tangible change in outcome. The authors suggest that knowledge of left atrial size is valuable as a marker for persistently increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and its possible role in risk stratification.},

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol with sequential nerve blocks on pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain. As a first step a diagnostic, temporary celiac plexus block with local anesthetics was performed. If substantial pain relief was obtained, the assumption was that pain was relayed via the celiac plexus and major splanchnic nerves. When pain recurred, patients were then scheduled for a major splanchnic nerve block with radiofrequency ablation. In cases with no pain relief, it was assumed that pain was relayed via the aortico-renal plexus, and catheter-based renal denervation was performed. Sixty patients were referred, of which 44 were eligible. In 36 patients the diagnostic celiac plexus block resulted in substantial pain relief with a change in the median visual analogue scale (VAS) score pre-post intervention of 50/100. Of these patients, 23 received a major splanchnic nerve block because pain recurred, with a change in median VAS pre-post block of 53/100. In 8 patients without pain relief after the diagnostic block, renal denervation was performed in 5, with a borderline significant change in the median VAS pre-post intervention of 20/100. After a median follow-up of 12 months, 81.8% of the patients experienced a sustained improvement in pain intensity, indicating that our treatment protocol is effective in obtaining pain relief in ADPKD patients with refractory chronic pain.},

The expression of TGF-alpha, EGFr, p53 nuclear protein, and proliferation rate was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and survival after partial liver resection. In liver metastases, TGF-alpha expression was low in 42%, intermediate in 35%, and high in 23%. TGF-alpha expression was higher in liver metastases derived from lymph node-positive primary carcinomas, in synchronous and in irresectable liver metastases compared with those derived from lymph node-negative primary carcinomas, metachronous, and resectable liver metastases. Nuclear p53 expression was found in 83% of primary tumors and 71% of liver metastases. p53 expression did not correlate with the various clinicopathological characteristics. Ki67 expression was not associated with clinicopathological characteristics in primary and metastatic tumors. In the 38 patients in whom a partial liver resection was performed, median survival was 25 months in patients with a higher TGF-alpha expression in the metastasis than in the primary tumor and 60 months in patients with comparable or lower TGF-alpha expression in the metastasis than in the primary tumor (P = .036). Median survival after liver resection was 21 months in patients with p53-negative liver metastases and 58 months in patients with p53-positive metastases (P = .043). By multivariate analysis, p53 and EGFr expression on liver metastases were the best predictors of disease-free survival after partial liver resection, with relative risks of 2.38 and 3.33, respectively. In patients with colorectal liver metastases, referred for liver surgery, a higher TGF-alpha expression is associated with unfavorable tumor characteristics, whereas p53 and absence of EGFr expression is associated with a better survival after partial liver resection.},

We analyzed the long-term efficacy of our innovative multidisciplinary protocol to treat chronic refractory pain that aims to preserve kidney function by applying among other sequential nerve blocks. Patients were eligible if pain was present ≥3 months with a score of ≥50 on a visual analog scale (VAS) of 100, was negatively affecting quality of life and if there had been insufficient response to previous therapies, including opioid treatment. Treatment options were, in order, analgesics, cyst aspiration and fenestration, nerve blocks and nephrectomy. A total of 101 patients were assessed in our clinic (mean age 50 ± 11 years, 65.3% females). Eight patients were treated with medication, 6 by cyst aspiration or fenestration, 63 by nerve blocks and 6 received surgery as the first treatment option. Overall, 76.9% experienced a positive effect on pain complaints shortly after treatment. The VAS score was reduced from 60/100 to 20/100 (P < 0.001) and patients decreased their number of nonopioid and opioid analgesics significantly (P < 0.001, P = 0.01, respectively). A substantial number of the patients (n = 51) needed additional treatment. At the end of follow-up in only 13 patients (12.9%) was surgical intervention necessary: 11 nephrectomies (of which 10 were in patients already on kidney function replacement treatment), 1 liver transplantation and 1 partial hepatectomy. After a median follow-up of 4.5 years (interquartile range 2.5-5.3), 69.0% of the patients still had fewer pain complaints. These data indicate that our multidisciplinary treatment protocol appears effective in reducing pain in the majority of patients with chronic refractory pain, while postponing or even avoiding in most patients surgical interventions such as nephrectomy in most patients.},

During the initial visit (T0), demographic variables, pain intensity, knowledge of the prescription (name, dose, and frequency), self-reported adherence to the prescription, and general knowledge of pharmacological pain therapy (according to the Pain Knowledge Questionnaire, Dutch Language Version (PKQ-DLV) were recorded. During two follow-up visits (T1, T2), apart from demographics, these parameters were measured again. Adherence rates were 42%, 42%, and 46% at T0, T1 and T2, respectively. 53%, 59%, and 48% of patients had knowledge of their current prescription, and mean scores on the PKQ-DLV were 56, 55, and 52 percent of the maximum scores, respectively, at T0, T1 and T2. A multivariate binary logistic regression analysis resulted in a significant contribution of knowledge of the prescription and of age to the prediction of adherence. Knowledge of the analgesic prescription is associated with adherence and significantly contributes to the prediction of adherence to analgesic therapy. An interventional study is needed to determine whether increasing knowledge will improve medication adherence and therapy outcome in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain.},

To develop this protocol with optimized acquisition and processing parameters, we initially aggregated 65 functional imaging datasets acquired from rats across 46 centers. We developed a reproducible pipeline for analyzing rat data acquired with diverse protocols and determined experimental and processing parameters associated with the robust detection of functional connectivity across centers. We show that the standardized protocol enhances biologically plausible functional connectivity patterns relative to previous acquisitions. The protocol and processing pipeline described here is openly shared with the neuroimaging community to promote interoperability and cooperation toward tackling the most important challenges in neuroscience.},

The RIA was positive in 33 of 41 (82.9%) patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) and in 51 of 79 (64.4%) patients with secondary thrombocytopenia (STP). The PIFT was positive in 37 of the 41 (90.2%) ITP patients and in 57 of the 79 (72.2%) STP patients. Sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ITP of both tests were comparable: 82.9 and 40.9% for the PA-IgG(RIA) and 90.2 and 36.7% for the PIFT. A significant positive correlation was observed between the mean amount of PA-IgG measured and the height of PIFT scores with anti-IgG. Of 38 discrepancies between PA-IgG(RIA) and PIFT with anti-IgG, 15 were due to borderline results, 17 were associated with abnormal platelet-size distribution and 20 were associated with occurrence of IgM antibodies. These results suggest influences of platelet fragments and/or aggregates on accurate measurement of PA-IgG. Both fragments and aggregates escape from accurate platelet counting, while their contribution to the total IgG content remains. Therefore, a falsely elevated PA-IgG (RIA) may be measured.},

This review is intended to provide a critical analysis of the available evidence concerning the indications for clinical measurement of indocyanine green elimination as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in two areas: its role in peri-operative liver function monitoring during major hepatic resection and liver transplantation; and its role in critically ill patients on the intensive care unit, where it is used for prediction of mortality, and for assessment of the severity of acute liver failure or that of intra-abdominal hypertension. Although numerous studies have demonstrated that indocyanine green elimination measurements in these patient populations can provide diagnostic or prognostic information to the clinician, 'hard' evidence - i.e. high-quality prospective randomised controlled trials - is lacking, and therefore it is not yet time to give a green light for use of indocyanine green in routine clinical practice.},

In contrast, the Nexfin(®) device provides continuous non-invasive measurement of MAP (MAPcNIAP) using a finger cuff. We explored the agreement of MAPcNIAP and MAPiNIAP with the gold standard: continuous invasive MAP measurement by placement of a radial artery catheter (MAPinvasive). In a total of 120 patients undergoing elective general surgery and clinically requiring MAPinvasive measurement, MAPiNIAP and MAPcNIAP were measured in a 30 min time period at an arbitrary moment during surgery with stable haemodynamics. MAPiNIAP was measured every 5 min. Data from 112 patients were analysed. Compared with MAPinvasive, modified Bland-Altman analysis revealed a bias (sd) of 2 (9) mm Hg for MAPcNIAP and -2 (12) mm Hg for MAPiNIAP. Percentage errors for MAPcNIAP and MAPiNIAP were 22% and 32%, respectively. In a haemodynamically stable phase in patients undergoing general anaesthesia, the agreement with invasive MAP of continuous non-invasive measurement using a finger cuff was not inferior to the agreement of intermittent arm cuff oscillometry. Continuous measurements using a finger cuff can interchangeably be used as an alternative for intermittent arm cuff oscillometry in haemodynamically stable patients, with the advantage of beat-to-beat haemodynamic monitoring.

  abstract = {1. Many poultry houses are illuminated by fluorescent lamps which produce discontinuous illumination with a frequency of either 100 or 120 Hz. 2. This study investigated whether domestic fowls perceive this discontinuity as flicker by training two Leghorn hens to choose between a continuous and a discontinuous light, all other variables being identical. 3. The light-stimulus was either monochromatic with 100% sinusoidal modulation or a fluorescent lamp whose modulation frequency could be electrically adjusted. 4. Each (correct) choice for the discontinuous light was followed by a 5 Hz higher frequency, whereas an incorrect choice was followed by a 10 Hz lower frequency. 5. On the basis of this principle the animals themselves established the highest perceivable frequency of the discontinuous light, called the Critical Fusion Frequency (CFF), that they could discriminate from continuous light. 6. These frequencies typically depend on the stimulus intensity increasing with increasing intensities, until a maximum value is reached. 7. Two factors limited the magnitudes of the CFF's that were recorded: the maximum stimulus intensities produced and variability in the chicken's response ("behavioural noise"). In spite of these constraints 105 Hz was established as the maximum CFF. 8. On the basis of extrapolation it is concluded that the direct light from fluorescent lamps driven by 50 Hz alternating current is seen by the chicken as flickering. 9. The results justify large-scale comparison of behaviour and production in poultry houses that are illuminated either by low-frequency or by high-frequency fluorescent lamps.},

Retrospective observational study. Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands, over a 14-year period from January 2005 to December 2018. The study included 99 consecutive patients with simple dextro-transposition of the great arteries with or without a ventricular septal defect. All patients received preoperative management including intravenous prostaglandin E1 and, when necessary, a balloon atrial septostomy. Patients were then scheduled for an arterial switch operation. Patients were divided into a PPHN and a non-PPHN group. The outcomes assessed included mortality (overall, preoperative, 30-day postoperative and late mortality) and postoperative morbidity (length of ventilatory support, intensive care unit and hospital stay, delayed sternal closure and resternotomy). PPHN was present in 31% of patients. Overall mortality was 8.1%, with no difference between PPHN and non-PPHN patients (9.7 v 7.4%, p = 0.70). PPHN had no effect on morbidity outcomes. A lower weight at birth was associated with preoperative mortality. Duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and intraoperative hypotension were associated with longer intensive care unit stay. Intraoperative hypotension and cerebral oxygen desaturation had no significant impact on mortality. PPHN did not significantly affect perioperative morbidity and mortality in d-TGA patients, suggesting a more favorable prognosis than previously reported.},

  abstract = {Two centuries ago, Goethe wrote in his Farbenlehre about blue as a receding colour, against yellow/red as a colour 'piercing into the organ'. Though any verification of these psychological attributes seems to be absent, this depth effect in colour still seems to be taken for granted in art history. In visual science, the completely different and far better documented colour stereoscopic effect, known as chromostereopsis, prevails. A historical account is given of the development of ideas about this chromostereopsis, often by amusing trials and errors. The original explanation by Bruecke in terms of chromatic aberration (in present-day literature usually indicated as transverse chromatic aberration) and a temporal off-axis position of the fovea still forms the basis of present-day understanding, even though Bruecke rejected his own explanation. It had to be complemented by an additional off-axis effect of the pupil, not in an anatomical sense, as Einthoven presumed but failed to find but in a functional sense by a non-centric Stiles-Crawford effect. Although a comprehensive individual experimental proof is still missing, the evidence available indicates that a satisfactory quantitative explanation has been reached.},

The association of compliance with perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols and postoperative outcomes is unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of protocol compliance on postoperative outcomes following high-risk surgery, after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol. Through a before-after study design, patients undergoing elective high-risk surgery before (before-group) and after implementation of a perioperative goal-directed therapy protocol (after-group) were included. Perioperative goal-directed therapy in the after-group consisted of optimized stroke volume variation or stroke volume index and optimized cardiac index. Additionally, the association of protocol compliance with postoperative complications when using perioperative goal-directed therapy was assessed. High protocol compliance was defined as ≥ 85% of the procedure time spent within the individual targets. The difference in complications during the first 30 postoperative days before and after implementation of the protocol was assessed. In the before-group, 214 patients were included and 193 patients in the after-group. The number of complications was higher in the before-group compared to the after-group (n = 414 vs. 282; p = 0.031). In the after-group, patients with high protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index had less complications compared to patients with low protocol compliance for stroke volume variation or stroke volume index (n = 187 vs. 90; p = 0.01). Protocol compliance by the attending clinicians is essential and should be monitored to facilitate an improvement in postoperative outcomes desired by the implementation of perioperative goal-directed therapy protocols.},

We compared the ability of APW-based variations in stroke volume (SVV) and pulse pressure (PPV) and of PW-based plethysmographic variability index (PVI) to predict fluid responsiveness and to track fluid changes in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Furthermore, we assessed whether the PPV/SVV ratio, as a measure of dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn), could predict a reduction in norepinephrine requirement after fluid administration. Thirty patients received i.v. fluid (15 ml kg(-1) in 30 min) after hepatic resection and were considered responders when stroke volume index (SVI) increased ≥20% after fluid administration. SVV and SVI were measured by the FloTrac-Vigileo(®) device, and PVI was measured by the Masimo Radical 7 pulse co-oximeter(®). The areas under a receiver operating characteristic curve for SVV, PPV, and PVI were 0.81, 0.77, and 0.78, respectively. In responders, all dynamic variables, except PVI, decreased after fluid administration. Eadyn predicted a reduced norepinephrine requirement (AUC = 0.81). In patients undergoing major hepatic resection, both APW- and PW-based dynamic preload variables predict fluid responsiveness (preload) to a similar extent. Most variables (except PVI) also tracked fluid changes. Eadyn, as a measure of arterial elastance (afterload), might be helpful to distinguish the origin of hypotension.

  abstract = {Thermal cataract has long been known as an occupational disease in furnace workers. This affliction has virtually disappeared in western countries due to improved working conditions. However, new light sources have appeared on the scene, in particular lasers, which might also be capable of producing thermal cataract. The aim of this survey is to review the history and describe the present state of knowledge. Experimental work, mainly on rabbits, was reviewed and complemented with the results of calculations on the thermal changes in the ocular media. Safe exposure limits were derived over the optical spectrum from the near ultraviolet to the far infrared. Lasers may be a cause of thermal cataract only in the near ultraviolet. Moreover, in this field of research too, it is concluded that science may be regarded as the present state of misunderstanding.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis characterises the existing efficacy and safety data of PCC use in LT. This review was registered (PROSPERO CRD#42024561866). MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to 30 May 2024. Studies in adults undergoing LT where PCC exposure was reported in relation to clinical outcomes were included. Random effects models were used to obtain pooled effect estimates. All studies were retrospective, with seven reporting the number of patients receiving PCC [392/1901 (21%)], and one grouping patients receiving different factor concentrates together [576/939 (61%)]. Patients receiving PCC had worse preoperative coagulopathy, model for end-stage liver disease scores, and comorbidities. Patients exposed to PCC had a comparable mean number of red blood cell (RBC), plasma, or platelet units transfused. Use of viscoelastic testing-based algorithms incorporating PCC compared with usual care was associated with reduced odds of RBC exposure (odds ratio [OR]: 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-0.86, I Although there are no randomised trials comparing use of PCC vs FP in LT, their efficacy and safety appear comparable. Higher-quality studies are needed to assess PCC use for coagulopathic bleeding in LT.},

We recommend basing intra-operative arterial pressure management on mean arterial pressure and keeping intra-operative mean arterial pressure above 60 mmHg. We further recommend identifying the underlying causes of intra-operative hypotension and addressing them appropriately. We suggest pragmatically treating bradycardia or tachycardia when it leads to profound hypotension or likely results in reduced cardiac output, oxygen delivery or organ perfusion. We suggest monitoring stroke volume or cardiac output in patients with high baseline risk for complications or in patients having high-risk surgery to assess the haemodynamic status and the haemodynamic response to therapeutic interventions. However, we recommend not routinely maximising stroke volume or cardiac output in patients having noncardiac surgery. Instead, we suggest defining stroke volume and cardiac output targets individually for each patient considering the clinical situation and clinical and metabolic signs of tissue perfusion and oxygenation. We recommend not giving fluids simply because a patient is fluid responsive but only if there are clinical or metabolic signs of hypovolaemia or tissue hypoperfusion. We suggest monitoring and optimising the depth of anaesthesia to titrate doses of anaesthetic drugs and reduce their side effects.},

Patients with critical limb ischemia are at increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events and subsequent cardiovascular death. Little is known about the incidence and consequences of these adverse events. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adverse cardiac events on mortality in patients with critical limb ischemia undergoing surgical or endovascular treatment. A retrospective cohort study including all patients with critical limb ischemia aged ≥65 undergoing surgical or endovascular treatment for critical limb ischemia between January 2013 and June 2018 was conducted. Data on adverse cardiac events were collected from medical records. The effect of an adverse cardiac event on mortality during 6 months follow-up was analyzed with a multivariable cox proportional hazards model to adjust for confounders. Effects are displayed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total number of 449 patients were included. Median age was 76 years, 52.8% of patients were male. In total, 51 patients (11%) developed an adverse cardiac event, 31 patients (10%) in the surgical group and 20 patients (14%) in the endovascular group. After adjustment for confounders, adverse cardiac events were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 3.5 95% CI 2.1-5.9). This study showed that adverse cardiac events commonly occur in elderly patients with critical limb ischemia. Adverse cardiac events continue to occur even months after treatment and are associated with an increased mortality risk. These findings justify routine cardiac evaluation in both surgical and endovascular treatment. Additionally, frequent postdischarge cardiac follow-up in the outpatient clinic may be helpful in limiting the occurrence of adverse cardiac events.},

  abstract = {Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) very commonly accompanies general anaesthesia in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. The development of IOH is unwanted, since it is associated with adverse outcomes such as acute kidney injury and myocardial injury, stroke and mortality. Although the definition of IOH is variable, harm starts to occur below a mean arterial pressure (MAP) threshold of 65 mmHg. The odds of adverse outcome increase for increasing duration and/or magnitude of IOH below this threshold, and even short periods of IOH seem to be associated with adverse outcomes. Therefore, reducing the hypotensive burden by predicting and preventing IOH through proactive appropriate treatment may potentially improve patient outcome. In this review article, we summarise the current state of the prediction of IOH by the use of so-called machine-learning algorithms. Machine-learning algorithms that use high-fidelity data from the arterial pressure waveform, may be used to reveal 'traits' that are unseen by the human eye and are associated with the later development of IOH. These algorithms can use large datasets for 'training', and can subsequently be used by clinicians for haemodynamic monitoring and guiding therapy. A first clinically available application, the hypotension prediction index (HPI), is aimed to predict an impending hypotensive event, and additionally, to guide appropriate treatment by calculated secondary variables to asses preload (dynamic preload variables), contractility (dP/dt},

A comparison is made of these guidelines, embedded in a short sketch of the history. They are illustrated by examples of applications. In most cases the HCN guidelines produce results that hardly deviate from those obtained with the ACGIH guidelines but in some cases the results diverge and in other cases HCN gives an answer where ACGIH seems to fall short.

Therefore, we evaluated whether induced hypo- and hypervolaemia result in changes in central blood volumes (pulmonary blood volume (PBV), intrathoracic blood volume (ITBV)) and we explored the effects on the distribution between these central blood volumes and circulating blood volume (Vd circ). Six anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing Foxhound dogs underwent random blood volume alterations in steps of 150 ml (mild) to 450 ml (moderate), either by haemorrhage, retransfusion of blood, or colloid infusion. PBV, ITBV and Vd circ were measured using (transpulmonary) dye dilution. The PBV/Vd circ ratio and the ITBV/Vd circ ratio were used as an assessment of blood volume distribution. 68 blood volume alterations resulted in changes in Vdcirc ranging from -33 to +31%. PBV and ITBV decreased during mild and moderate haemorrhage, while during retransfusion, PBV and ITBV increased during moderate hypervolaemia only. The PBV/Vd circ ratio remained constant during all stages of hypo- and hypervolaemia (mean values between 0.20-0.22). This was also true for the ITBV/Vd circ ratio, which remained between 0.31 and 0.32, except for moderate hypervolaemia, where it increased slightly to 0.33 (0.02), P<0.05. Mild to moderate blood volume alterations result in changes of Vd circ, PBV and ITBV. The ratio between the central blood volumes and Vd circ generally remained unaltered. Therefore, it could be suggested that in anaesthetized spontaneously breathing dogs, the cardiovascular system maintains the distribution of blood between central and circulating blood volume.},

MAP, HR, SV, CI, SctO2, SptO2 and rate-pressure product (RPP) analysed from 30 s before drug administration until 240 s thereafter. Phenylephrine and norepinephrine caused an equivalent increase in MAP [Δ = 13 (8 to 22) and Δ = 13 (9 to 19) mmHg, respectively] and SV [Δ = 6 ± 6 and Δ = 5 ± 7 ml, respectively], combined with a significant equivalent decrease in HR (both Δ = -8 ± 6 bpm), CI (both Δ = -0.2 ± 0.3 l min(-1) m(-2)) and SctO2 and an unchanged RPP (Δ = 345 ± 876 and Δ = 537 ± 1076 mmHg min(-1)).

The primary absorber is melanin. Photochemical damage occurs at body temperature and involves cellular damage by reactive forms of oxygen. The photosensitizers are photoproducts of the visual pigments. First indications that non-thermal damage might exist, in particular in the case of eclipse blindness, was presented by Vos in 1962. Attribution thereof to photochemical action was presented in 1966 by Noell et al who also measured the first action spectrum, in rat. It turned out to be identical to the absorption spectrum of rhodopsin. However, in 1976 and 1982 Ham et al found a quite different spectrum in monkeys, peaking at short wavelengths. The latter spectrum, but not the former, was confirmed since in numerous publications with animal models including rat. In ophthalmological practice a 'sunburn' was at first the only complaint caused by light damage. To avoid this, patients with dilated pupils should always be advised to wear sunglasses. Since the invention of the laser accidents have been reported, the most recent development is youth playfully pointing a strong laser pen in their eyes with marked consequences. The operation microscope and endoilluminators should always be used as brief as possible to avoid photochemical damage. Arguments for implant lenses that block not only the UV but also part of the visible spectrum seem too weak to justify extra costs.},

The amount of PA-IgG of washed, unfixed normal donor platelets was 1.0 +/- 0.9 fg IgG/platelet (mean +/- 2 SD). Upon storage of washed platelets in a buffer containing EDTA, the amount decreased significantly to 0.2 +/- 0.2 fg IgG/platelet. Simultaneously, an increase in modal platelet volume was observed. Similar results were obtained when platelets were fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA). We postulate that this decrease in PA-IgG is caused by the release of plasma IgG entrapped by the surface-connected canicular system of the platelet, when the platelets swell during storage in EDTA or fixation with PFA. This presence of varying amounts of entrapped plasma IgG may cause the wide discrepancies in PA-IgG found in normal donor platelets as well as platelets from ITP patients by other investigators. A good quantification of platelet-bound alloantibodies was possible with our assay when platelets were routinely fixed to diminish the amount of nonspecific PA-IgG. This was demonstrated with different anti-Zwa (= anti-PlA1), anti-Baka and anti-HLA sera. We also observed that fragments of platelets as well as fragments of cells of other types can cause aspecifically increased Pa-IgG values and can thus interfere with the proper measurement of platelet-bound antibodies in all kinds of immunoassays in general.},

  abstract = {Ensuring and maintaining adequate tissue oxygenation at the microcirculatory level might be considered the holy grail of optimal hemodynamic patient management. However, in clinical practice we usually focus on macro-hemodynamic variables such as blood pressure, heart rate, and sometimes cardiac output. Other macro-hemodynamic variables like pulse pressure or stroke volume variation are additionally used as markers of fluid responsiveness. In recent years, an increasing number of technological devices assessing tissue oxygenation or microcirculatory blood flow have been developed and validated, and some of them have already been incorporated into clinical practice. In this review, we will summarize recent research findings on this topic as published in the last 2 years in the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing (JCMC). While some techniques are already currently used as routine monitoring (e.g. cerebral oxygenation using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)), others still have to find their way into clinical practice. Therefore, further research is needed, particularly regarding outcome measures and cost-effectiveness, since introducing new technology is always expensive and should be balanced by downstream savings. The JCMC is glad to provide a platform for such research.},

When all three tests were considered, positive results were obtained for 92.0% of the ITP patients with a platelet count of less than 150 X 10(9)/l and for 98.4% of the patients with a count of less than 100 X 10(9)/l. However, for many patients rather weak test results were obtained, with a score of 1/2-1 in 59.8% of the patients. Most patients (94.1%) with a positive direct test had a positive indirect test on the eluate. Thus, platelet-bound antibodies but not platelet-bound immune complexes were present in most, if not all, patients. Positive immunofluorescence tests were obtained for many patients with a diagnosis other than ITP. This resulted in a low specificity of the test for the diagnosis of ITP, evidently because autoimmune thrombocytopenia occurred together with many other diseases and also because antibodies against platelet cryptantigens (expressed by the action of EDTA or by platelet fixation) were present in many patients.},

The majority of these papers investigated the use of either cerebral or peripheral tissue oxygen saturation, derived non-invasively using near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). In some of these studies, the microcirculation was "provocated" by inducing short-term tissue hypoxia, allowing the assessment of functional microvascular reserve. Additionally, studies on technical differences between NIRS monitors are summarized, as well as studies investigating the feasibility of NIRS monitoring, mainly in the pediatric patient population. Last but not least, novel monitoring tools allow assessing oxygenation at a (sub)cellular level, and those papers incorporating these techniques are also reviewed here.},

Structured interviews (n = 27) and questionnaires (n = 84) were conducted to explore clinicians' beliefs and barriers to IOH treatment, in addition to usefulness of HPI questionnaires (n = 14). 150 elective major surgical patients who required invasive blood pressure monitoring were included in three cohorts to assess incidence and time-weighted average (TWA) of hypotension (MAP < 65 mmHg).

  abstract = {In the 1920s and 1930s, disability glare was a topic of great interest in the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE). The Second World War prevented agreement being reached on a standard to quantify disability glare but the Stiles-Holladay formula was widely accepted as such. In 1983, CIE started a new effort to develop a CIE standard making use of research data published in the post-war years. A committee was formed that agreed that new data and insights justified an extension of the angular domain of a disability glare formula and allowed introduction of an age factor and allowance for ocular pigmentation. Three disability glare equations were formulated, each for an appropriately restricted angular domain. The most general, the CIE General Disability Glare equation, covers the full angular range between 0.1 degrees and 100 degrees but for optometrists the CIE Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay Disability Glare equation, with validity domain between one degree and 30 degrees, will often suffice. Disability glare is due to intraocular scatter and obeys, in the one-degree to 30-degree angular domain, albeit with great individual spread, the Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay equation: (L(veil) /E(glare))(Age-adjusted Stiles-Holladay) = 10 (1 + [Age/70](4)).1/theta(2). Quantitative examples are given of the manifestation of disability glare, particularly in traffic.},

Thirty patients undergoing major hepatic resection were included and randomized to receive a fluid bolus of 15 ml kg(-1) colloid (n=15) or crystalloid (n=15) solution over 30 min. SpHb was continuously measured on the index finger, and venous blood samples were analysed in both the steady-state phase (from induction until completion of parenchymal transection) and the dynamic phase (during fluid bolus). Correlation was significant between SpHb and Hb(satlab) (R(2)=0.50, n=543). The modified Bland-Altman analysis for repeated measurements showed a bias (precision) of -0.27 (1.06) and -0.02 (1.07) g dl(-1) for the steady-state and dynamic phases, respectively. SpHb accuracy increased when Hb(satlab) was <10 g dl(-1), with a bias (precision) of 0.41 (0.47) vs -0.26 (1.12) g dl(-1) for values >10 g dl(-1), but accuracy decreased after colloid administration (R(2)=0.25). SpHb correlated moderately with Hb(satlab) with a slight underestimation in both phases in patients undergoing major hepatic resection. Accuracy increased for lower Hb(satlab) values but decreased in the presence of colloid solution. Further improvements are necessary to improve device accuracy under these conditions, so that SpHb might become a sensitive screening device for clinically significant anaemia.},

In this prospective validation intervention study, 20 healthy volunteers were breathing standardized oxygen concentrations ranging from mild hypoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 0.14) to hyperoxia (fraction of inspired oxygen = 1.0) via a tight-fitting face mask. ORi was measured noninvasively by multiwavelength pulse co-oximetry using 2 finger sensors. These ORi values (unitless scale, 0.00-1.00) were compared with measured PaO2 values. Repeated-measurements correlation analysis was performed to assess the ORi/PaO2 relationship. ORi trending ability was assessed using a 4-quadrant plot. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated to assess the prediction of hypoxia (low-ranged PaO2, <100 mm Hg). Within the ORi-sensitive range, a strong positive correlation was found between ORi and PaO2 for both sensors (R = 0.78 and 0.83; P < .0001). ORi trending of PaO2 was good within this range (concordance rate = 94%). The prediction of PaO2 <100 mm Hg was also good, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.91 and 99% sensitivity and 82% specificity. In this prospective volunteer validation study, a strong and positive correlation between PaO2 and ORi was found, together with a good trending ability. Based on these data, the future use of ORi as a continuous noninvasive monitoring tool for assessing oxygenation status in patients receiving supplemental oxygen might be supported.},

PDRICG was measured non-invasively by pulse dye densitometry during surgery and was correlated with initial graft function. At the end of surgery, PDRICG was higher in patients without complications: 24.9 % min(-1) (n = 40) versus 21.0 % min(-1), (n = 22; p = 0.034). An area under the ROC curve (AUROC) for PDRICG was 0.70, while the AUROC for pH, lactate and PT at ICU admission were 0.53, 0.50 and 0.46, respectively. The AUROC of serum bilirubin and PT at postoperative day 5 were 0.68 and 0.49, respectively.

There is a need for perioperative treatment protocols aiming at improving tissue oxygenation (StO2).

Furthermore, we evaluated the feasibility of the optimisation algorithm used. We randomized 50 high-risk patients, all >65 years with ASA physical status III, who underwent major abdominal surgery under standardized balanced general anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia. Throughout surgery StO2 was monitored at the thenar eminence using near-infrared spectroscopy. All patients were treated according to a standard care algorithm. In addition, patients in the intervention group were treated with dobutamine if necessary to keep or raise StO2 ≥ 80%. Data were recorded continuously and complications were recorded during hospital stay with a maximum of 28 days. The number of complications was not significantly different between groups (11 vs 20; p = 0.23). Eleven patients in the intervention group had no complication, versus 7 in the control group. There was no significant difference between groups in length of stay in ICU or in hospital. Only ten patients in the intervention group received dobutamine. Administration of dobutamine resulted in a moderate 6 [-3 to 10] % increase of StO2. The overall protocol adherence was 94%. No statistically significant difference in outcome was realized through intraoperative optimization of StO2 values in this pilot study. The protocol used may be considered feasible for clinical practice. Further research is obligatory to define both the optimal StO2 threshold and intervention to treat tissue hypoperfusion.

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a mathematical model for mitral annular dilatation simulation and determine its effects on the individualized mitral valve (MV) coaptation reserve index (CRI). A retrospective analysis of intraoperative transesophageal 3-dimensionalechocardiographic MV datasets was performed. A mathematical model was created to assess the mitral CRI for each leaflet segment (A1-P1, A2-P2, A3-P3). Mitral CRI was defined as the ratio between the coaptation reserve (measured coaptation length along the closure line) and an individualized correction factor. Indexing was chosen to correct for MV sphericity and area of largest valve opening. Mathematical models were created to simulate progressive mitral annular dilatation and to predict the effect on the individual mitral CRI. At a single-center academic hospital. Twenty-five patients with normally functioning MVs undergoing cardiac surgery. None. Direct measurement of leaflet coaptation along the closure line showed the lowest amount of coaptation (reserve) near the commissures (A1-P1 0.21 ± 0.05 cm and A3-P3 0.22 ± 0.06 cm), and the highest amount of coaptation (reserve) at region A2 to P2 0.25 ± 0.06 cm. After indexing, the A2-to-P2 region was the area with the lowest CRI in the majority of patients, and also the area with the least resistance to mitral regurgitation (MR) occurrence after simulation of progressive annular dilation. Quantification and indexing of mitral coaptation reserve along the closure line are feasible. Indexing and mathematical simulation of progressive annular dilatation consistently showed that indexed coaptation reserve was lowest in the A2-to-P2 region. These results may explain why this area is prone to lose coaptation and is often affected in MR.},

The interest in using minimally invasive cardiac output monitors is growing. The purpose of this review is to discuss the currently available devices to provide an overview of their validation studies in order to answer the question whether these devices are ready for implementation in clinical practice. Current evidence shows that minimally invasive cardiac output monitoring devices are not yet interchangeable with (trans)pulmonary thermodilution in measuring cardiac output. However, validation studies are generally single centre, are based on small sample sizes in heterogeneous groups, and differ in the statistical methods used. Minimally and noninvasive monitoring devices may not be sufficiently accurate to replace (trans)pulmonary thermodilution in estimating cardiac output. The current paradigm shift to explore trending ability rather than investigating agreement of absolute values alone is to be applauded. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of these devices in the context of (functional) haemodynamic monitoring before adoption into clinical practice can be recommended.},

Few studies have examined the effectiveness of predicting FR according to the definition of FR, and assessment of inconclusive values of PPV and SVV around the cut-off value (the "grey zone") might improve individual FR prediction. We explored the ability of noninvasive volume clamp derived measurements of PPV and SVV to predict FR using the grey zone approach, and we assessed the influence of multiple thresholds on the predictive ability of the numerical definition of FR. Ninety patients undergoing general surgery were included in this prospective observational study and received a 500 mL fluid bolus as deemed clinically required by the attending anesthesiologist. A minimal relative increase in stroke volume index (↑SVI) was used to define FR with different thresholds from 10-25%. The PPV, SVV, and SVI were measured using the Nexfin® device that employs noninvasive volume clamp plethysmography. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve gradually increased for PPV / SVV with higher threshold values (from 0.818 / 0.760 at 10% ↑SVI to 0.928 / 0.944 at 25% ↑SVI). The grey zone limits of both PPV and SVV changed from 9-16% (PPV) and 5-13% (SVV) at the 10% ↑SVI threshold to 18-21% (PPV) and 14-16% (SVV) at the 25% ↑SVI threshold. Noninvasive PPV and SVV measurements allow an acceptable FR prediction, although the reliability of both variables is dependent on the intended increase in SVI, which improves substantially with concomitant smaller grey zones at higher ↑SVI thresholds.},

We aimed to assess agreement of somatic and renal near-infrared spectroscopy with reference blood samples. O3 sensors were placed bilaterally on the quadriceps and flank of 26 healthy volunteers. A stepped, controlled hypoxia sequence was performed by adding a mixture of nitrogen and room air to the breathing circuit. O3-derived oxygen saturation values were obtained at baseline and at six decremental saturation levels (5% steps). Blood samples (radial artery, iliac vein (somatic reference) and renal vein) were obtained at each step. Reference values were calculated as: 0.7 × venous saturation + 0.3 × arterial saturation. The agreement between O3-derived values with blood reference values was assessed by calculating root-mean-square error accuracy and Bland-Altman plots. The root-mean-square error accuracy was 6.0% between quadriceps oxygen saturation and somatic reference values. The mean bias was 0.8%, with limits of agreement from -7.7 to 9.3%. These were 5.1% and 0.6% (-8.3 to 9.5%) for flank oxygen saturation and somatic reference values, respectively, and 7.7% and -4.9% (-15.0 to 5.2%) for flank oxygen saturation and renal reference values. The kidney depth was 3.1 ± 0.9 cm below the skin. O3 regional oximetry can be used on the quadriceps and flank to monitor somatic saturation, yet has a saturation-level dependent bias. O3-derived values obtained at the flank underestimated renal reference values. Additionally, it is unlikely that the flank sensors did directly measure renal tissue.

To reduce the risk, blood pressure is closely measured during general anesthesia, and norepinephrine (NE) is frequently administered if hypotension is detected. Despite its routine application, information on the dose-exposure-response relationship of NE remains limited. Additionally, quantification of the influence of general anesthesia on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of NE is lacking. In this study, we aimed to describe NE PK in healthy volunteers and the influence of general anesthesia on its PK. A single-center, cross-over study was conducted in healthy volunteers. The volunteers received a step-up NE dosing scheme (0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.16 and 0.20 mcg A total of 1219 samples were analyzed from 36 volunteers. A two-compartment model with a first-order elimination best described the data. Weight, age, and session effect (awake vs general anesthesia) were identified as relevant covariates on the clearance (CL) of NE. A 10% decrease in NE CL was observed after general anesthesia induction. This difference between sessions is better explained by the measured concentration of propofol, rather than the anticipated impact of cardiac output. The estimated post-stimulation NE concentration is 0.66 nmol/L The NE PK is well described with a two-compartment model with a first-order elimination. NE CL exhibiting a 10% decrease under general anesthesia, with this difference being attributed to the measured concentration of propofol.

In addition, optimal surgical conditions and safe and fast emergence are pivotal parts of anesthetic management. In high-antinociceptive propofol/remifentanil anesthesia with bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 60, norepinephrine was administered to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 80% of individual baseline. Fluid was administered if the ∆ plethysmographic waveform amplitude exceeded 10%. Surgical and recovery conditions, hemodynamic responses, and tissue oxygenation were investigated. Mean (SD) StO2 at the left thenar eminence increased from 83 (6)% before to 86 (4)% 20 min after induction of anesthesia (p <0.05). Cardiac index dropped from 3.0 (0.7) to 2.1 (0.4) L min(-1) (p <0.05), MAP from 109 (16) to 83 (14) mm Hg, and heart rate from 73 (12) to 54 (8) bpm (p <0.05). Thirteen out of 40 patients received a fluid bolus. The median (range) norepinephrine administration rate was 0.05 (0.0-0.10) μg kg(-1) min(-1).

To determine the feasibility, reproducibility and validity of the Shuttle Test (ST) to measure exercise capacity in people with stroke. Longitudinal study design. Rehabilitation department, day care centres from a nursing home and private practices specialized in neuro rehabilitation. People with subacute or chronic stroke. A standardized protocol was used to determine feasibility, reproducibility and validity of the 10-meter Shuttle Test (10mST). Number of shuttles completed, 1stVentilatory Threshold (1stVT). The associations of the number of shuttles completed and cardiopulmonary capacity as measured with a portable gas analyser were r > 0.7, confirming good convergent validity in subacute and chronic people with stroke. Criterion validity, however, indicates it is not a valid test for measuring maximal cardiopulmonary capacity (VO2max). Only 60% of participants were able to reach the 1stVT. Higher cardiopulmonary capacity and a higher total score of the lower extremity Motricity Index contributed significantly to a higher number of shuttles walked (p = 0.001). The Shuttle Test may be a safe and useful exercise test for people after stroke, but may not be appropriate for use with people who walk slower than 2 km/h or 0.56 m/s.},

The micro-fluid challenge (micro-FC; rapid central infusion of 50 ml) and the extrasystolic method utilising post-extrasystolic preload increases may predict fluid responsiveness. Two study windows during coronary artery bypass graft surgery were defined, 1: After anaesthesia induction until surgical incision, 2: Left internal mammarian artery surgical preparation period. Each window consisted of 10-15 min observation for extrasystoles before a micro-FC was performed, after which a traditional fluid challenge (FC) was performed (5 ml/kg). Extrasystolic and micro-FC induced changes in hemodynamic variables were derived as predictors of fluid responsiveness defined as stroke volume increasing > 10% following FC. 61 patients were studied. Post-ectopic changes in pulse pressure (PP) predicted fluid responsiveness with receiver operating characteristic area (AUC) of 0.69 [CI 0.40;0.97] in the first study window and 0.64 [0.44;0.86] in the second window. Other post-ectopic predictors such as pre-ejection period (PEP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) had similar or lower AUCs. Heart rate was 52.9 (SD ±8.4) min},

  abstract = {The exact onset of brain injury in infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) is unknown. Our aim was, therefore, to assess the association between prenatal Doppler flow patterns, postnatal cerebral oxygenation and short-term neurological outcome. Prenatally, we measured pulsatility indices of the middle cerebral (MCA-PI) and umbilical artery (UA-PI) and calculated cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). After birth, cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO2) and fractional tissue oxygen extraction (FTOE) were assessed during the first 3 days after birth, and during and for 24 hours after every surgical procedure within the first 3 months after birth. Neurological outcome was determined preoperatively and at 3 months of age by assessing general movements and calculating the Motor Optimality Score (MOS). Thirty-six infants were included. MOS at 3 months was associated with MCA-PI (rho 0.41, P = 0.04), UA-PI (rho -0.39, P = 0.047, and CPR (rho 0.50, P = 0.01). Infants with abnormal MOS had lower MCA-PI (P = 0.02) and CPR (P = 0.01) and higher UA-PI at the last measurement (P = 0.03) before birth. In infants with abnormal MOS, rcSO2 tended to be lower during the first 3 days after birth, and FTOE was significantly higher on the second day after birth (P = 0.04). Intraoperative and postoperative rcSO2 and FTOE were not associated with short-term neurological outcome. In infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD, the prenatal period may play an important role in developmental outcome. Additional research is needed to clarify the relationship between preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative cerebral oxygenation and developmental outcome in infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD.},

We present the case of a 55-year-old man undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery for severe MR caused by posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe MR with no significant aortic valve abnormalities. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) initially showed a high transvalvular aortic gradient (3 m/s) in the transgastric long-axis view, suggestive of mild-to-moderate AS. However, detailed Doppler analysis revealed a double envelope signal, representing both eccentric MR and true aortic valve flow. The closer evaluation showed the MR signal occurred earlier in the cardiac cycle, aligning with its hemodynamic timing, while the true aortic flow followed isovolumetric contraction. Subsequent three-dimensional TEE confirmed normal aortic valve morphology and function. This case highlights the importance of correlating preoperative findings, Doppler signal timing, and imaging data to avoid misdiagnosis. Systematic echocardiographic evaluation, including signal timing analysis, can differentiate between MR and AS, ensuring accurate intraoperative decision-making and preventing unnecessary interventions.},

  abstract = {Individuals can make choices based on information learned from others, a phenomenon called social learning. How observers differentiate between which individual they should or should not learn from is, however, poorly understood. Here, we showed that Drosophila melanogaster females can influence the choice of egg-laying site of other females through pheromonal marking. Mated females mark territories of high quality food by ejecting surplus male sperm containing the aggregation pheromone cis-11-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) and, in addition, deposit several sex- and species-specific cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) pheromones. These pheromonal cues affect the choices of other females, which respond by preferentially laying eggs on the marked food. This system benefits both senders and responders, as communal egg laying increases offspring survival. Virgin females, however, do not elicit a change in the egg-laying decision of mated females, even when food has been supplemented with ejected sperm from mated females, thus indicating the necessity for additional cues. Genetic ablation of either a female's CHC pheromones or those of their mate results in loss of ability of mated females to attract other females. We conclude that mated females use a pheromonal marking system, comprising cVA acquired from male ejaculate with sex- and species-specific CHCs produced by both mates, to indicate egg-laying sites. This system ensures information reliability because mated, but not virgin, females have both the ability to generate the pheromone blend that attracts other flies to those sites and a direct interest in egg-laying site quality.},

Initiation of venoarterial ExtraCorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) during resuscitation might improve outcomes if used in time and in a selected patient category. However, previous studies have failed to significantly reduce the time from cardiac arrest to ECMO flow to less than 60 min. We hypothesize that the initiation of Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (ECPR) by a Helicopter Emergency Medical Services System (HEMS) will reduce the low flow time and improve outcomes in refractory Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA) patients. The ON-SCENE study will use a non-randomised stepped wedge design to implement ECPR in patients with witnessed OHCA between the ages of 18-50 years old, with an initial presentation of shockable rhythm or pulseless electrical activity with a high suspicion of pulmonary embolism, lasting more than 20, but less than 45 min. Patients will be treated by the ambulance crew and HEMS with prehospital ECPR capabilities and will be compared with treatment by ambulance crew and HEMS without prehospital ECPR capabilities. The primary outcome measure will be survival at hospital discharge. The secondary outcome measure will be good neurological outcome defined as a cerebral performance categories scale score of 1 or 2 at 6 and 12 months. The ON-SCENE study focuses on initiating ECPR at the scene of OHCA using HEMS. The current in-hospital ECPR for OHCA obstacles encompassing low survival rates in refractory arrests, extended low-flow durations during transportation, and the critical time sensitivity of initiating ECPR, which could potentially be addressed through the implementation of the HEMS system.

We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study of all consecutive maternal out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that underwent PCD in the prehospital setting between May 1995 and December 2019. Registered data included patient demographics, operator background, advanced life support interventions, and timelines. Resuscitation performance was evaluated according to the 2015 European Resuscitation Guidelines. Seven patients underwent a prehospital PCD. Three mothers died on the scene, while four were transported to a hospital but died in the hospital. Seven neonates were born by PCD. One neonate died on the scene and six were transported to a hospital. Three neonates were eventually discharged from the hospital. Among the three surviving neonates, the periods from dispatch to start of PCD were 13, 14, and 21 min. There was a low incidence of maternal perimortem caesarean deliveries in The Netherlands. Only some neonates survived after PCD. It is recommended that PCD be performed as quickly as possible. Due to the delay, the mother has a far lower chance of survival than the neonate. In fatal cases, autopsy is strongly recommended.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between a range of pre- and peroperative factors and the extent of the inflammatory response, and to identify patients at risk of a greater inflammatory response following surgery. Patients 65 years and older undergoing a surgical procedure for a solid malignant tumour were prospectively included in an observational cohort study. Inflammatory markers were measured in plasma samples pre- and postoperatively: C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Preoperative and postoperative inflammatory factor assay results were compared, and associations between inflammatory markers and pre- and peroperative factors were explored using multivariate linear regression analysis. Between July 2010 and April 2014, plasma samples of 224 patients were obtained. Median age was 72 (65-89) years and 108 (48.2%) patients were male. The predominant diagnosis was carcinoma, 156 (69.6%). Anaesthesia duration was associated with increase in CRP, IL-1β and IL-6; intracavitary surgery with increase in IL-6; blood loss with decrease in CRP and IL-1β; total fluid volume administered with a decrease in IL-1β and disease stage was associated with increase in IL-6. The perioperative inflammatory response is related more to surgical characteristics rather than to preoperative factors (with the exception of disease stage). Elderly oncological patients undergoing longer lasting, intracavitary surgical procedures for more advanced disease stages develop the most intense inflammatory response.},

Clinical improvements rely on careful patient selection and accurate electrode placement. A common method for target localization is intraoperative microelectrode recording (MER). To facilitate MER, DBS surgery is traditionally performed under local or regional anesthesia. However, sedation or general anesthesia is sometimes needed for patients who are unable to tolerate the procedure fully awake because of severe motor symptoms, psychological distress, pain, or other forms of discomfort. The effect of anesthetic drugs on MER is controversial but likely depends on the type and dose of a particular anesthetic agent, underlying disease, and surgical target. In this narrative review, we provide an overview of the current literature on the anesthetic drugs most often used for sedation and anesthesia during DBS surgery, with a focus on their effects on MERs.},

Environmental factors are thought to play a central role in ICU sleep disruption, and so it is unclear why environmental interventions have shown limited improvements in objectively assessed sleep. In critically ill patients, it is difficult to isolate the influence of environmental factors from the varying contributions of non-environmental factors. We thus investigated the effects of the ICU environment on self-reported and objective sleep quality in 10 healthy nurses and doctors with no history of sleep pathology or current or past ICU employment participated. Their sleep at home, in an unfamiliar environment ('Control'), and in an active ICU ('ICU') was evaluated using polysomnography and the Richard-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire. Environmental sound, light and temperature exposure were measured continuously. We found that the control and ICU environment were noisier and warmer, but not darker than the home environment. Sleep on the ICU was perceived as qualitatively worse than in the home and control environment, despite relatively modest effects on polysomnography parameters compared with home sleep: mean total sleep times were reduced by 48 min, mean rapid eye movement sleep latency increased by 45 min, and the arousal index increased by 9. Arousability to an awake state by sound was similar. Our results suggest that the ICU environment plays a significant but partial role in objectively assessed ICU sleep impairment in patients, which may explain the limited improvement of objectively assessed sleep after environmental interventions.},

Physical activity during the preoperative period was assessed subjectively with the SQUASH questionnaire and objectively with the Sensewear activity monitor (accelerometer with physiological sensors). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess differences and Bland-Altman plots were used to assess the agreement between the measurement methods. Descriptive statistics were used for the dose-characteristics and Cohen's Kappa for the proportion of participants fulfilling the Dutch guideline for healthy physical activity (NNGB). Duration of vigorous activity was significantly higher when measured subjectively (120 min/week) than objectively (7 min/week, p = 0.001). Bland-Altman plots showed that differences between the methods increased with longer durations of moderate and total activity. The dose-characteristics of physical activity measured with the SQUASH varied widely among the participants and it consisted mainly of leisure time activities and light household activities. The percentage of participants complying with the NNGB guideline was 74% when measured subjectively and 90% when measured objectively (κ = 0.259, p = 0.089). Surprisingly, both measurement methods suggest that the majority of patients awaiting CABG surgery met the recommendations of the NNGB guideline. The agreement between the methods however decreased with higher physical activity levels. Despite its limitations, the study suggests the complementary value of a subjective and objective measurement of physical activity in free-living conditions among CABG patients.},

  abstract = {Clinical trials evaluating the safety and effectiveness of sedative medication use in critically ill adults undergoing mechanical ventilation differ considerably in their methodological approach. This heterogeneity impedes the ability to compare results across studies. The Sedation Consortium on Endpoints and Procedures for Treatment, Education, and Research Recommendations convened a meeting of multidisciplinary experts to develop recommendations for key methodologic elements of sedation trials in the ICU to help guide academic and industry clinical investigators. A 2-day in-person meeting was held in Washington, DC, on March 28-29, 2019, followed by a three-round, online modified Delphi consensus process. Thirty-six participants from academia, industry, and the Food and Drug Administration with expertise in relevant content areas, including two former ICU patients attended the in-person meeting, and the majority completed an online follow-up survey and participated in the modified Delphi process. The final recommendations were iteratively refined based on the survey results, participants' reactions to those results, summaries written by panel moderators, and a review of the meeting transcripts made from audio recordings. Fifteen recommendations were developed for study design and conduct, subject enrollment, outcomes, and measurement instruments. Consensus recommendations included obtaining input from ICU survivors and/or their families, ensuring adequate training for personnel using validated instruments for assessments of sedation, pain, and delirium in the ICU environment, and the need for methodological standardization. These recommendations are intended to assist researchers in the design, conduct, selection of endpoints, and reporting of clinical trials involving sedative medications and/or sedation protocols for adult ICU patients who require mechanical ventilation. These recommendations should be viewed as a starting point to improve clinical trials and help reduce methodological heterogeneity in future clinical trials.},

  abstract = {To summarize recent developments in the understanding of the pharmacology of the hypnotic and opioid drugs, with relevance to target-controlled infusions and newer pharmacokinetic models. General-purpose models have been developed for propofol, remifentanil, and dexmedetomidine, suitable for use in a wide variety of patients, but still not universally applicable. A validation study of the predictive performance of the Eleveld propofol model showed reasonable performance in children, healthy adults, and obese adults but poorer performance in elderly patients. Observational studies show that complications during total intravenous anesthesia often arise from omission of basic safety checks and inadequate knowledge, rather than model misspecification. Specifically, there is a lack of understanding of the influence of the clinical situation on the pharmacodynamics of hypnotic drugs. Artificial intelligence is likely to produce useful drug infusion rate advisory systems, or even closed-loop control systems that could potentially provide better patient-individualized titration of anesthetic drugs. Further efforts to develop new models are unlikely to be clinically beneficial. Efforts should rather be made to ensure better education and a better appreciation of variability in pharmacodynamics and the need for better ways of tailoring drug doses to individual patient needs.},

Sedation is commonly required during electrode implantation to attenuate anxiety, pain, and severe tics. Anesthetic agents potentially impair the quality of microelectrode recordings (MER). Little is known about the effect of these anesthetics on MER in patients with TS. We describe our experience with different sedative regimens on MER and tic severity in patients with TS. The clinical records of all TS patients who underwent DBS surgery between 2010 and 2018 were reviewed. Demographic data, stimulation targets, anesthetic agents, perioperative complications, and MER from each hemisphere were collected and analyzed. Single-unit activity was identified by filtering spiking activity from broadband MER data and principal component analysis with K-means clustering. Vocal and motor tics which caused artifacts in the MER data were manually selected using visual and auditory inspection. Six patients underwent bilateral DBS electrode implantation. In all patients, the target was the anterior internal globus pallidus. Patient comfort and hemodynamic and respiratory stability were maintained with conscious sedation with one or more of the following anesthetic drugs: propofol, midazolam, remifentanil, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine. Good quality MER and clinical testing were obtained in 9 hemispheres of 6 patients. In 3 patients, MER quality was poor on one side. Cautiously applied sedative drugs can provide patient comfort, hemodynamic and respiratory stability, and suppress severe tics, with minimal interference with MER.},

DBS surgery is commonly performed under local anesthesia (LA) to obtain reliable microelectrode recordings. However, procedural sedation and/or analgesia (PSA) is often desirable to improve patient comfort. The impact of PSA in addition to LA on outcome is largely unknown. Therefore, we performed an observational study to assess the effect of PSA compared to LA alone during STN DBS surgery on outcome in PD patients. Seventy PD patients (22 under LA, 48 under LA + PSA) scheduled for STN DBS implantation were included. Dexmedetomidine, clonidine or remifentanil were used for PSA. The primary outcome was the change in Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score III (MDS-UPDRS III) and levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) between baseline, one month before surgery, and twelve months postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures were motor function during activities of daily living (MDS-UPDRS II), cognitive alterations and surgical adverse events. Postoperative assessment was conducted in "on" stimulation and "on" medication conditions. At twelve months follow-up, UPDRS III and UPDRS II scores in "on" medication conditions were similar between the LA and PSA groups. The two groups showed a similar LEDD reduction and an equivalent decline in executive function measured by the Stroop Color-Word Test, Trail Making Test-B, and verbal fluency. The incidence of perioperative and postoperative adverse events was similar between groups. This study demonstrates that PSA during STN DBS implantation surgery in PD patients was not associated with differences in motor and non-motor outcome after twelve months compared with LA only.},

  abstract = {Biomarkers for neurodegenerative dementias offer interesting prospects regarding diagnosis and disease monitoring. Monoamines such as dopamine, (nor)adrenaline, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine or 5-HT), and their respective metabolites homovanillic acid (HVA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), were shown to be altered in dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Biomarker research is hampered by potential confounds including the influence of time of day and volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected. Therefore, the possibility of a circadian rhythm in CSF and plasma, and the presence of a rostrocaudal concentration gradient (RCG) in CSF for aforementioned monoamines/metabolites, were investigated. Circadian rhythmicity was assessed using reversed-phase ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (RP-UHPLC-ECD) to measure monoamine/metabolite concentrations in 271 paired CSF and plasma samples, successively collected over a period of 30 h and derived from eight healthy subjects. Plasma samples were also analyzed for melatonin, serving as positive control analyte, using ELISA. The RCG examination entailed RP-UHPLC-ECD analyses on five consecutive CSF samples derived from 10 patients with AD and 10 non-AD/control subjects. Besides a diurnal rhythm for melatonin, we found a similar rhythmicity for plasma HVA, with acrophases occurring between 02:00 and 06:00 h, in four out of seven subjects. Three and two subjects showed a circadian rhythm for CSF HVA and 5-HIAA, respectively. No rhythmicity was observed in any other compound. We found that only CSF MHPG, HVA and 5-HIAA levels differed across CSF fractions, and that these changes in 5-HIAA levels varied in the AD versus non-AD/control group. Positive correlations between CSF volume and HVA and 5-HIAA levels, indicative of a RCG, were also observed. Such a RCG could not be detected for the other monoamines/metabolites. Our results stress the importance of standardizing sampling procedures of biological fluids with respect to time of day, volume and number of samples.},

We studied whether elderly patients benefit to the same extent compared with younger patients and at long-term follow up as compared with the general population. Between 2001 and 2010, data from all patients presented to our hospital after OHCA were recorded. Elderly patients (⩾75 years) were compared with younger patients. Neurological outcome was classified as cerebral performance category (CPC) at hospital discharge and long-term survival was compared with younger patients and predicted survival rates of the general population. Of the 810 patients admitted after OHCA, a total of 551 patients (68%) achieved return of spontaneous circulation, including 125 (23%) elderly patients with a mean age of 81 ± 5 years. In-hospital survival was lower in elderly patients compared with younger patients with rates of 33% versus 57% ( p < 0.001). A CPC of 1 was present in 73% of the elderly patients versus 86% of the younger patients ( p = 0.031). In 7.3% of the elderly patients, a CPC >2 was observed versus 2.5% of their younger counterparts ( p = 0.103). Elderly patients had a median survival of 6.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-7.9] years compared with 7.7 (95% CI 7.5-7.9) years of the general population ( p = 0.019). The survival rate after OHCA in elderly patients is approximately half that of younger patients. Elderly patients who survive to discharge frequently have favorable neurological outcomes and a long-term survival that approximates that of the general population.},

Blood samples were collected from a catheter in a cephalic vein at 3-7 time points between 1 and 100 min following the propofol bolus and/or infusion in five chimpanzees, or TCI in six chimpanzees. Cp was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. The Marsh, Schnider and Eleveld human pharmacokinetic models were used to predict Cp for each case and we examined the predictive performances of these models using the Varvel criteria Median PE and Median APE. Median PE and Median APE for Marsh, Schnider and Eleveld models were within or close to the acceptable range. A human TCI pump was successfully maintained propofol Cp during general anesthesia in six chimpanzees. Human propofol pharmacokinetic models and TCI pumps can be applied in chimpanzees.},

  abstract = {Tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity are incapacitating motor symptoms that can be suppressed with stereotactic neurosurgical treatment like deep brain stimulation (DBS) and ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy, pallidotomy). Traditionally, clinicians rely on clinical rating scales for intraoperative evaluation of these motor symptoms during awake stereotactic neurosurgery. However, these clinical scales have a relatively high inter-rater variability and rely on experienced raters. Therefore, objective registration (e.g., using movement sensors) is a reasonable extension for intraoperative assessment of tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. The main goal of this scoping review is to provide an overview of electronic motor measurements during awake stereotactic neurosurgery. The protocol was based on the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews. After a systematic database search (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science), articles were screened for relevance. Hundred-and-three articles were subject to detailed screening. Key clinical and technical information was extracted. The inclusion criteria encompassed use of electronic motor measurements during stereotactic neurosurgery performed under local anesthesia. Twenty-three articles were included. These studies had various objectives, including correlating sensor-based outcome measures to clinical scores, identifying optimal DBS electrode positions, and translating clinical assessments to objective assessments. The studies were highly heterogeneous in device choice, sensor location, measurement protocol, design, outcome measures, and data analysis. This review shows that intraoperative quantification of motor symptoms is still limited by variable signal analysis techniques and lacking standardized measurement protocols. However, electronic motor measurements can complement visual evaluations and provide objective confirmation of correct placement of the DBS electrode and/or lesioning. On the long term, this might benefit patient outcomes and provide reliable outcome measures in scientific research.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of IONM and the cortical excitability in these patients. Fifteen patients with DMD and scoliosis and 15 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) underwent scoliosis correction surgery with the use of IONM. IONM consisted of transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potential (Tc-MEP) and somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring. The highest Tc-MEP amplitudes were collected to test the feasibility. Preoperative compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-MEPs were recorded to test the cortical excitability. SSEPs were scored as elicitable or not elicitable. Tc-MEP amplitudes were significantly lower in the DMD group for both the gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles. However, the abductor hallucis muscle had similar amplitudes in both the DMD as the AIS group. TMS/CMAP and Tc-MEP/CMAP ratios were similar in the DMD and AIS group (P = 0.126 and P = 0.792 respectively). Tc-MEP and SSEP monitoring is feasible, particularly when Tc-MEPs are recorded from the abductor hallucis muscle in patients with DMD. Similar TMS/CMAP and Tc-MEP/CMAP ratios show that there were no differences observed in cortical excitability between the groups. IONM seems a feasible and valuable neurophysiological tool to signal possible surgically induced damage to the spinal cord during scoliosis correction surgery in patients with DMD.},

Changes in arterial blood pressure (BP) during procedural sedation are not well described. Individual patient data from five trials of propofol sedation for colonoscopy and a clinical database were pooled and explored with logistic and linear regression. A literature search and focused meta-analysis compared the incidence of hypotension with propofol and alternative forms of procedural sedation. Hypotensive episodes were characterised by the original authors' definitions (typically systolic BP <90 mm Hg). In pooled individual patient data (n=939), 36% of procedures were associated with episodes of hypotension. Longer periods of propofol sedation and larger propofol doses were associated with longer-lasting and more-profound hypotension. Amongst 380 patients for whom individual BP measurements were available, 107 (28%) experienced systolic BP <90 mm Hg for >5 min, and in 89 (23%) the episodes exceeded 10 min. Meta-analysis of 18 RCTs identified an increased risk ratio for the development of hypotension in procedures where propofol was used compared with the use of etomidate (two studies; n=260; risk ratio [RR] 2.0 [95% confidence interval: 1.37-2.92]; P=0.0003), remimazolam (one study; n=384; RR 2.15 [1.61-2.87]; P=0.0001), midazolam (14 studies; n=2218; RR 1.46 [1.18-1.79]; P=0.0004), or all benzodiazepines (15 studies; n=2602; 1.67 [1.41-1.98]; P<0.00001). Hypotension was less likely with propofol than with dexmedetomidine (one study; n=60; RR 0.24 [0.09-0.62]; P=0.003). Hypotension is common during propofol sedation for colonoscopy and of a magnitude and duration associated with harm in surgical patients.},

Biomarker research using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a promising way to illuminate the neurobiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. CSF biomarker studies performed so far generally included patients with neurodegenerative diseases without an adequate control group. The Anaesthetic Biobank of Cerebrospinal fluid (ABC) was established to address this. The aims are to (I) provide healthy-control reference values for CSF-based biomarkers, and (II) to investigate associations between CSF-based candidate biomarkers and neuropsychiatric symptoms. In this cross-sectional study, we collect and store CSF and blood from adult patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia for elective surgery. Blood (20.5 mL) is collected during intravenous cannulation and CSF (10 mL) is aspirated prior to intrathecal local anaesthetic injection. A portion of the blood and CSF is sent for routine laboratory analyses, the remaining material is stored at -80 °C. Relevant clinical, surgical and anaesthetic data are registered. A neurological examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) are performed pre-operatively and a subset of patients fill in questionnaires on somatic and mental health (depression, anxiety and stress). Four-hundred-fifty patients (58% male; median age: 56 years) have been enrolled in the ABC. The planned spinal anaesthetic procedure was not attempted for various reasons in eleven patients, in fourteen patients the spinal puncture failed and in twelve patients CSF aspiration was unsuccessful. A mean of 9.3 mL CSF was obtained in the remaining 413 of patients. Most patients had a minor medical history and 60% scored in the normal range on the MoCA (median score: 26). The ABC is an ongoing biobanking project that can contribute to CSF-based biomarker research. The large sample size with constant sampling methods and extensive patient phenotyping provide excellent conditions for future neuroscientific research.},

This multicenter cohort study is an analysis of prospectively collected observational data from the Brain Injury: Prehospital Registry of Outcome, Treatments and Epidemiology of Cerebral Trauma (BRAIN-PROTECT) study in the Netherlands. Patients treated for suspected severe TBI by the Dutch Helicopter Emergency Medical Services between February 2012 and December 2017 were included.

The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included mortality at 1 year, functional neurological recovery at discharge (measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale), and length of hospital stay. Data were also collected on demographic factors, preinjury medical condition, injury characteristics, operational characteristics, and prehospital vital parameters. A total of 1827 patients were analyzed, of whom 1283 (70%) were male individuals and the median (interquartile range) age was 45 (23-65) years. In the unadjusted analysis, higher 30-day mortality was observed in patients who received prehospital tranexamic acid (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.16-1.55; P < .001), compared with patients who did not receive prehospital tranexamic acid. After adjustment for confounders, no association between prehospital administration of tranexamic acid and mortality was found across the entire cohort of patients. However, a substantial increase in the odds of 30-day mortality persisted in patients with severe isolated TBI who received prehospital tranexamic acid (OR, 4.49; 95% CI, 1.57-12.87; P = .005) and after multiple imputations (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.22-3.45; P = .007). This study found that prehospital tranexamic acid administration was associated with increased mortality in patients with isolated severe TBI, suggesting the judicious use of the drug when no evidence for extracranial hemorrhage is present.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to explore the influence of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on both postoperative cognitive dysfunction and quality of life (QoL) and the association between the two patient-related outcomes. In a prospective, observational cohort study, patients with elective, isolated CABG were included. Cognitive function was assessed using the Cogstate computerised cognitive test battery preoperatively, 3 days and 6 months after surgery. QoL was measured preoperatively and at 6 months using the RAND-36 questionnaire including the Physical Component Score (PCS) and the Mental Component Score (MCS). Regression analysis, with adjustment for confounders, was used to evaluate the association between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and QoL. A total of 142 patients were included in the study. Evidence of persistent cognitive dysfunction was observed in 33% of patients after 6 months. At 6 months, the PCS had improved in 59% and decreased in 21% of patients, and the MCS increased in 49% and decreased in 29%. Postoperative cognitive changes were not associated with QoL scores. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction and decreased QoL are common 6 months after surgery, although cognitive function and QoL were found to have improved in many patients at 6 months of follow-up. Impaired cognitive function is not associated with impaired QoL at 6 months. NCT03774342.},

This dual-centre, prospective, observational study assesses whether the availability of SmartPilot® View alters the behaviour of anaesthetic drug titration of anaesthetists and improves the Anaesthesia Quality Score (AQS; percentage of time spent with MAP 60-80 mm Hg and Bispectral Index [BIS] 40-60 [blinded]). We recruited 493 patients scheduled for elective surgery in two university centres. A control group (CONTROL; n=170) was enrolled to observe drug titration in current practice. Thereafter, an intervention group was enrolled, for which SmartPilot® View was made available to optimise drug titration (SPV; n=188). The AQS, haemodynamic and hypnotic effects, recovery times, pain scores, and other parameters were compared between groups. There were 358 patients eligible for analysis. Anaesthesia quality score was similar between CONTROL and SPV (median AQS [Q1-Q3]) 25.3% [7.4-41.5%] and 22.2% [8.0-44.4%], respectively; P=0.898). Compared with CONTROL, SPV patients had less severe hypotension and hypertension, less BIS <40, faster tracheal extubation, and lower early postoperative pain scores. Adding SmartPilot® View information did not affect average drug titration behaviour. However, small improvements in control of MAP and BIS and early recovery suggest improved titration for some patients without increasing the risk of overdosing or underdosing. NCT01467167.},

  abstract = {Severe traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among young people around the world. Prehospital care focuses on the prevention and treatment of secondary brain injury and commonly includes tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia. The choice of induction agent in this setting is controversial. This study therefore investigated the association between the chosen induction medication etomidate versus S(+)-ketamine and the 30-day mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury who received prehospital airway management in the Netherlands. This study is a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected observational data of the Brain Injury: Prehospital Registry of Outcomes, Treatments and Epidemiology of Cerebral Trauma (BRAIN-PROTECT) cohort study. Patients with suspected severe traumatic brain injury who were transported to a participating trauma center and who received etomidate or S(+)-ketamine for prehospital induction of anesthesia for advanced airway management were included. Statistical analyses were performed with multivariable logistic regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis. In total, 1,457 patients were eligible for analysis. No significant association between the administered induction medication and 30-day mortality was observed in unadjusted analyses (32.9% mortality for etomidate versus 33.8% mortality for S(+)-ketamine; P = 0.716; odds ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.32; P = 0.711), as well as after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.73; P = 0.765; and risk difference 0.017; 95% CI, -0.051 to 0.084; P = 0.686). Likewise, in planned subgroup analyses for patients with confirmed traumatic brain injury and patients with isolated traumatic brain injury, no significant differences were found. Consistent results were found after multiple imputations of missing data. The analysis found no evidence for an association between the use of etomidate or S(+)-ketamine as an anesthetic agent for intubation in patients with traumatic brain injury and mortality after 30 days in the prehospital setting, suggesting that the choice of induction agent may not influence the patient mortality rate in this population.},

It causes an arousable state of sedation, which is beneficial during neurosurgical procedures that require the patient to cooperate with neurological tests (i.e. tumor surgery or implantation of deep brain stimulators). During procedures where monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials and/or motor evoked potentials is required, dexmedetomidine can be used as an adjunct to general anesthesia with GABAergic drugs to decrease the dose of the latter when these drugs impair the monitoring signals. The use of dexmedetomidine has also been associated with neuroprotective effects and a decreased incidence of delirium, but studies confirming these effects in the peri-operative (neuro-)surgical setting are lacking. Although dexmedetomidine does not cause respiratory depression, its hemodynamic effects are complex and careful patient selection, choice of dose, and monitoring must be performed.},

The BRAIN-PROTECT study is a prospective observational study on prehospital management of patients with severe TBI in the Netherlands. The study population comprised all consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of TBI and a prehospital GCS score ≤ 8, who were managed by one of the 4 Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS). Patients were followed-up in 9 trauma centers until 1 year after injury. Planned sub-analyses were performed for patients with "confirmed" and "isolated" TBI. Data from 2,589 patients, of whom 2,117 (81.8%) were transferred to a participating trauma center, were analyzed. The incidence rate of prehospitally suspected and confirmed severe TBI were 3.2 (95% CI: 3.1;3.4) and 2.7 (95% CI: 2.5;2.8) per 100,000 inhabitants per year, respectively. Median patient age was 46 years, 58.4% were involved in traffic crashes, of which 37.4% were bicycle related. 47.6% presented with an initial GCS of 3. The median time from HEMS dispatch to hospital arrival was 54 minutes. The overall 30-day mortality was 39.0% (95% CI: 36.8;41.2).

Predictive performance was assessed using the Varvel criteria. For PK, the Eleveld model showed a bias < ±20% in children, adults, and obese adults, but a greater bias (-27%) in older subjects. Precision was <30% in all groups. For PD, the bias and wobble were <5 BIS units and the precision was close to 10 BIS units in all groups. Anaesthetists were able to achieve intraoperative BIS values of 40-60 using effect-site target concentrations about 85-140% of the age-adjusted Ce The Eleveld propofol PK-PD model showed predictive precision <30% for arterial plasma concentrations and BIS predictions with a low (population) bias when used in TCI in clinical anaesthesia practice.},

  abstract = {For high-risk spinal surgeries, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) is used to detect and prevent intraoperative neurological injury. The motor tracts are monitored by recording and analyzing muscle transcranial electrical stimulation motor evoked potentials (mTc-MEPs). A mTc-MEP amplitude decrease of 50-80% is the most common warning criterion for possible neurological injury. However, these warning criteria often result in false positive warnings. False positives may be caused by inadequate depth of anesthesia and blood pressure on mTc-MEP amplitudes. The aim of this paper is to validate the study protocol in which the goal is to investigate the effects of depth of anesthesia (part 1) and blood pressure (part 2) on mTc-MEPs. Per part, 25 patients will be included. In order to investigate the effects of depth of anesthesia, a processed electroencephalogram (pEEG) monitor will be used. At pEEG values of 30, 40 and 50, mTc-MEP measurements will be performed. To examine the effect of blood pressure on mTc-MEPs the mean arterial pressure will be elevated from 60 to 100 mmHg during which mTc-MEP measurements will be performed. We hypothesize that by understanding the effects of depth of anesthesia and blood pressure on mTc-MEPs, the mTc-MEP monitoring can be interpreted more reliably. This may contribute to fewer false positive warnings. By performing this study after induction and prior to incision, this protocol provides a unique opportunity to study the effects of depths of anesthesia and blood pressure on mTc-MEPs alone with as little confounders as possible.

Systemic inflammation resulting in neuroinflammation is considered important in the pathogenesis of POCD. The aim of this study was to explore the association between the early surgery-induced inflammatory response and POCD within 3 months after surgery in older cancer patients. Patients ≥65 years in need of surgery for a solid tumor were included in a prospective cohort study. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured perioperatively. Cognitive performance was assessed preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. POCD was defined as a decline in cognitive test scores of ≥25% on ≥2 of five tests within the different cognitive domains of memory, executive functioning, and information processing speed. Logistic regression analysis was performed. POCD was observed in 44 (17.7%) of 248 included patients. Age >75, preoperative Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≤26 and major surgery were independent significant predictors for POCD. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, no significant associations were shown between the early surgery-induced inflammatory response and either POCD or decline within the different cognitive domains. This study shows that one out of six older patients with cancer developed POCD within 3 months after surgery. The early surgery-induced inflammatory response was neither associated with POCD, nor with decline in the separate cognitive domains. Further research is necessary for better understanding of the complex etiology of POCD.},

There is growing interest in exercise programs as part of surgical 'prehabilitation'. We therefore studied preoperative physical activity levels of patients undergoing elective Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) surgery, and performed an exploratory analysis of the influence of physical activity on postoperative outcome. The Short Questionnaire to Assess Health (SQUASH) was used to assess physical activity among 100 patients, of mean (SD) age 65.4 (7.6) years. Additionally, handgrip strength was measured, and the get-up-and-go test was conducted. Anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed, and a computerised cognitive test battery was used to assess cognitive performance preoperatively, and three months after surgery. Preoperatively, 76% of patients met the recommended national guidelines for physical activity. The incidence of pre-existing medical conditions, and other pre-operative patient features were similar in active and inactive patients. Preoperative physical activity was significantly inversely related to the logistic EuroSCORE. The level of physical activity was also significantly inversely related with preoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) and peak postoperative CRP, but physical activity did not appear to be associated with any adverse postoperative outcomes or extended length of hospital stay. The incidence of postoperative neurocognitive disorder (PNCD) at 3 months postoperatively was 26%. Cognitive performance was not related with physical activity levels. In summary, this was the first study to assess activity levels of cardiac surgical patients with the SQUASH questionnaire. The majority of patients were physically active. Although physical activity was associated with lower levels of inflammation in this pilot study, it was not associated with an improved clinical or cognitive postoperative outcome.},

We aimed to investigate the association of anesthetic and physiological parameters with mTc-MEPs. Intraoperative mTc-MEP amplitudes, mTc-MEP area under the curves (AUC), and anesthetic and physiological measurements were collected retrospectively from the records of 108 consecutive patients undergoing elective spinal surgery. Pharmacological parameters of interest included propofol and opioid concentration, ketamine and noradrenaline infusion rates. Physiological parameters recorded included mean arterial pressure (MAP), bispectral index (BIS), heart rate, hemoglobin O 2 saturation, temperature, and Et co2 . A forward selection procedure was performed using multivariable mixed model analysis. Data from 75 (69.4%) patients were included. MAP and BIS were significantly associated with mTc-MEP amplitude ( P < .001). mTc-MEP amplitudes increased by 6.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.7%-10.4%) per 10 mm Hg increase in MAP and by 2.79% (CI, 2.26%-3.32%) for every unit increase in BIS. MAP ( P < .001), BIS ( P < .001), heart rate ( P = .01), and temperature ( P = .02) were significantly associated with mTc-MEP AUC. The AUC increased by 7.5% (CI, 3.3%-11.7%) per 10 mm Hg increase of MAP, by 2.98% (CI, 2.41%-3.54%) per unit increase in BIS, and by 0.68% (CI, 0.13%-1.23%) per beat per minute increase in heart rate. mTc-MEP AUC decreased by 21.4% (CI, -38.11% to -3.98%) per degree increase in temperature. MAP, BIS, heart rate, and temperature were significantly associated with mTc-MEP amplitude and/or AUC. Maintenance of BIS and MAP at the high normal values may attenuate anesthetic effects on mTc-MEPs.},

  abstract = {Transcranial electrical stimulation muscle-recorded motor evoked potentials (Tc-mMEPs) are used to monitor the spinal cord motor tracts during spinal surgery. There is considerable intra- and interindividual variability in the signals recorded, causing a high incidence of false positive warnings. Inadequate blood pressure is commonly blamed for false positive warnings and is usually managed with fluid and vasopressor therapy. The aim of the study was to systematically investigate the effects of norepinephrine and ephedrine-induced arterial blood pressure elevation on Tc-mMEPs. Twenty-five patients undergoing spinal surgery were included in this prospective observational study. After anesthetic induction and positioning, but before incision, a norepinephrine infusion was used to increase the mean arterial pressure (MAP) from approximately 60 to 100 mm Hg. Tc-mMEP amplitudes and area under the curves (AUC) were recorded from the abductor hallucis (AH), tibialis anterior (TA), and hand muscles every 2 minutes. Voltage thresholds of the AH, TA, and hand muscles were determined at MAP values of 60, 80, and 100 mm Hg. The primary objective was to determine the effects of increasing the MAP with a vasopressor infusion on Tc-mMEP amplitude, AUC, and threshold. For the secondary objective, the outcomes were adjusted for depth of anesthesia and propofol concentrations. Post hoc analyses included adjusting for confounders, noradrenaline infusion rate, and use of ephedrine, investigating the effects of cardiac index on Tc-mMEP characteristics, investigating the influence of increasing MAP on the excitability of the peripheral nervous system, and investigating the effects of MAP on BIS. In the AH, TA, and hand muscles, Tc-mMEP amplitudes and AUC were significantly associated with MAP (P < .02). A 10 mm Hg increase of the MAP was associated with a 11.0% to 17.7% increase in the amplitude and a 10.5% to 16.8% increase in the AUC. When adjusting for BIS, propofol concentrations, and use of ephedrine, MAP remained only significantly associated with the Tc-mMEP amplitude (P = .002) and AUC (P = .003) of the AH muscles. The influence of cardiac index on Tc-mMEP amplitude and AUC provided similar results when compared to the influence of MAP on Tc-mMEP amplitude and AUC. No influence of increasing MAP on the excitability of the peripheral nervous system was found. Increasing MAP significantly increased BIS values, even when corrected for propofol concentrations. Elevation of MAP is associated with significantly higher Tc-mMEP amplitudes, AUCs, and lower voltage threshold. When corrected for BIS, propofol concentration, and use of ephedrine, the associations between increasing MAP and Tc-mMEP characteristics were largely attenuated. BIS values significantly increased by increasing MAP, when corrected for propofol concentration. Thereby, our results imply that increasing MAP increases the cortical excitability.},

  abstract = {During hyperglycaemia, some glucose bypasses glycolysis and is metabolised via the potentially neurotoxic polyol pathway, in which glucose is metabolised to sorbitol and fructose. Increased polyol concentrations have been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neurological patients with and without diabetes mellitus. However, polyol levels in patients without evident neurological abnormalities have not been investigated so far. The aim of this study was to determine CSF polyol concentrations in patients without major neurological disease with normal or elevated CSF glucose concentrations. This observational cohort study used CSF and plasma analyses, as well as clinical data, from 30 participants of the Anaesthetic Biobank of Cerebrospinal Fluid study. Biomaterial was collected from adult patients scheduled for elective surgery under spinal anaesthesia. CSF polyol concentrations were measured by GC/flame ionisation detector in ten patients with normal CSF glucose levels (group 1), ten patients with elevated CSF glucose levels (group 2) and ten patients with elevated CSF glucose levels and type 2 diabetes (group 3). We compared the concentrations of plasma glucose, CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose, and CSF polyol/glucose ratios between the three groups, and determined the correlation between plasma glucose levels and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose levels. Groups 2 and 3 had significantly higher CSF fructose levels compared with group 1 (p=0.036 and p<0.001, respectively). Group 3 showed significant differences compared with groups 1 and 2 for CSF sorbitol (p<0.001 and 0.036, respectively). Moreover, patients with diabetes had a significantly higher CSF sorbitol/glucose ratio compared with patients without diabetes. There was a strong positive correlation between plasma glucose and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose. Finally, age, sex, CSF/plasma albumin ratio and preoperative cognitive function scores were significantly correlated with plasma glucose and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose levels. Hyperglycaemia causes a proportional increase in polyol concentrations in CSF of patients without major neurological disease. Furthermore, this study provides the first indication of upregulation of the cerebral polyol pathway in patients with diabetes without evident neurological abnormalities.},

The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between the intraoperative MLE and the clinical effect of DBS. Thirty Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III (MDS-UPDRS III) scores during bilateral STN-DBS implantation were included in this retrospective study. MDS-UPDRS III subscores (resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia) of the contralateral upper extremity were used. During surgery, these subscores were assessed directly before and after insertion of the electrode. Also, these subscores were determined in the outpatient clinic after 11 weeks on average (on-stimulation). All assessments were performed in an off-medication state (at least 12 hours of medication washout). Postinsertion MDS-UPDRS motor scores decreased significantly compared to preinsertion scores (p < 0.001 for both hemispheres). The MLE showed a positive correlation with the clinical effect of DBS in both hemispheres (rho = 0.68 for the primarily treated hemisphere, p < 0.001, and rho = 0.59 for the secondarily treated hemisphere, p < 0.01). The MLE has a clinically relevant correlation with the effect of DBS in PD patients. These results suggest that the MLE can be relied upon as evidence of a clinically effective DBS electrode placement.},

The effect of these agents on MER are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of commonly used PSA agents, dexmedetomidine, clonidine and remifentanil and patient characteristics on MER during DBS surgery. Data from 78 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who underwent STN-DBS surgery were retrospectively reviewed. The procedures were performed under local anesthesia or under PSA with dexmedetomidine, clonidine or remifentanil. In total, 4082 sites with multi-unit activity (MUA) and 588 with single units were acquired. Single unit firing rates and coefficient of variation (CV), and MUA total power were compared between patient groups. We observed a significant reduction in MUA, an increase of the CV and a trend for reduced firing rate by dexmedetomidine. The effect of dexmedetomidine was dose-dependent for all measures. Remifentanil had no effect on the firing rate but was associated with a significant increase in CV and a decrease in MUA. Clonidine showed no significant effect on firing rate, CV or MUA. In addition to anesthetic effects, MUA and CV were also influenced by patient-dependent variables. Our results showed that PSA influenced neuronal properties in the STN and the dexmedetomidine (DEX) effect was dose-dependent. In addition, patient-dependent characteristics also influenced MER.},

Dental treatment is often impossible in geriatric MND patients with CRB. Intranasal midazolam may provide a non-invasive sedation method, but there is currently no information on its use in geriatric patients. In this observational study, we included geriatric patients with severe MND and CRB needing urgent dental treatment. Each patient received 5 mg midazolam intranasally. Agitation/sedation levels, heart rate, respiration rate and oxygen saturation were recorded at 5-minute intervals. Thirty two patients were included. Mean age was 84 (±7) years. Mean (SD) time to treatment start was 13 (±5) minutes, and mean time to maximum sedation 17 (±11) minutes. Sedation was sufficient to enable dental treatment to be completed in 31 (97%) patients. Anxiolysis/light sedation occurred in 16 (50%) patients, and moderate to deep sedation occurred in 16 (50%) patients. No patients suffered from apnoea, although 3 patients required a chin-lift manoeuvre. Hypoxaemia occurred in 1 of these patients and in 2 other patients without airway obstruction. All patients recovered uneventfully. In a regression model, age, weight and other sedative medication use were found not to be associated with maximum sedation depth. Of 5 mg intranasal midazolam facilitates treatment of geriatric patients with MND in the comfort of their own environment. More information is needed to guide titration to balance the desired sedation level and patient safety.},

  abstract = {Potential biomarkers for neuropsychiatric disorders are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) monoamines and their corresponding precursors and metabolites. During CSF sampling, CSF flows towards the lumbar sampling site from more cranial regions. To compare the results of studies in which different CSF volumes were acquired, it is important to know if ventricular-lumbar concentration gradients exist. This has only been addressed for a few biogenic amines, and almost exclusively in neurologically unwell patients due to the burden of a lumbar puncture (necessary to obtain CSF). The aim of our study was to determine if concentration gradients exist for routinely measured CSF constituents and biogenic amines in neurologically healthy patients. We applied a novel ultrasensitive liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of multiple monoamines, precursors and metabolites in CSF and plasma. CSF and blood samples were collected from twenty neurologically healthy patients undergoing spinal anaesthesia. Ten mL of lumbar CSF was collected in five consecutive two mL fractions. We determined leucocyte and erythrocyte counts, glucose, albumin and protein concentrations and quantified monoamines, precursors and metabolites on each of the fractions using LC-MS/MS. In twenty patients (60% male; median age: 46 years), dopamine, DOPAC, 3-MT, HVA, noradrenaline, normetanephrine and 5-HIAA concentrations increased from the first to the last CSF fraction (all p < 0.001). CSF adrenaline concentrations were below the detection limit, whereas serotonin measurements were regarded as unreliable. Albumin and total protein levels decreased significantly across CSF fractions. A ventricular-lumbar CSF concentration gradient existed for most of the investigated analytes. This is a novel finding for dopamine, noradrenaline, 3-MT and normetanephrine. These results contribute to the understanding of the neurobiology and underline the importance of standardized procedures for CSF handling to allow comparisons between studies.},

Patients 65 years and older undergoing surgery for removal of a solid malignant tumour were included in an observational cohort study. All complications occurring up to 30 days postoperatively were documented prospectively. Inflammatory markers were measured in plasma samples pre- and postoperatively: C-reactive protein (CRP), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Associations between inflammatory markers and postoperative complications were explored using logistic regression analysis. Between July 2010 and April 2014, plasma samples of 224 patients were collected. Median age was 72 (65-89) years and 116 (51.8%) patients were female. Approximately half of the patients developed postoperative complications (49.6%) of whom 62 patients (55.9%) developed >1 complication. An independent prognostic effect was observed for the inflammatory biomarkers IL-6 and IL-10 for the occurrence of postoperative complications. The perioperative inflammatory response is associated with complications, independently from patient and surgical factors which are also associated with outcome. Research is warranted towards further exploration of the perioperative inflammatory response with the aim to improve perioperative care and outcome, and might help to improve surgical planning and decision making for older patients with cancer.},

Observations from 350 individuals (220 men, 130 women) were analyzed, comprising 6,312 ABP-700 concentrations, 5,658 ABP-700 metabolite (CPM-acid) concentrations, 25,745 filtered BIS values, and 6,249 MOAA/S scores, and a recirculatory model developed. Various subject covariates and pretreatment with an opioid or a benzodiazepine were explored as covariates. Relationships between BIS and MOAA/S models and involuntary muscle movements were examined. The final model shows that the pharmacokinetics of ABP-700 are characterized by small compartmental volumes and rapid clearance. The BIS model incorporates an effect-site for BIS suppression and a secondary excitatory/disinhibitory effect-site associated with a risk of involuntary muscle movements. The secondary effect-site has a threshold that decreases with age. The MOAA/S model did not show excitatory effects. The GABAA receptor agonist ABP-700 shows the expected suppressive effects for BIS and MOAA/S, but also disinhibitory effects for BIS associated with involuntary muscle movements and reduced by pretreatment. Our model provides information about involuntary muscle movements that may be useful to improve depth of anesthesia monitoring for GABAA receptor agonists.},

In this prospective cohort study, patients 65 years and older in need for oncologic surgery were included. Inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), IL-6, IL10 and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured in plasma samples pre- and post-operatively. Delirium Observation Screening Scale (DOS) was used as screening instrument for POD in the first week after surgery. In case of positive screening, diagnosis of POD was assessed by a clinician. Between 2010 and 2016, plasma samples of 311 patients with median age of 72 years (range 65-89) were collected. A total of 38 (12%) patients developed POD in the first week after surgery. The perioperative increase in plasma levels of IL-10 and NGAL were associated with POD in multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR 1.33 [1.09-1.63] P = 0.005 and OR 1.30 [1.03-1.64], P = 0.026, respectively). The biomarkers CRP, IL-1β and IL-6 were not significantly associated with POD. Increased surgery-evoked inflammatory responses of IL-10 and NGAL are associated with the development of POD in older oncological patients. The outcomes of this study contribute to understanding the aetiology of neuroinflammation and the development of POD.},

While several studies have investigated the ability of the underlying pharmacokinetic-dynamic models to predict plasma concentrations, there are no data on their performance in predicting drug concentrations in the human brain. We assessed the predictive performance of the Marsh propofol model and Minto remifentanil model for plasma and brain tissue concentrations. Plasma samples were obtained during neurosurgery from 38 patients, and brain tissue samples from nine patients. Propofol and remifentanil concentrations were measured using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Data were analysed from the nine patients in whom both plasma and brain samples were simultaneously obtained. For the Minto model (five patients), the median performance error was 72% for plasma and -14% for brain tissue concentration predictions. The model tended to underestimate plasma remifentanil concentrations, and to overestimate brain tissue remifentanil concentrations. For the Marsh model (five patients), the median prediction errors for plasma and brain tissue concentrations were 12% and 81%, respectively. However, when the data from all blood propofol assays (36 patients) were analysed, the median prediction error was 11%, with overprediction in 15 (42%) patients and underprediction in 21 (58%). These findings confirm earlier reports demonstrating inaccuracy for commonly used pharmacokinetic-dynamic models for plasma concentrations and extend these findings to the prediction of effect-site concentrations.},

Collaboration amongst clinicians within networks instead of competition between clinicians can have wide-ranging benefits that extend beyond research, and can include improvements in training, rapid dissemination of protocols, and knowledge concerning new problems, ultimately improving general standards of care.},

  abstract = {Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) using a mixture of propofol and remifentanil in the same syringe has become an accepted technique in Pediatric Anesthesia. A survey by a group of respected UK anesthetists demonstrated a low incidence of serious complications, related to the pharmacology and dose of the drugs. However, a current guideline for the safe use of TIVA recommends against this practice. Pharmaceutical concerns include the physical stability of the emulsion when remifentanil is mixed with propofol; changes in drug concentration over time; nonuniform mixing of propofol and remifentanil; the risk of bacterial contamination; and the potential for drug administration errors. Propofol and remifentanil have markedly different pharmacokinetic profiles. When remifentanil is mixed with propofol and delivered as a target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol, remifentanil delivery is not target-controlled but passively follows the variable infusion rates calculated by the syringe driver to deliver predicted plasma or effect-site concentrations of propofol. The pharmacokinetic consequences can be illustrated using pharmacokinetic modeling similar to that used in TCI pumps. The clinical consequences reflect the dose-dependent pharmacodynamics of remifentanil. Increasing the target propofol concentration produces a rapid increase and peak in remifentanil concentration that risks apnea, bradycardia, and hypotension, especially with higher concentrations of remifentanil. The faster decline in remifentanil concentration with falling propofol concentrations risks inadequate narcosis and unwanted responses to surgical stimuli. Remifentanil delivery is inflexible and dosing cannot be adjusted to the clinical need and responses of individual patients. The medicolegal considerations are stark. In UK and EU Law, mixing propofol and remifentanil creates a new, unlicensed drug and the person mixing takes on the responsibilities of manufacturer. If a patient receiving anesthesia in the form of a mixed propofol-remifentanil infusion suffered a critical incident or actual harm, the clinician's practice may come under scrutiny and criticism, potentially involving a legal challenge and the Medical Regulator.},

  abstract = {In laboratory animals, exposure to most general anaesthetics leads to neurotoxicity manifested by neuronal cell death and abnormal behaviour and cognition. Some large human cohort studies have shown an association between general anaesthesia at a young age and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficits, but these studies are prone to bias. Others have found no evidence for an association. We aimed to establish whether general anaesthesia in early infancy affects neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this international, assessor-masked, equivalence, randomised, controlled trial conducted at 28 hospitals in Australia, Italy, the USA, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, we recruited infants of less than 60 weeks' postmenstrual age who were born at more than 26 weeks' gestation and were undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy, without previous exposure to general anaesthesia or risk factors for neurological injury. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a web-based randomisation service to receive either awake-regional anaesthetic or sevoflurane-based general anaesthetic. Anaesthetists were aware of group allocation, but individuals administering the neurodevelopmental assessments were not. Parents were informed of their infants group allocation upon request, but were told to mask this information from assessors. The primary outcome measure was full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) on the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, third edition (WPPSI-III), at 5 years of age. The primary analysis was done on a per-protocol basis, adjusted for gestational age at birth and country, with multiple imputation used to account for missing data. An intention-to-treat analysis was also done. A difference in means of 5 points was predefined as the clinical equivalence margin. This completed trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00756600. Between Feb 9, 2007, and Jan 31, 2013, 4023 infants were screened and 722 were randomly allocated: 363 (50%) to the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 359 (50%) to the general anaesthesia group. There were 74 protocol violations in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and two in the general anaesthesia group. Primary outcome data for the per-protocol analysis were obtained from 205 children in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 242 in the general anaesthesia group. The median duration of general anaesthesia was 54 min (IQR 41-70). The mean FSIQ score was 99·08 (SD 18·35) in the awake-regional anaesthesia group and 98·97 (19·66) in the general anaesthesia group, with a difference in means (awake-regional anaesthesia minus general anaesthesia) of 0·23 (95% CI -2·59 to 3·06), providing strong evidence of equivalence. The results of the intention-to-treat analysis were similar to those of the per-protocol analysis. Slightly less than 1 h of general anaesthesia in early infancy does not alter neurodevelopmental outcome at age 5 years compared with awake-regional anaesthesia in a predominantly male study population.

This study investigates the occurrence of intestinal integrity loss during oncologic surgery, measured by I-FABP change. Secondary the relationship between compromised intestinal integrity, and related variables and complications were studied. Patients undergoing oncologic surgery from prospective cohort studies were included. Urine I-FABP samples were collected preoperatively (T0) and at wound closure (T1), and in a subgroup on Day 1 (D1) and Day 2 (D2) postoperatively. I-FABP dynamics were investigated and logistic regression analyses were performed to study the association between I-FABP levels and patient-related, surgical variables and complications. A total of 297 patients were included with median age of 70 years. Median I-FABP value increased from 80.0 pg/mL at T0 (interquartile range [IQR] 38.0-142.0) to 115 pg/mL at T1 (IQR 48.0-198.0) (p < 0.05). Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.08) and anesthesia time (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02-1.25) were related to stronger I-FABP increase. When comparing I-FABP change in patients experiencing any complications versus no complications, relative I-FABP change at T1 was 145% of T0 (IQR 86-260) versus 113% (IQR 44-184) respectively (p < 0.05). A significant change in I-FABP levels was seen perioperatively indicating compromised intestinal integrity. Age and anesthesia time were related to higher I-FABP increase. In patients experiencing postoperative complications, a higher I-FABP increase was found.},

Although POCD has been the subject of considerable research over the past decades, it remains uncertain why some patients do not return to preoperative levels of cognitive function. Surgery and anesthesia have both been implicated to play a role in POCD development, and certain patient-related factors, such as advanced age and low preoperative baseline cognitive function, have consistently been found to predict postoperative cognitive decline. This article will present an overview of POCD and its etiology and provide advice on possible strategies on its prevention.},

The present study explores human inter-rater agreement in sleep stage scoring following the AASM guidelines, within a heterogenous ICU patient cohort. Two human experts independently scored a total of 51,454 epochs in 20 PSG recordings acquired at the ICU. Epoch-per-epoch comparison of scored stages revealed a Cohen's κ coefficient of agreement of 0.36 for standard 5-stage scoring. Highest agreement occurred in Wake (κ = 0.46), while REM showed the lowest (κ = 0.12). Significant correlations were found between inter-rater agreement, and Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II, r = - 0.506, p = 0.038), and 12-month mortality (r = - 0.524, p = 0.031).

The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate the incidence of events with potential adverse health consequences within this service model and the risk factors for the occurrence of these events. We retrospectively interrogated a database containing the computerized anesthetic records of 2937 procedures where moderate-to-deep sedation was provided using TCI administration of propofol and remifentanil between May 2014 and October 2017. The primary outcome measures were the incidence of sedation-related events with potential adverse health consequences and risk factors for the occurrence of such events. The events under investigation were unplanned intensive care unit (ICU) admission, need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), death on the day of the procedure due to sedation-related events, cardiovascular events (arrhythmias, hypertension, and hypotension), pulmonary events (aspiration, desaturation, unplanned tracheal intubation), anaphylactic or allergic reactions, and the termination of the procedure due to sedation-related events. Cardiovascular and pulmonary events were classified as severe, significant, or moderate. Events were identified by using computer algorithms to search the computerized records from all included procedures. Data from 2937 procedures were analyzed. No patients suffered catastrophic events (death, need for CPR, or unplanned ICU admission). Thirty-two severe sedation-related events occurred in 32 procedures. Severe desaturation (0.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-0.9) and severe hypertension (0.2%; 95% CI, 0.04-0.37) were the most common severe events. Significant hypotension (8.8%; 95% CI, 7.73-9.77) and significant desaturation (1.6%; 95% CI, 1.12-2.02) were found to be the most common events with potential adverse health consequences. No patient suffered lasting health consequences. Average mean and maximum targeted effect-site concentrations (Cet) for propofol were 2.6 ± 0.83 and 3.3 ± 1.09 µg·mL, respectively, and for remifentanil 0.84 ± 0.18 and 0.99 ± 0.22 ng·mL, respectively. Maximum Cets of propofol were lower among patients with higher body mass index (BMI) and were higher among patients of younger age. Higher BMI was a risk factor for desaturation. Increased age and lower BMI were risk factors for hypotension. Longer procedure time was a risk factor for both desaturation and hypotension. Moderate-to-deep sedation by propofol and remifentanil TCI has a low incidence of catastrophic and severe events.},

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models can increase the accuracy of intravenous drug titration, especially in populations that differ from the 'average.' However, with a growing number of PKPD models, and other technology available to date, it can be hard to see the wood for the trees. This review attempts to guide the reader through the PKPD jungle. General purpose PKPD models for propofol and remifentanil designed to apply to a broader population, including children, the elderly and the obese, reduce the need for population-specific models. PKPD models for drugs such as dexmedetomidine and antimicrobial agents may be useful for procedural sedation or in the ICU. Technological advances such as Bayesian model adjustment based on point-of-care plasma concentration measurements, closed-loop drug delivery and artificial intelligence may improve the ease of use of the anaesthetic drugs and increase the accuracy of titration. Newer and more complex modelling techniques and technological advancements can help to deliver anaesthetic drugs, sedatives and other drugs in a more stable and thereby safer way.},

NCD affected 12.3% of elderly patients (age ≥ 70 years, n = 57) at 3 months after surgery, with executive function mostly affected. By contrast, 8.4% of younger patients (age < 70 years, n = 107) were affected, with information processing speed mostly affected. Low educational attainment was a risk factor (OR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.9-19.0) of overall NCD, whereas preoperative anxiety was associated with decline in the domain of executive function. Postoperative NCD is a complication of oncological surgery for all adults instead of the elderly only. Preoperative anxiety was associated with an increased risk of executive function decline, and low educational attainment was a key factor for overall NCD.},

This review focuses on recent comparative studies of commonly used and new drugs for adult ambulatory sedation. Midazolam and propofol are commonly used for ambulatory sedation. Their pharmacological properties offer many advantages and there is much experience with their use. Ketamine can be a useful addition to hypnotic drugs but the advantage of the use of ketofol (a mixture of propofol and ketamine) is, although often practiced, difficult to assess. Dexmedetomidine is a relatively new sedative drug and many studies suggest advantages. New findings about its effects, however, show that the hemodynamic consequences of the use of dexmedetomidine may last for several hours. New sedative drugs for procedural sedation are still being developed: remimazolam has many properties that would make it an ideal sedative and has been studied in a phase 3 study. The properties that would constitute the ideal sedative have yet to be combined in one drug. The selection of the drugs used for ambulatory sedation depends on many factors such as procedure type, patient characteristics and the expectations of patients and the healthcare provider. Because of this, the literature cannot yet provide a definitive answer to the question which drug is best selected in a specific situation.},

In recent years, successful attempts have been made to harmonize these criteria and, consequently, to improve public trust in the process and diagnosis. An international multidisciplinary collaboration has been created and it has published minimum criteria, provided guidance for professionals and encouragement to revise or develop guidelines on brain death/DNC worldwide. There are two sets of criteria for declaration of death. First, if there is neither cardiac output nor respiratory effort, then cardiopulmonary criteria are used. Second, if both the cerebrum and brainstem have completely and permanently lost all functions, and there is a persistent coma, absent brainstem reflexes and no spontaneous respiratory effort, death can be declared on the basis of brain death/DNC. Although attempts to formulate uniform criteria are ongoing, consensus has been reached on the minimum criteria. Some inconsistencies and questions remain.},

Before temporary colostomy take-down: anal leakage and discomfort, dignity impairment, struggling to locate the contracting muscle, restoring anal strength. After colostomy take-down: loss of defecating control again and damage to peri-anal skin, perceived effects and insistence on persisting with training, faith in effectiveness, trying to comply, trying to restrict medication use, maintaining a hygienic self-image and dignity, promoting quality of life, and a chance to regain a normal life. CONCLUSIONS / IMPLICATIONS: Participants described the rehabilitation exercise as beneficial to controlling the defecation and expressed their intent to continue such.

To determine the rate-limiting steps in Se volatilization from selenate and selenite, time- and concentration-dependent kinetics of Se accumulation and volatilization were studied in Indian mustard (Brassica juncea). Time-dependent kinetic studies showed that selenate was taken up 2-fold faster than selenite. Selenate was rapidly translocated to the shoot, away from the root, the site of volatilization, whereas only approximately 10% of the selenite was translocated. For both selenate- and selenite-supplied plants, Se accumulation and volatilization increased linearly with external Se concentration up to 20 &mgr;M; volatilization rates were also linearly correlated with root Se concentrations. Se-volatilization rates were 2- to 3-fold higher from plants supplied with selenite compared with selenate. Se speciation by x-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that selenite-supplied plants accumulated organic Se, most likely selenomethionine, whereas selenate-supplied plants accumulated selenate. Our data suggest that Se volatilization from selenate is limited by the rate of selenate reduction, as well as by the availability of Se in roots, as influenced by uptake and translocation. Se volatilization from selenite may be limited by selenite uptake and by the conversion of selenomethionine to dimethylselenide.},

The three animal groups were indistinguishable in their external physical characteristics, sensorimotor skills and indices of anxiety-like behaviors. In the open field, however, homozygous animals were hyperactive and appeared to show less habituation to the initially novel environment. In the Morris water maze, homozygous animals displayed clear deficits in spatial learning and memory with marginal deficits in visual association learning. Apart from the last mentioned deficits, these abnormalities are consistent with hippocampal dysfunction and in some cases with elevated dopaminergic transmission via D2 dopamine receptors. As similar deficits in spatial learning and memory have been found in schizophrenia, where decreased dysbindin-1 has been found in the hippocampus, the sandy mouse may also model certain aspects of cognition and behavior relevant to schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to describe the CT and MR imaging findings of gouty tophi in the wrist and present this entity as a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome. Retrospective review of the CT (n = 18) and MR imaging (n = 20) studies of the wrist in patients with a documented diagnosis of gout who presented with gout-related carpal tunnel syndrome was performed; images of 24 wrists were collected over a 5-year period. Patient population included 20 men, who ranged in age from 35 to 76 years. All images were reviewed by two musculoskeletal radiologists who reached a consensus opinion. Surgical correlation was available in 12 patients. Tophi were found in the floor of the carpal tunnel (n = 18), carpal bones (n = 17), radiocarpal joint (n = 17), and extensor tendons or tendon sheaths (n = 16) of the wrist. All tophi showed similar signal characteristics (from low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images with heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images) with the exception of tophi in the floor of the carpal tunnel (low signal intensity on T2-weighted images). Varying degrees of calcification were noted on CT and MR imaging studies. Gadolinium-enhanced MR studies showed heterogeneous enhancement. Gouty tophi should be entertained as a cause of carpal tunnel syndrome in the appropriate patient population. Familiarity with this entity and its imaging characteristics may prove helpful in diagnosis and preoperative planning.},

In order to improve PAC nursing education and quality of care, the present study applies a modified Delphi method to identify the core competences of nurses who provide PAC services to acute stroke patients. We surveyed 18 experts in post-acute care and long-term care anonymously using a 29-question questionnaire in order to identify the essential professional skills that are required to perform PAC effectively. The results of this survey indicate that the core competences of PAC may be divided into two categories: Case Management and Care Management. Case Management includes Direct Care, Communication, Health Care Education, Nursing Consulting, and Family Assessment & Health Care. Care Management includes Interdisciplinary Teamwork, Patient Care Management, and Resource Integration. The importance and practicality of each item was evaluated using a 7-point Likert scale. The experts required 2 rounds to reach a consensus about the importance and 3 rounds to determine the practicality of PAC core competences. This process highlighted the differing points of view that are held by professionals in the realms of nursing, medicine, and national health policy. The PAC in-job training program in its current form inadequately cul-tivates core competence in Care Management. The results of the present study may be used to inform the development of PAC nurse orientation training programs and continuing education courses.},

The 3D model was modified, placed inside a digitally designed housing unit and fabricated on a desktop 3D printer using polylactic acid (PLA) filament. The model was filled with an echogenic solution of gelatin with psyllium fiber. Twenty-two staff anesthesiologists performed a spinal and epidural on the 3D printed simulator and a commercially available Simulab phantom. Participants evaluated the tactile and ultrasound imaging fidelity of both phantoms via Likert-scale questionnaire. The 3D printed neuraxial phantom cost $13 to print and required 25 hours of non-supervised printing and 2 hours of assembly time. The 3D printed phantom was found to be less realistic to surface palpation than the Simulab phantom due to fragility of the silicone but had significantly better fidelity for loss of resistance, dural puncture and ultrasound imaging than the Simulab phantom. Low-cost neuraxial phantoms with fidelity comparable to commercial models can be produced using CT data and low-cost infrastructure consisting of FLOS software and desktop 3D printers.},

The effect of insulin administration on renal potassium excretion is unclear. Some studies suggest that insulin has an antikaliuretic effect although plasma potassium levels were poorly controlled. Since the introduction of glycemic control in the intensive care unit, insulin use has increased. We examined the relation between administered insulin and renal potassium excretion in critically ill patients under computer-assisted glucose and potassium regulation. Prospective observational study. Twelve-bed surgical intensive care unit of a university teaching hospital. Consecutive intensive care unit patients. Potassium and glucose levels were regulated by a computer-assisted decision support system. Both potassium and insulin were continuously administered by syringe pump. Renal potassium excretion was measured daily in the 24-hr urine collections. The 24-hr urinary samples of patients with kidney failure or on renal replacement therapy were excluded. Multivariate analysis with potassium excretion as the dependent variable was performed. In 178 consecutive patients, 1,456 24-hr urinary samples, were analyzed. Mean ± SD plasma potassium was 4.2 ± 0.3 mmol/L, with 79 ± 46 mmol/d of potassium administered and a mean insulin dose of 53 ± 38 U/day. Renal potassium excretion was 126 ± 51 mmol/day. After multivariate analysis correcting for relevant variables (including diuretics, pH, potassium levels and renal sodium excretion), insulin administration was independently and positively associated with renal potassium excretion. Other significant variables were potassium levels, potassium administration, renal sodium and chloride excretion, creatinine clearance, diuretic therapy, pH, known diabetes and intensive care unit admission day (R = .52; p <. 001). Insulin administration is associated with an increase in the renal potassium excretion in critically ill patients.},

The RAARR algorithm can automatically assign experimental spectra under a broad range of conditions, including spectra comprised of multiple mixture components, in ≲100 s. The RAARR algorithm exploits constraints placed by the conservation of energy to find sets of connected lines in an unassigned spectrum. The highly constrained structure of these sets eliminates all but a handful of plausible assignments for a given set, greatly reducing the number of potential assignments that must be evaluated. We successfully apply our algorithm to automatically assign 15 experimental spectra, including 5 previously unassigned species, without prior estimation of molecular rotational constants. In 9 of the 15 cases, the RAARR algorithm successfully assigns two or more mixture components.},

Since the inflammatory milieu can cause important alterations in epithelial cell function, we examined the cytokine effects on the expression of the enterocyte differentiation marker, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP), a protein that detoxifies bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and limits fat absorption. Sodium butyrate (NaBu), a short-chain fatty acid and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, was used to induce IAP expression in HT-29 cells and the cells were also treated +/- the cytokines. Northern blots confirmed IAP induction by NaBu, however, pretreatment (6 h) with either cytokine showed a dose-dependent inhibition of IAP expression. IAP Western analyses and alkaline phosphatase enzyme assays corroborated the Northern data and confirmed that the cytokines inhibit IAP induction. Transient transfections with a reporter plasmid carrying the human IAP promoter showed significant inhibition of NaBu-induced IAP gene activation by the cytokines (100 and 60% inhibition with IL-1beta and TNF-alpha, respectively). Western analyses showed that NaBu induced H4 and H3 histone acetylation, and pretreatment with IL-1beta or TNF-alpha did not change this global acetylation pattern. In contrast, chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that local histone acetylation of the IAP promoter region was specifically inhibited by either cytokine. We conclude that IL-1beta and TNF-alpha inhibit NaBu-induced IAP gene expression, likely by blocking the histone acetylation within its promoter. Cytokine-mediated IAP gene silencing may have important implications for gut epithelial function in the setting of intestinal inflammatory conditions.},

  abstract = {An adjuvant is a chemical incorporated into vaccines that enhances their efficacy by improving the immune response. Identifying adjuvant names from cancer vaccine studies is essential for furthering research and enhancing immunotherapies. However, the manual curation from the constantly expanding biomedical literature poses significant challenges. This study explores the automated recognition of vaccine adjuvant names using state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) and Large Language Model Meta AI (Llama). We utilized two datasets: 97 clinical trial records from AdjuvareDB and 290 PubMed abstracts annotated with the Vaccine Adjuvant Compendium (VAC). Two LLMs, GPT-4o and Llama 3.2 were employed in zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms with up to four examples per prompt. Prompts explicitly targeted adjuvant names, testing the impact of contextual information such as substances or interventions. Outputs underwent automated and manual validation for accuracy and consistency. GPT-4o consistently attained 100% Precision across all situations, while also exhibiting notable enhancements in Recall and F1-scores, particularly with the incorporation of interventions. On the VAC dataset, GPT-4o achieved a maximum F1-score of 77.32% with interventions, surpassing Llama-3.2-3B by approximately 2%. On the AdjuvareDB dataset, GPT-4o reached an F1-score of 81.67% for three-shot prompting with interventions, surpassing Llama-3.2-3B's maximum F1-score of 65.62%. These results highlight the critical role of contextual information in enhancing model performance, with GPT-4o demonstrating a superior ability to leverage this enrichment. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at accurately identifying adjuvant names, including rare and novel variations of naming representation. This study emphasizes the capability of LLMs to enhance cancer vaccine development by efficiently extracting insights from clinical trial data. Future work aims to broaden the framework to encompass a wider array of biomedical literature and enhance model generalizability across various vaccines and adjuvants.

Since granule exocytosis from neutrophils is regulated by ion fluxes, we examined the effect of protein I on neutrophil activation. Pretreatment with protein I (250 nM) impaired degranulation from neutrophils: beta-glucuronidase release decreased to 27 +/- 6% S.E. of cells treated with N-f-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP, 0.1 microM) and to 13 +/- 4% of cells treated with leukotriene B4 (LTB4, 0.1 microM); lysozyme release decreased to 52 +/- 17% of fMLP-treated cells and 22 +/- 9% of LTB4-treated cells. Morphometric analysis was consistent: control neutrophils increased their surface membrane after fMLP (43.3 +/- 5.6 microns relative perimeter versus 71.4 +/- 3.7 microns) while protein I-treated neutrophils did not (29.4 +/- 2 (S.E.) microns relative perimeter versus 34 +/- 4 microns). Enzyme release after exposure to phorbol myristate acetate was not affected (lysozyme: 86 +/- 27% of control). Cell/cell aggregation in response to fMLP was inhibited by treatment with protein I. However, generation of O2 was not affected. Protein I altered the surface membrane potential (Oxonol V): protein I evoked a transient membrane hyperpolarization which was not inhibited by furosemide. After exposure to fMLP, protein I-treated neutrophils underwent a furosemide-sensitive hyperpolarization rather than the usual depolarization. Protein I did not alter increments in [Ca]i (Fura-2) stimulated by fMLP (460 +/- 99 nM (S.E.) versus 377 +/- 44 nM) nor decrements in [pH]i (7.22 +/- 0.04 S.E. versus 7.22 +/- 0.02, bis-(carboxy-ethyl)carboxyfluorescein). The results suggest that degranulation and O2 generation have separate ionic requirements and that protein I interrupts the activation sequence proximal to activation of protein kinase C.},

Each of 36 athletes with shoulder pain aggravated by abduction and external rotation was examined in a single visit during which conventional radiography, arthrography, CT arthrography, and MR arthrography were performed. In 17 of these athletes, imaging findings were compared with those at arthroscopy. All images were independently evaluated by two groups of musculoskeletal radiologists. Structures found to be affected were, in decreasing order of frequency, the following: the posterosuperior labrum, supraspinatus tendon, infraspinatus tendon, humeral head, glenoid cavity and rim, acromioclavicular joint, anteroinferior capsulolabral complex, biceps tendon, and subscapularis tendon. MR arthrography without and with abduction and external rotation yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity for all lesions with the exceptions of bone sclerosis and enthesophytes (which were best seen with CT arthrography). MR arthrography with abduction and external rotation was most accurate for diagnosis of rotator cuff and anteroinferior capsulolabral complex tears. On the basis of these preliminary results, we believe that MR arthrography with abduction and external rotation should be part of the imaging evaluation of shoulder pain in throwing athletes, owing to the high sensitivity of this imaging technique.},

Outcome indicators include: Services utilized (emergency services, re-hospitalization), physiological status (catheter indwelling status, consciousness level, wound severity-number and wound stages) and functional status (reflected by Barthel Index). A prospective research design was used to collect the results. Five hospital-based HHNAs were invited to participate in this research. Clients newly admitted to HHNAs and diagnosed as non-cancer patients were recruited, and the researchers gathered outcome indicators over a six-month period. Data were analyzed using SPSS 8.0 computer software. There were 75 clients in this study. Results showed that most of the clients (64.0%) received service for more than 180 days. The client characteristics were dominated by elderly (66.6% age above 70), female (53.3%) and married (74.7%). The three leading care needs were NG tubing service (84.0%), Foley tubing service (45.3%) and wound care (38.7%). The Kruscal Wallis Test revealed that there was no difference in emergency service frequency and re-hospitalization between clients who received service for more than 180 days and those who received service for less than 180 days. The Wilcoxon Sign rank test showed that within one half-year, catheter indwelling status, functional status, and wound severity were not significantly different, with the exception only of conscious level (p = .001). The results of this study can be viewed as preliminary data to assist in shaping home health nursing services in Taiwan.},

Ideally, the endpoint metric should be an objective comparison of the trainee-acquired image with a reference ideal image. Therefore, we developed a simulator-based methodology of preclinical verification of proficiency (VOP) in trainees by tracking objective evaluation of the final acquired images. We utilized geometric data from the simulator probes to compare image acquisition of anesthesia residents who participated in our structured longitudinal simulator-based TEE educational program vs ideal image planes determined from a panel of experts. Thirty-three participants completed the study (15 experts, 7 postgraduate year (PGY)-1 and 11 PGY-4). The results of our study demonstrated a significant difference in image capture success rates between learners and experts (χ2 = 14.716, df = 2, P < 0.001) with the difference between learners (PGY-1 and PGY-4) not being statistically significant (χ2 = 0, df = 1, P = 1.000). Therefore, our results suggest that novices (i.e. PGY-1 residents) are capable of attaining a level of proficiency comparable to those with modest training (i.e. PGY-4 residents) after completion of a simulation-based training curriculum. However, professionals with years of clinical training (i.e. attending physicians) exhibit a superior mastery of such skills. It is hence feasible to develop a simulator-based VOP program in performance of TEE for junior anesthesia residents.},

Diagnostic MR features of deltoid muscle contracture include fibrotic cord in the deltoid muscle, especially its middle portion, extending from the superior acromial surface to the deltoid tuberosity, and winging of the scapula (increased winging angle of the scapula). Characteristic radiographic features include abduction contracture, winging of the scapula, lateral down-sloping of the acromial process, and a superior acromial enthesophyte.

Materials and Methods Cases selected from a radiology textbook series spanning a variety of imaging modalities, subspecialties, and anatomic pathologies were converted into standardized prompts that were entered into ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 algorithms; April 3 to June 1, 2023). Responses were analyzed for accuracy via comparison with the final diagnosis and top 3 differential diagnosis provided in the textbook, which served as the ground truth. Reliability, defined based on the frequency of algorithmic hallucination, was assessed through the identification of factually incorrect statements and fabricated references. Comparisons were made between the algorithms using the McNemar test and a generalized estimating equation model framework.

  abstract = {This review explores the current landscape of AI applications in imaging for TAVR, emphasizing the potential and limitations of these tools for (1) automating the image analysis and reporting process, (2) improving procedural planning, and (3) offering additional insight into post-TAVR outcomes. Finally, the direction of future research necessary to bridge these tools towards clinical integration is discussed. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a pivotal treatment option for select patients with severe aortic stenosis, and its indication for use continues to broaden. Noninvasive imaging techniques such as CTA and MRA have become routine for patient selection, preprocedural planning, and predicting the risk of complications. As the current methods for pre-TAVR image analysis are labor-intensive and have significant inter-operator variability, experts are looking towards artificial intelligence (AI) as a potential solution. AI has the potential to significantly enhance the planning, execution, and post-procedural follow up of TAVR. While AI tools are promising, the irreplaceable value of nuanced clinical judgment by skilled physician teams must not be overlooked. With continued research, collaboration, and careful implementation, AI can become an integral part in imaging for TAVR, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.},

This study aims to assess the multimodal capabilities of contemporary large language models, which allow analysis of image inputs in addition to textual data, on radiology board-style examination questions with images. 280 questions were retrospectively selected from the AuntMinnie public test bank. The test questions were converted into three formats of prompts; (1) Multimodal, (2) Image-only, and (3) Text-only input. Three models, GPT-4V, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, were evaluated using these prompts. The Cochran Q test and pairwise McNemar test were used to compare performances between prompt formats and models. No difference was found for the performance in terms of % correct answers between the text, image, and multimodal prompt formats for GPT-4V (54%, 52%, and 57%, respectively; p = .31) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (53%, 54%, and 57%, respectively; p = .53). For Claude 3.5 Sonnet, the image input (48%) significantly underperformed compared to the text input (63%, p < .001) and the multimodal input (66%, p < .001), but no difference was found between the text and multimodal inputs (p = .29). Claude significantly outperformed GPT and Gemini in the text and multimodal formats (p < .01). Vision-capable large language models cannot effectively use images to increase performance on radiology board-style examination questions. When using textual data alone, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Pro, highlighting the advancements in the field and its potential for use in further research.},

The GRIP-COMPASS study was a prospective double-blinded interventional study in 910 patients after cardiac surgery (coronary artery bypass grafting and/or valvular surgery). Patients were assigned to either the normal-low potassium target (nLP group, 4.0 mmol/L) or the normal-high potassium target (nHP group, 4.5 mmol/L) in alternating blocks of 50 patients. Potassium levels were regulated using a validated computer-assisted potassium replacement protocol (GRIP-II). The primary end point was the incidence of AF/AFL on a 12-lead electrocardiogram during the first postoperative week. Of the 910 patients, 447 were assigned to the nLP group; and 463, to the nHP group, with no baseline differences between the 2 groups. The mean daily administered dose of potassium was 30 ± 23 mmol (nLP) versus 52 ± 27 mmol (nHP) (P < .001), which resulted in mean intensive care unit potassium concentration of 4.22 ± 0.36 mmol/L and 4.33 ± 0.34 mmol/L, respectively (P < .001). The incidence of AF/AFL after cardiac surgery did not differ: 38% in the nLP group and 41% in the nHP group. Also in several subgroups (eg, patients not known with prior AF/AFL or with valve surgery), there were no differences. There were no differences in incidence of AF/AFL with 2 potassium regulation strategies with different potassium targets and different amounts of potassium administered in patients after cardiac surgery.},

We encountered a situation where the giant neck masses of a patient pushed the epiglottis posteriorly toward the posterior pharyngeal wall and compressed the laryngeal aperture narrowing after anesthetic induction, causing direct laryngoscopic intubation and sequential fiber-optic intubation failed. The neck masses twisted the aryepiglottic fold tortuously and clogged the laryngeal aperture tightly, making a flexible fiber-optic bronchoscope unable to pass through the laryngeal aperture. Later, we utilized a McCoy laryngoscope alternately to lift the compressed larynx up and away from the posterior pharyngeal wall, creating a passage and completing endotracheal intubation successfully with the aid of a gum elastic bougie. Our case suggested that the tilting tip blade of the McCoy laryngoscope could lever the tongue base up against the tumor mass compression to improve laryngeal views and facilitate endotracheal intubation when a difficult fiber-optic intubation was encountered on a compressed laryngeal aperture.},

While the concept of child abuse and related factors have been widely explored in interdisciplinary studies, a definition of 'child abuse' that is both precise and consistent has yet to be given. Lack of such limits the ability of clinicians to identify child abuse in clinical settings, and creates difficulties in conducting rigorous scientific research studies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to analyze the concept of child abuse based on literature published between 1960 and 2008 (n = 32) using Walker and Avant's concept analysis model in which child abuse is determined along two dimensions. These dimensions include the objective physical dimension, which addresses children younger than 20 years of age who experience repeated injuries or whose history of injury is incompatible with the findings of physical examinations, and the subjective psychological dimension, which addresses children who were treated unfairly or malevolently and their subsequent subjective feelings. Antecedents consist of abuser, victim, and environmental characteristics. Consequences include both physical and psychological aspects. Nurses and other professionals should benefit from a clearer definition of child abuse in their clinical and research settings.},

Our study shows that the electrokinetic energy conversion performance (maximum efficiency, pressure rise and streaming potential) are approximately identical for 1:1 (KCl), 2:1 (CaCl2) and 3:1 (LaCl3) electrolytes when capillary is positively charged. For negatively charged capillary, energy conversion performance degrades significantly with the increase of counter-ion valence. For both positively and negatively charged capillaries, higher maximum efficiency can be resulted in low bulk concentration and surface charge density regimes. However, high maximum pressure rise generation for the pumping is found in the low bulk concentration and high surface charge density regimes. For the electric power generation, higher maximum streaming potential is found when both bulk concentration and surface charge density are low.},

Built environment design is recognized as important in the care and management of responsive behaviors for those living with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in secured dementia care units (e.g., exiting attempts, agitation). The repetitious behavior of "walking with purpose" (previously termed wandering) in those with dementia has influenced safety-related architectural design components of dementia care units that decrease exiting attempts. Empirical literature addressing design interventions to prevent exiting for those with dementia is lacking and outdated. We sought to describe known design techniques through a topical analysis of experimental studies. A thorough search for empirical studies that assessed interior design interventions at exit doors within dementia care units was undertaken. The review included an extensive search for existing literature and a screening of each study identified for its relevance, quality, and applicability. The experimental studies included in the review collectively assessed five interior design interventions at egress doorways: implementing horizontal and vertical floor grid patterns, mirrors, murals, conditioning responses to color cues, and camouflaging door hardware or vision panels. Why empirical studies have not continued more recently as built environment trends have shifted toward promoting meaningful and purposeful movement through design are considered. Advances in our understanding around the pathophysiology of dementia which might affect future design interventions related to egress are also identified. The built environment is an important part of dementia care, and further prospective research is needed on the role of design interventions in the context of exiting attempts within secured units and subsequent behavior outcomes.},

It can occur in a balanced or unbalanced form and as a sole abnormality is associated with an intermediate prognosis. Additionally, this translocation is observed in the context of hyperdiploid B-ALL, in which case it is associated with a poor prognosis. However, due to different translocation partner genes at chromosomes 1 and 19, distinct subtypes of hyperdiploid B-ALL with t(1;19)/der(19)t(1;19) are recognized based on the presence or absence of the TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene, but the cytogenetic and etiologic differences between the two remain understudied. We report a case of an adult with a history of relapsed precursor B-ALL whose conventional cytogenetics showed an abnormal female karyotype with both hyperdiploidy and a t(1;19)(q23;p13). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on previously G-banded metaphases using the LSI TCF3/PBX1 Dual Color, Dual Fusion Translocation Probe confirmed the presence of the TCF3-PBX1 gene fusion. This particular pattern with a TCF3-PBX1 fusion within the context of a hyperdiploid karyotype is seen in B-ALL and is usually associated with a poor outcome. This case is one of only a few cases with both hyperdiploidy and a confirmed TCF3-PBX1 fusion, demonstrating the importance of using FISH for proper molecular classification of these cases in order to distinguish them from those with hyperdiploidy but no TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene. Such molecular studies may provide insight into the precise differences between TCF3-PBX1 positive and negative hyperdiploid B-ALL bearing the t(1;19)(q23;p13).},

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes, used in Western countries since 1980, have not been readily used in Taiwanese long-term care facilities since their introduction in 1995. Instead, nasogastric tubes are used for extended periods. The reasons for limited percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use among long-term care residents are unknown. A phenomenologic qualitative design using in-depth semi-structured interviews collected the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use experiences of directors of long-term care facilities. The directors also provided descriptive data on the prevalence of feeding tubes among their residents. Eight directors of long-term care facilities in southern Taiwan participated in tape-recorded interviews. Data were thematically analysed using the methods of Strauss and Corbin. Feeding tube prevalence data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Four themes emerged as contributing to limited percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use in long-term care facilities: acceptability, availability, affordability and accountability. Over one-third of the residents required feeding tubes with 97% of those having nasogastric tube. Nasogastric tubes were used for a year or more in over half of the patients requiring enteral feeding. Chinese cultural values play a significant role in influencing end-of-life care and decisions about percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use. Nursing directors in long-term care assume a gatekeeper role to promote acceptability, provide availability and ensure accountability of nutritional interventions. Policy makers must be engaged to promote the affordability of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy use among long-term care residents. To improve nutritional outcomes among long-term care residents, nurses must acknowledge the Chinese culture related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes. Professionals must provide sufficient information about the advantages of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes and discuss with families the meaning of quality of life and suffering at the end-of-life.},

In this work, we investigate the motivations underlying EBEPs as a function of moral values. Specifically, we propose EBEPs may often be best understood as morally motivated behaviors grounded in people's moral values and perceptions of moral violations. As evidence, we report five studies that integrate spatial modeling and experimental methods to investigate the relationship between moral values and EBEPs. Our results, from these U.S. based studies, suggest that moral values oriented around group preservation are predictive of the county-level prevalence of hate groups and associated with the belief that extreme behavioral expressions of prejudice against marginalized groups are justified. Additional analyses suggest that the association between group-based moral values and EBEPs against outgroups can be partly explained by the belief that these groups have done something morally wrong.},

Shorter time to administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with improved outcomes, but early recognition of sepsis remains a major challenge. In a two-center cohort study with prospective sample collection from 1400 adult patients in emergency departments suspected of sepsis, we sought to determine the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of a machine-learning algorithm based on clinical data and a set of uncommonly measured biomarkers. Specifically, we demonstrate that a machine-learning model developed using this dataset outputs a score with not only diagnostic capability but also prognostic power with respect to hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day mortality, and 3-day inpatient re-admission both in our entire testing cohort and various subpopulations. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) for diagnosis of sepsis was 0.83. Predicted risk scores for patients with septic shock were higher compared with patients with sepsis but without shock (p < 0.0001). Scores for patients with infection and organ dysfunction were higher compared with those without either condition (p < 0.0001). Stratification based on predicted scores of the patients into low, medium, and high-risk groups showed significant differences in LOS (p < 0.0001), 30-day mortality (p < 0.0001), and 30-day inpatient readmission (p < 0.0001). In conclusion, a machine-learning algorithm based on electronic medical record (EMR) data and three nonroutinely measured biomarkers demonstrated good diagnostic and prognostic capability at the time of initial blood culture.},

In this study, we used real-time 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to analyze geometric changes in multiple axes of the TA throughout the cardiac cycle in patients without right ventricular abnormalities. R-wave-gated 3D TEE images of the TA were acquired in 39 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. The patients with abnormal right ventricular/tricuspid structure or function were excluded from the study. For each patient, eight points along the TA were traced in the 3D dataset and used to reconstruct the TA at four stages of the cardiac cycle (end- and mid-systole, end- and mid-diastole). Statistical analyses were applied to determine whether TA area, perimeter, axes, and planarity changed significantly over each stage of the cardiac cycle. TA area (P = 0.012) and perimeter (P = 0.024) both changed significantly over the cardiac cycle. Of all the axes, only the posterolateral-anteroseptal demonstrated significant dynamism (P < 0.001). There was also a significant displacement in the vertical axis between the points and the regression plane in end-systole (P < 0.001), mid-diastole (P = 0.014), and mid-systole (P < 0.001).

Three-dimensional R-wave gated, full-volume transesophageal echocardiography images were obtained after deployment of the MitraClip device. A high-quality diastolic frame of the mitral valve was segmented using Mimics Innovation Suite and merged with a flange. The data were exported as a stereolithography (.stl) file, and a rigid 3-dimensional model was printed using a MakerBot Replicator 2 printer. A flexible silicone cast then was created and deployed in the pulse-duplicator chamber filled with a blood-mimicking fluid. The authors were able to obtain continuous-wave Doppler tracings of the valve inflow with a transesophageal echocardiography transducer. They also were able to generate diastolic ventricular and atrial pressure tracings. Pressure half-time and mitral valve area were computed from these measurements. This pulse duplicator shows promising applications in hemodynamic testing of patient-specific anatomy. Future modifications to the system may allow for visualization and data collection of gradients across the aortic valve.},

Reduced expression of this gene and of its encoded protein, dysbindin-1, have been reported in the brains of schizophrenia cases. It has not been established, however, if the protein reductions encompass all dysbindin-1 isoforms or if they are associated with decreased DTNBP1 gene expression. Using a matched pairs design in which each of 28 Caucasian schizophrenia cases was matched in age and sex to a normal Caucasian control, Western blotting of whole-tissue lysates of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) revealed significant reductions in dysbindin-1C (but not in dysbindin-1A or -1B) in schizophrenia (P = 0.022). These reductions occurred without any significant change in levels of the encoding transcript in the same tissue samples and in the absence of the only DTNBP1 risk haplotype for schizophrenia reported in the USA. Indeed, no significant correlations were found between case-control differences in any dysbindin-1 isoform and the case-control differences in its encoding mRNA. Consequently, the mean 60% decrease in dysbindin-1C observed in 71% of our case-control pairs appears to reflect abnormalities in mRNA translation and/or processes promoting dysbindin-1C degradation (e.g. oxidative stress, phosphorylation and/or ubiquitination). Given the predominantly post-synaptic localization of dysbindin-1C and known post-synaptic effects of dysbindin-1 reductions in the rodent equivalent of the DLPFC, the present findings suggest that decreased dysbindin-1C in the DLPFC may contribute to the cognitive deficits of schizophrenia by promoting NMDA receptor hypofunction in fast-spiking interneurons.},

The subsequent resection and pathology revealed intraosseous tophus deposition, which is particularly rare at this site and at this age. Imaging studies revealed some characteristic imaging features which can retrospectively be attributed to gouty tophus. When an expansile osteolytic lesion manifesting low signal intensity on T2-weighted image and internal calcifications on CT scan is encountered, the possibility of intraosseous tophus should be included in the list of differential diagnoses, even in a teenage patient without prior history of gout.},

Previous studies show that students who struggle with the identification and segmentation of speech sounds are more likely to encounter difficulties with clinical phonetic transcription. To clarify the connection between phonemic awareness and phonetic transcription in Mandarin-speaking undergraduate students, as well as the improvement of these skills after phonetic transcription training. A pretest-post-test design was adopted for this study. The experimental group (n = 38) consisted of students majoring in audiology and speech-language pathology who were given 12 weeks of transcription training. The control group (n = 33) consisted of audiology and speech-language pathology majors who completed the same module a year earlier without undergoing the transcription training. Two instruments were used to assess their skills: (1) the Phonemic Awareness Skill Test (PA test) and (2) the Phonetic Transcription Skill Test (PT test) designed for the purposes of the present study. Performance on most subtests of the PT and PA tests improved significantly at post-test for the experiment group, although only PT training was provided. After phonetic transcription training, the relationship between phonemic addition abilities and phonetic transcription strengthened. Phonemic identification was found to be a predictor of undergraduate students' PT skills of disordered speech samples. Results from this study provide insights into the role of phonetic transcription training in improving phonemic awareness and phonetic transcription skills. What is already known on the subject Phonetic transcription of disordered speech samples is especially crucial for the assessment and treatment of functional or organic speech-sound disorders. Phonemic awareness is not only an essential ability for reading alphabetic language but also associated with acquiring phonetic transcription skills. What this paper adds to existing knowledge A dynamically changing association between phonemic transcription and phonetic transcription during transcription training was reported. Phonetic transcription training of disordered speech samples acted as a driving force for deeper relationships between the two skills. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Training phonetic recognition and transcription equips future and practising speech-language pathologists with better skills in managing speech-sound disorders. Implications for phonemic awareness training also have the potential to extend to the literacy skills of alphabetic language speakers.},

Twenty-four sets of images of cadaveric joints were evaluated independently by two observers. These sets consisted of MR arthrographic images obtained with traction (applied to the wrist using 1- to 3-kg weights) and without traction in five shoulders in which SLAP lesions had been excluded arthroscopically or by cadaveric sectioning; and MR arthrographic images obtained with and without traction in seven shoulders in which various types of SLAP lesions had been created arthroscopically and later confirmed by cadaveric sectioning. Analysis of the data indicated that MR arthrography in combination with arm traction and external rotation improved diagnostic accuracy with regard to identification and categorization of SLAP lesions when compared with studies made without traction. The combination of MR arthrography and arm traction with the shoulder in external rotation provides a more effective approach for detection of SLAP lesions than does similar MR arthrography performed without arm traction.},

These transcripts, designated L/S junction-spanning transcripts (L/STs), are synthesized in abundance in a variety of cells infected with mutant viruses defective in the gene for ICP4, the major transcriptional regulatory protein of the virus. Transcription of abundant 2.3- and 8.5-kb series of L/STs was shown to initiate within the same sequences as less abundant 4.2-, 7.3-, and > 9.5-kb transcripts by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. S1 nuclease analysis revealed a single 5' terminus 28 bp downstream of a TATA box and 6 bp downstream of a consensus ICP4 binding site. The location of the transcriptional start site indicates that the promoter of the L/STs likely corresponds to the bidirectional promoter described by Bohenzky et al. (R. A. Bohenzky, A. G. Papavassiliou, I. H. Gelman, and S. Silverstein, J. Virol. 67:632-642, 1993). The L/STs accumulate with late kinetics in ICP4 mutant-infected cells and are polyadenylated. Mutant viruses encoding forms of ICP4 unable to bind the consensus site, ATCGTC, exhibited abundant expression of the L/STs, whereas mutants encoding forms of ICP4 able to bind this site expressed no detectable L/STs, suggesting that ICP4 plays a critical role in repressing L/ST expression. Their synthesis in ICP4 mutant-infected cells is inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating that they are induced either by an immediate-early viral protein other than ICP4 or by a virus-induced cellular protein. Preliminary evidence indicates that the L/STs are not present in latently infected ganglia. The abundant expression of the L/STs with late kinetics only in the absence of functional ICP4 and the sensitivity of their synthesis to cycloheximide indicate that they are not members of any of the recognized kinetic classes of herpes simplex virus type 1 transcripts but constitute a new class of viral transcript.},

Coronal imaging allowed complete visualization of the calcaneofibular, posterior talofibular, tibiocalcaneal, and posterior tibiotalar ligaments. In both imaging planes, differentiation of the deep and superficial layers of the medial collateral ligament was possible. Differentiation between the syndesmotic complex and the lateral collateral ligament was accomplished easily; in particular, differentiation of the posterior tibiofibular ligament from the posterior talofibular ligament was not difficult because of the differing insertions of these ligaments. The inhomogeneous appearance of the medial collateral ligament and the posterior talofibular ligament on MR images correlated with areas of fatty tissue on corresponding microscopic sections.

Whereas it implies chronicity, it lacks specificity in discriminating normal from a significantly remodeled MV apparatus. Regional aspects of MV remodeling have shown superior value over global remodeling in predicting recurrence after MV repair for IMR. Quite possibly, presence of specific regional changes in MV geometry that are unique to chronic IMR patients could also be used to diagnose the presence and track progression of remodeling. Knowledge of these changes in MV apparatus in patients with IMR can possibly be used to identify patients for surgical intervention before irreversible remodeling occurs. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiographic data were collected from patients who underwent MV surgery for IMR (IMR group, n = 66), and from patients with normal valvular and biventricular function (control group, n = 10). The acquired data of the MV were geometrically analyzed to make regional comparisons between the IMR and the control group to identify measurements that reliably differentiate normal from remodeled MVs. Lengthening of the middle potion of the anterior annulus (A2 regional perimeter: 11.149 mm versus 9.798 mm, p = 0.0041), larger nonplanarity angle (147.985 versus 140.720 degrees, p = 0.0459), and increased tenting angle of the posteromedial scallop of the posterior leaflet (P3 tenting angle: 44.354 versus 40.461 degrees, p = 0.0435) were sufficient in differentiating between IMR and the control group. Specific three-dimensional changes in MV geometry can be used to reliably identify a significantly remodeled valve apparatus.},

Allergic contact dermatitis to potties, metal toys, and children's jewelry is well known, however, there is a broad range of skin risks in toys. With the objective to identify and publicize the associated risk of contact dermatitis in children's toys, we have searched the PubMed database from creation to September 9, 2019. Studies were eligible if they reported a new case of contact dermatitis secondary to interaction with a toy in patients from birth to 18 years of age. A toy was defined as something children interact with for entertainment during leisure time. In this review of the PubMed database we filtered by age and language which may have prevented us from detecting cases in adults that could be extrapolated to children. In addition, several articles were excluded based on title alone. A total of 1312 articles were identified and reviewed manually for inclusion criteria. Review of the articles found 25 original articles for consideration. Several toys were found to be associated with contact dermatitis. These included electronics, toy cars, costume jewelry, bicycles, sqwish balls, slime, Play-Doh, and plasticine. Electronics such as video game controllers, cellphones, iPads, and computers were implicated. In conclusion, there is still an unmet need for observation of this segment of industry for labeling of contents and ongoing surveillance.},

HCV-specific antibodies (anti-HCV Ab) in blood specimens were tested for HCV seropositive by the third-generation HCV ELISA system. The subjects, later identified as 152 seropositive and 88 seronegative, were selected for analysis of the correlates of HCV infection. They were interviewed to explore a variety of possible risk factors for HCV infection with a structured questionnaire. The results showed that the anti-HCV age-adjusted seroprevalence was 55.8%. Needle injection was significant to the increased anti-HCV seroprevalence, with multivariate age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) of 1.9 and 1.2-3.9 respectively. This study identifies Ma-Sha-Gou as an endemic area of HCV infection, in which needle injection from any medical activity was a possible transmission pathway in the village, and suggests the health authorities/community health nurses should give the residents a comprehensive community-based education program to interrupt HCV transmission.},

An oval mass with low signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images posterior to the PCL, simulating a PCL ganglion cyst, was seen in all 10 patients. A tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus was also seen in all patients. The sites of communication between the cyst and meniscal tear were observed in sagittal MR images in eight patients. Septation within the cyst and associated joint effusion were seen in eight and four patients, respectively. Arthroscopy in eight patients and transmeniscal needle drainage in the other two patients confirmed both the meniscal tear and the pericruciate meniscal cyst. Pericruciate meniscal cysts cause fluid collections posterior to the PCL, simulating a PCL ganglion cyst. Careful analysis of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus should be performed when a cyst-like structure is seen adjacent to the PCL.},

We did so by regulating expression of MutL homologue MLH 1, which is essential in mismatch repair, in a kidney cell line that had been transduced by an AID-containing vector. Whether or not MLH1 was expressed, we found no difference in the mutation rates of an indicator gene. We conclude that in order to contribute to hypermutation, mismatch repair needs additional factors that are present in activated B lymphocytes, but absent in the cell line investigated.},

The relationships between the environmental factors and CDIs were analysed in a hybrid within- and between-hospital random-effect model.

All inpatients in 129 general hospital trusts of the NHS in the years 2011-2019, covering 120,629 cases of CDI. Annual number of CDIs per hospital trust. Single rooms were associated with fewer CDIs at the within-hospital level, but not at the between-hospital level. Similarly, more nursing staff was associated with fewer CDIs at the within-hospital level, but not at the between-hospital level. This effect was not observed for physician staffing. A different picture emerged for the protective effect of cultural resources, with a weakly significant effect of between-hospital differences, but no within-hospital effect. Financial resources were not associated with CDIs either between hospitals or within them over time. The present study identified hospital resources with a beneficial influence on CDI rates. Healthcare organizations can use this knowledge for active CDI prevention.},

The semiotic framework of Peirce's Universal Categories (UCs) laid ground for a novel cognitive-semiotic typology of social interactions. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 16 volunteers watched a movie narrative encompassing verbal and non-verbal social interactions. Three types of non-verbal interactions were coded ("unresolved," "non-habitual," and "habitual") based on a typology reflecting Peirce's UCs. As expected, the auditory cortex responded to verbal interactions, but non-verbal interactions modulated temporal areas as well. Conceivably, when speech was lacking, ambiguous visual information (unresolved interactions) primed auditory processing in contrast to learned behavioral patterns (habitual interactions). The latter recruited a parahippocampal-occipital network supporting conceptual processing and associative memory retrieval. Requesting semiotic contextualization, non-habitual interactions activated visuo-spatial and contextual rule-learning areas such as the temporo-parietal junction and right lateral prefrontal cortex. In summary, the cognitive-semiotic typology reflected distinct sensory and association networks underlying the interpretation of observed non-verbal social interactions.},

Flow theory is a well-established model developed to describe subjective game experience. In 13 healthy male subjects, we acquired fMRI data during free play of a video game and analyzed brain activity based on the game content. In accordance with flow theory, we extracted the following factors from the game content: (i) balance between ability and challenge; (ii) concentration and focus; (iii) direct feedback of action results; (iv) clear goals; and (v) control over the situation/activity. We suggest that flow is characterized by specific neural activation patterns and that the latter can be assessed-at least partially-by content factors contributing to the emergence of flow. Each of the content factors was characterized by specific and distinguishable brain activation patterns, encompassing reward-related midbrain structures, as well as cognitive and sensorimotor networks. The activation of sensory and motor networks in the conjunction analyses underpinned the central role of simulation for flow experience. Flow factors can be validated with functional brain imaging which can improve the understanding of human emotions and motivational processes during media entertainment.},

However, reliable and consistent findings have not been reported yet. Several methodological factors might be responsible for the discrepant findings, including the heterogeneity of patient samples in terms of symptom severity. In the current study, we combined investigations of the whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns of BPD patients with seed-based connectivity measures and then computed the correlation of connectivity measures with borderline symptom severity. Correlation-based connectivity analysis was performed on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 26 female BPD patients and 26 healthy controls. Increased intrinsic connectivity was found in clusters involving part of the caudate nucleus and the left insula in the patient group, indicating greater integration of each region. Further seed-based connectivity analyses revealed that with the caudate seed, the patient data exhibited an increased resting-state functional connectivity in the bilateral ventral striatum and the midline prefrontal regions extending to the ACC, a network associated with reward processing. The left insula seed showed significantly increased connectivity with the bilateral fronto-orbital/insula, the inferior parietal lobule and the mid-cingulate cortex, a network involved in attention and salience encoding, in the patient population. Moreover, symptom severity, as assessed with the BSL-95 outside the scanner, was negatively correlated with the coupling of the insula and the striatum in the BPD group. Overall, an increased functional connectivity within two large-scale circuitries underlying reward and salience processing was evident in patients, as compared to healthy participants. When correlated with borderline symptom severity, a reduced connectivity between key regions belonging to the reward system and salience network was observed in the patients. These findings may be helpful for facilitating further understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the BPD pathophysiology and thereby delineate potential treatment targets.},

Attention deployment (AD) and cognitive reappraisal (CR) are both efficient cognitive ER strategies, which are based on partially dissociated neural effects. Our understanding of the neural underpinnings of ER is based on laboratory paradigms that study changes of the brain activation related to isolated emotional stimuli. To track the neural response to ER in the changing and dynamic environment of daily life, we extended the common existing paradigms by applying a sequence of emotionally provocative stimuli involving three aversive images. Eighteen participants completed an ER paradigm, in which they had to either shift their attention away from the emotionally negative images by counting backwards (AD strategy) or reinterpret the meaning of stimuli (CR strategy) to attain a down-regulation of affective responses. An increased recruitment of left-sided lateral and medial PFC was shown upon regulation of negative emotions with CR as compared to AD. Remarkably, the amygdala activation showed an increasing pattern of activation during CR. The inverse relationship between PFC and amygdala was compromised during elongated blocks of reappraisal, reflecting a reduction in engagement of the top-down prefrontal regulatory circuitry upon repeated exposure to negative stimuli. These results highlight that temporal dynamic of amygdala response and its functional connectivity differentiates AD and CR strategies in regulating emotions. Findings of the current study underscore the importance of adopting temporally variant approaches for investigating the neural effects of ER. Identifying neural systems that subserve down-regulation of negative emotions is of importance in developing treatment strategies for various forms of psychopathology.},

In particular, studies indicate altered functional coupling between nodes of the language and default mode networks. Neurofeedback based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) can be used to modulate such aberrant network connectivity. We investigated resting-state connectivity changes after neurofeedback (NF) in 21 patients with schizophrenia and 35 healthy individuals. All participants underwent two days of neurofeedback training of important nodes of the left-hemispheric language network including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG). In a double-blind randomized cross-over design, participants learned to down- and up-regulate their brain activation in the designated target regions based on NF. Prior to and after each training day, a resting state measurement took place. Coupling between nodes of the language and the default mode network (DMN) selectively increased after down-as compared to up-regulation NF. Network analyses revealed more pronounced increases in functional connectivity between nodes of the language network and the DMN in patients compared to healthy individuals. In particular, down-regulation NF led to increased coupling between nodes of the language network and bilateral inferior parietal lobe (IPL) as well as posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/precuneus in patients. Up-regulation strengthened connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Improved well-being four weeks after the training predicted increased functional coupling between the left IFG and left IPL. Modulatory effects emerged as increased internetwork communication, indicating that down-regulation NF selectively enhances coupling between language and DM network nodes in patients with AVH. RtfMRI NF may thus be used to modulate brain network function that is relevant to the phenomenology of AVH. Specific effects of self-regulation on symptom improvement have to be explored in therapeutic interventions.},

Implementing information from only one electrode, however, may miss relevant information from complex electrophysiological networks. Component based analysis, in turn, depends on a priori knowledge of the signal topography. Complex designs such as studies on multisensory integration of emotions investigate subtle differences in distributed networks based on only a few trials per condition. Thus, they require a sensitive and comprehensive approach which does not rely on a-priori knowledge about the underlying neural processes. In this pilot study, feasibility and sensitivity of source localization-driven analysis for EEG-fMRI was tested using a multisensory integration paradigm. Dynamic audiovisual stimuli consisting of emotional talking faces and pseudowords with emotional prosody were rated in a delayed response task. The trials comprised affectively congruent and incongruent displays. In addition to event-locked EEG and fMRI analyses, induced oscillatory EEG responses at estimated cortical sources and in specific temporo-spectral windows were correlated with the corresponding BOLD responses. EEG analysis showed high data quality with less than 10% trial rejection. In an early time window, alpha oscillations were suppressed in bilateral occipital cortices and fMRI analysis confirmed high data quality with reliable activation in auditory, visual and frontal areas to the presentation of multisensory stimuli. In line with previous studies, we obtained reliable correlation patterns for event locked occipital alpha suppression and BOLD signal time course. Our results suggest a valid methodological approach to investigate complex stimuli using the present source localization driven method for EEG-fMRI. This novel procedure may help to investigate combined EEG-fMRI data from novel complex paradigms with high spatial and temporal resolution.},

In the intervention arm, leading ICU personnel (physicians and nurses) will be trained in ICU Support and implement the ICU Support elements into the daily work routine of their units upon completion of data collection period T0 (baseline). In the control arm, ICU Support will not be implemented until the completion of the data collection period T1 (1 month after study start). Until then, the regular daily schedule of the ICU teams will be maintained. The final data collection period (T2) will take place 4 months after the start of the study. Primary outcomes include the number of intensive care complications per patient during their ICU stay during T1 and the sick-related absence of ICU staff during T1. Secondary outcomes include, among others, the average severity of intensive care complications per patient and employee self-reported data regarding their teamwork and patient safety behaviors. The need for healthy and well-trained ICU staff is omnipresent; thus, structured and evidence-based interventions aimed at supporting ICU teams and facilitating patient safety are required. This multicenter study aims to explore the effectiveness of ICU Support for patient- and staff-centered outcomes. The insights derived from this study have the potential to significantly improve ICU patient safety, staff communication, and connectedness and decrease sickness-related expenses and social costs associated with high work demands among ICU staff.

  abstract = {A gene-environment interaction between expression genotypes of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and adverse childhood experience increases the risk of antisocial behavior. However, the neural underpinnings of this interaction remain uninvestigated. A cortico-limbic circuit involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala is central to the suppression of aggressive impulses and is modulated by serotonin (5-HT). MAOA genotypes may modulate the vulnerability of this circuit and increase the risk for emotion regulation deficits after specific life events. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) challenges 5-HT regulation and may identify vulnerable neuronal circuits, contributing to the gene-environment interaction. Functional magnetic resonance imaging measured the resting-state state activity in 64 healthy males in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Cortical maps of amygdala correlation identified the impact of ATD and its interaction with low- (MAOA-L) and high-expression variants (MAOA-H) of MAOA on cortico-limbic connectivity. Across all Regions of Interest (ROIs) exhibiting an ATD effect on cortico-limbic connectivity, MAOA-L carriers were more susceptible to ATD than MAOA-H carriers. In particular, the MAOA-L group exhibited a larger reduction of amygdala connectivity with the right prefrontal cortex and a larger increase of amygdala connectivity with the insula and dorsal PCC. MAOA-L carriers were more susceptable to a central 5-HT challenge in cortico-limbic networks. Such vulnerability of the cortical serotonergic system may contribute to the emergence of antisocial behavior after systemic challenges, observed as gene-environment interaction.

It was demonstrated that playing a video game leads to striatal dopamine release. It is unclear, however, which aspects of the game cause this reward system activation and if violent content contributes to it. We combined functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) with individual affect measures to address the neuronal correlates of violence in a video game. Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during fMRI measurement. We defined success as eliminating opponents, and failure as being eliminated themselves. Affect was measured directly before and after game play using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Failure and success events evoked increased activity in visual cortex but only failure decreased activity in orbitofrontal cortex and caudate nucleus. A negative correlation between negative affect and responses to failure was evident in the right temporal pole (rTP). The deactivation of the caudate nucleus during failure is in accordance with its role in reward-prediction error: it occurred whenever subject missed an expected reward (being eliminated rather than eliminating the opponent). We found no indication that violence events were directly rewarding for the players. We addressed subjective evaluations of affect change due to gameplay to study the reward system. Subjects reporting greater negative affect after playing the game had less rTP activity associated with failure. The rTP may therefore be involved in evaluating the failure events in a social context, to regulate the players' mood.},

Given the holistic nature of the spiral curriculum, we assumed that a purely digital model would have an impact on knowledge acquisition due to missing hands-on learning opportunities. The aim of the study was to investigate, using an emergency seminar as an example, whether purely digital training leads to a difference in theoretical knowledge compared to the traditional model. Study design: We used a two-groups design comparing a sample of medical students taught in 2020 with a purely digital teaching format (DF;  Students in the DF group scored significantly lower than students in the TF group in the final exams. Students in the DF group rated the course significantly worse than students in the TF group. The study results illustrate that purely digital education leads to inferior knowledge acquisition compared to the traditional spiral curriculum. A possible explanation may lie in a deeper processing of the information (e.g., understanding the information by experience and analysis) and accordingly a better memory recall. Moreover, the students' critical appraisal of the DF may have had an unfavorable effect on learning performance. Moderating factors may be lower learning motivation or the "zoom fatigue" effect. These study results clearly illustrate the importance of hands-on teaching for knowledge acquisition. The interlocking of theoretical knowledge and practical skills, as ensured by the spiral curriculum, is essential.},

This study investigates the differences in neural network activity during the playing of both versions of the video game. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) recorded ongoing brain activity of 18 young men playing the violence-related and the non-violence-related version of the video game Carmageddon. Image time series were decomposed into functional connectivity (FC) patterns using independent component analysis (ICA) and template-matching yielded a mapping to established functional brain networks. The FC patterns revealed a decrease in connectivity within 6 brain networks during the violence-related compared to the non-violence-related condition: three sensory-motor networks, the reward network, the default mode network (DMN), and the right-lateralized frontoparietal network. Playing violent racing games may change functional brain connectivity, in particular and even after controlling for event frequency, in the reward network and the DMN. These changes may underlie the short-term increase of aggressive affects, cognitions, and behaviors as observed after playing violent video games.},

In a large-scale pilot project 265 medical students were trained for an ICU assignment. The innovative training module was accompanied by a pre-post questionnaire for self-assessment of the skills learned. 22 weeks after the training module and still during the pandemic deployment, another questionnaire was used to evaluate experiences in deployment and the efficiency of the training module with respect to preparation for ICU deployment. The analysis revealed significant mean differences for all COVID-19-specific variables (safety dimension) in favor of the training module (n = 168). The deployment evaluation showed that the training concept was inconsistently assessed as preparation for the work deployment for 69 of the 89 deployed students in total (53% agreement/47% disagreement). The results show a good feasibility of an innovative training concept for medical students with respect to a pandemic deployment as assistants in intensive care units. The concept is suitable for providing additional helpers in intensive care units during a pandemic; however, the inconsistent evaluation indicates that the concept can be expanded and needs to be adapted.},

For educators, there are often pragmatic reasons to decide for one or another of them, such as costs, infrastructural requirements, time expenditure or qualification of the teacher. However, a central aspect to consider is the learning outcome: Does a new method achieve a similar learning success as an established standard method? To answer this question, we need an appropriate method to assess comparability of learning outcomes. In this paper, we present two essential statistical concepts that can address the issue of comparability of learning outcomes: Equivalence and non-inferiority testing. We explain the ideas behind these concepts and illustrate them with an example data set. To clarify several concepts, we use theoretical examples from one selected field: the teaching and assessment of Basic Life Support (BLS). Equivalence and non-inferiority tests can be powerful tools for comparing teaching and assessment methods. However, their correct application requires adequate knowledge about their strengths, pitfalls and application fields. The aim of this paper is to deliver this knowledge and to provide clinician researchers with a practical guidance to a successful application of these methods.},

Altered transmission of the central nervous serotonin (5-HT) contributes to dysfunctions in the cognitive control of emotions. To date, studies relating to pharmaco-fMRI challenging of the 5-HT system have focused on emotion processing for facial expressions. We investigated effects of a single-dose selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (escitalopram) on emotion regulation during virtual violence. For this purpose, 38 male participants played a violent video game during fMRI scanning. The SSRI reduced neural responses to violent actions in right-hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex encompassing the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but not to non-violent actions. Within the ACC, the drug effect differentiated areas with high inhibitory 5-HT1A receptor density (subgenual s25) from those with a lower density (pregenual p32, p24). This finding links functional responses during virtual violent actions with 5-HT neurotransmission in emotion regulation networks, underpinning the ecological validity of the 5-HT model in aggressive behavior. Available 5-HT receptor density data suggest that this SSRI effect is only observable when inhibitory and excitatory 5-HT receptors are balanced. The observed early functional changes may impact patient groups receiving SSRI treatment.},

Therefore, an Impella for venting the LV was implanted. After 6 days of mechanical circulatory support, her heart function recovered. All support could be weaned, and 2 months later, she had made a full recovery.

In this randomized controlled noninferiority trial, 251 medical undergraduates were randomly assigned to one of two interventions (QIF n = 127; VAPF n = 124). In QIF, participants received feedback from a qualified instructor. In VAPF, participants video-recorded each other while performing a wound dressing and gave each other feedback assisted by a standardized checklist. Outcome measures were participants' score in an objective structured practical examination (OSPE) and a written exam after the course. Noninferiority of VAPF (n = 123) compared to QIF (n = 127) was confirmed for both OSPE (QIF: 8.83 ± 1.30; VAPF: 8.88 ± 1.04; mean difference -0.04, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.25) and written exam (QIF: 8.99 ± 1.06; VAPF: 9.14 ± 1.05; mean difference -0.15, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.12). VAPF is a cost-efficient and viable alternative to QIF commonly used in medical education. It provides comparable training outcomes to the traditional training method with lower personnel investment. VAPF is a promising educational method for improving essential clinical competencies.},

This study aimed to examine the role of error framing in basic life support (BLS) training for future healthcare professionals.

Significant equivalence was determined for all study arms with respect to CR and self-confidence. Our study revealed that EM was not detrimental to learners' CPR performance. Given existing research on long-term beneficial effects of EM on patient safety, coupled with the proven equivalence of EM and EA concerning short-term performance, we argue that EM is a promising approach for future medical education purposes.

  abstract = {Face-to-face communication is multimodal; it encompasses spoken words, facial expressions, gaze, and co-speech gestures. In contrast to linguistic symbols (e.g., spoken words or signs in sign language) relying on mostly explicit conventions, gestures vary in their degree of conventionality. Bodily signs may have a general accepted or conventionalized meaning (e.g., a head shake) or less so (e.g., self-grooming). We hypothesized that subjective perception of conventionality in co-speech gestures relies on the classical language network, i.e., the left hemispheric inferior frontal gyrus (IFG, Broca's area) and the posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG, Wernicke's area) and studied 36 subjects watching video-recorded story retellings during a behavioral and an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. It is well documented that neural correlates of such naturalistic videos emerge as intersubject covariance (ISC) in fMRI even without involving a stimulus (model-free analysis). The subjects attended either to perceived conventionality or to a control condition (any hand movements or gesture-speech relations). Such tasks modulate ISC in contributing neural structures and thus we studied ISC changes to task demands in language networks. Indeed, the conventionality task significantly increased covariance of the button press time series and neuronal synchronization in the left IFG over the comparison with other tasks. In the left IFG, synchronous activity was observed during the conventionality task only. In contrast, the left pSTG exhibited correlated activation patterns during all conditions with an increase in the conventionality task at the trend level only. Conceivably, the left IFG can be considered a core region for the processing of perceived conventionality in co-speech gestures similar to spoken language. In general, the interpretation of conventionalized signs may rely on neural mechanisms that engage during language comprehension.},

Over the past years, a multitude of studies have addressed the question of how affective cues conveyed by auditory and visual channels are integrated. Behavioral studies show that hearing and seeing emotional expressions can support and influence each other, a notion which is supported by investigations on the underlying neurobiology. Numerous electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions subserving the integration of multimodal emotions and have provided new insights into the neural processing steps underlying the synergistic confluence of affective information from voice and face. In this paper we provide a comprehensive review covering current behavioral, electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging findings on the combination of emotions from the auditory and visual domains. Behavioral advantages arising from multimodal redundancy are paralleled by specific integration patterns on the neural level, from encoding in early sensory cortices to late cognitive evaluation in higher association areas. In summary, these findings indicate that bimodal emotions interact at multiple stages of the audiovisual integration process.},

This suggests an MAOA-L-specific neurobiological vulnerability associated with trait aggression. The neural networks underlying this vulnerability are unknown. The present study investigated genotype-specific associations between resting state brain networks and trait aggression (Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire) in 82 healthy Caucasian males. Genotype influences on aggression-related networks were studied for intrinsic and seed-based brain connectivity. Intrinsic connectivity was higher in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) of MAOA-L compared to high expressing allele (MAOA-H) carriers. Seed-based connectivity analyses revealed genotype differences in the functional involvement of this region. MAOA genotype modulated the relationship between trait aggression and VMPFC connectivity with supramarginal gyrus (SMG) and areas of the default mode network (DMN). Separate analyses for the two groups were performed to better understand how the genotype modulated the relationship between aggression and brain networks. They revealed a positive correlation between VMPFC connectivity and aggression in right angular gyrus (AG) and a negative correlation in right SMG in the MAOA-L group. No such effect emerged in the MAOA-H carriers. The results indicate a particular relevance of VMPFC for aggression in MAOA-L carriers; in specific, a detachment from the DMN along with a strengthened coupling to the AG seems to go along with lower trait aggression. MAOA-L carriers may thus depend on a synchronization of emotion regulation systems (VMPFC) with core areas of empathy (SMG) to prevent aggression.},

  abstract = {The recent expansion of studies on hypermutation may benefit from a fast and uncomplicated way to measure mutation rates. In this paper we compare different retroviral vector designs for monitoring hypermutation in vivo. Retroviral vectors combine a high transduction rate with integration at random sites within the host cell genome, thus equalizing positional effects on the reporter gene. The vectors contain a reporter gene with a premature TAG termination codon; upon reversion, a full-length fluorescent protein is expressed. Any single point mutation at the amber codon activates the reporter--except the transition from G to A, which only creates the stop codon TAA. In the construct, the reporter gene is followed by an internal ribosome entry site and a second marker that allows selection of stably transduced cells. As a reporter gene, we tested the green and yellow fluorescence proteins (GFP and YFP); and various proteins with red fluorescence (dsRed). The second marker was either a drug resistance gene, or a second fluorescent protein. We also introduced various cis-acting enhancer elements into the reporter construct, to study the simultaneous activity of enhancers on transcription and hypermutation. We found that GFP as a reporter, combined with a drug selection marker, gave the most consistent and convenient mutation rate measurements. DsRed is a good alternative to GFP, but variants with greater fluorescence intensity are needed when combined with green fluorescence measurements. We also confirm that no immunoglobulin specific sequence is needed to target hypermutation. Depending on their position in these ectopically expressed constructs, enhancers can have positive or negative effects on hypermutation.},

In particular, amygdala responsivity to negative stimuli is exaggerated while engagement of prefrontal regulatory control regions is attenuated. Successful application of emotion regulation (ER) strategies may counteract this disbalance, however, application of learned strategies in daily life is hampered in individuals afflicted by posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized that a single session of real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) guided upregulation of prefrontal regions during an emotion regulation task enhances self-control during exposure to negative stimuli and facilitates transfer of the learned ER skills to daily life. In a cross-over design, individuals with a PTSD diagnosis after a single traumatic event (n = 20) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria and individuals without a formal psychiatric diagnosis (n = 21) underwent a cognitive reappraisal training. In randomized order, all participants completed two rtfMRI neurofeedback (NF) runs targeting the left lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and two control runs without NF (NoNF) while using cognitive reappraisal to reduce their emotional response to negative scenes. During the NoNF runs, two %%-signs were displayed instead of the two-digit feedback (FB) to achieve a comparable visual stimulation. The project aimed at defining the clinical potential of the training according to three success markers: (1) NF induced changes in left lateral prefrontal cortex and bilateral amygdala activity during the regulation of aversive scenes compared to cognitive reappraisal alone (primary registered outcome), (2) associated changes on the symptomatic and behavioral level such as indicated by PTSD symptom severity and affect ratings, (3) clinical utility such as indicated by perceived efficacy, acceptance, and transfer to daily life measured four weeks after the training. In comparison to the reappraisal without feedback, a neurofeedback-specific decrease in the left lateral PFC (d = 0.54) alongside an attenuation of amygdala responses (d = 0.33) emerged. Reduced amygdala responses during NF were associated with symptom improvement (r = -0.42) and less negative affect (r = -0.63) at follow-up. The difference in symptom scores exceeds requirements for a minimal clinically important difference and corresponds to a medium effect size (d = 0.64). Importantly, 75% of individuals with PTSD used the strategies in daily life during a one-month follow-up period and perceived the training as efficient. Our findings suggest beneficial effects of the NF training indicated by reduced amygdala responses that were associated with improved symptom severity and affective state four weeks after the NF training as well as patient-centered perceived control during the training, helpfulness and application of strategies in daily life. However, reduced prefrontal involvement was unexpected. The study suggests good tolerability of the training protocol and potential for clinical use in the treatment of PTSD.},

Here, we investigated the serotonergic modulation of intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) within the DMN in healthy adult females, controlling for the menstrual cycle phase. Eighteen healthy women in the follicular phase (aged 20-31 years) participated in a double-blind controlled cross-over study of serotonin depletion. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) and a balanced amino acid load (BAL), used as the control condition, were applied on two separate days of assessment. Neural resting state data using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and individual trait impulsivity scores were obtained. ATD compared with BAL significantly reduced FC with the DMN in the precuneus (associated with self-referential thinking) and enhanced FC with the DMN in the frontal cortex (associated with cognitive reasoning). Connectivity differences with the DMN between BAL and ATD in the precentral gyrus were significantly correlated with the magnitude of serotonin depletion. Right medial frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus connectivity differences with the DMN were inversely correlated with trait impulsivity. These findings partially deviate from previous findings obtained in males and underline the importance of gender-specific studies and controlling for menstrual cycle to further elucidate the mechanism of ATD-induced changes within intrinsic thought processes.},

Disturbances of these mechanisms on multiple levels of neural processing may contribute to clinical symptoms in major depression (MD). A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was conducted to identify neurobiological foundations of altered mismatch processing in MD. Twenty-five patients with major depression and 25 matched healthy individuals completed an auditory mismatch paradigm optimized for fMRI. Brain activity during mismatch processing was compared between groups. Moreover, seed-based connectivity analyses investigated depression-specific brain networks. In patients, mismatch processing was associated with reduced activation in the right auditory cortex as well as in a fronto-parietal attention network. Moreover, functional coupling between the right auditory cortex and frontal areas was reduced in patients. Seed-to voxel analysis on the whole-brain level revealed reduced connectivity between the auditory cortex and the thalamus as well as posterior cingulate. The present study indicates deficits in sensory processing on the level of the auditory cortex in depression. Hyposensitivity in a fronto-parietal network presumably reflects altered attention mechanisms in depression. The observed impairments may contribute to psychopathology by reducing the ability of the affected individuals to orient attention toward important environmental cues.},

Thirteen male German volunteers played a first-person shooter game (Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two independent coders performed the time-based analysis of the audio-visual game content. Boredom was operationalized as interaction of prolonged absence of goal-directed behavior with lowered affect in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). A decrease of positive affect (PA) correlated with response amplitudes in bilateral insular clusters extending into the amygdala to prolonged inactive phases in a game play and an increase in negative affect (NA) was associated with higher responses in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Precuneus and hippocampus responses were negatively correlated with changes in NA. We describe for the first time neural contributions to boredom, using a video game as complex virtual environment. Further our study confirmed that PA and NA are separable constructs, reflected by distinct neural patterns. PA may be associated with afferent limbic activity whereas NA with affective control.},

We examined the effect of this task-switching requirement on chest-compression quality to gain insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying performance in standard CPR. Understanding these mechanisms can help in the development of evidence-based practical implications and cognitive aids for CPR. A total of 300 first-year medical and dentistry students (212 females, 20.2 ± 4.4 years) participated in this randomized controlled trial. They received either a CPR training comprising both chest compressions and ventilation (standard CPR) or a CPR training comprising chest compressions only (chest-compression-only CPR). Chest-compression quality (compression depth and rate) was measured via a resuscitation manikin and analyzed using linear mixed models and linear trend analyses. Overall, chest-compression quality did not differ across standard CPR and chest-compression-only CPR. However, in standard CPR, compression quality was better after ventilation than before ventilation. Importantly, ventilation impaired the quality of the compressions executed immediately after ventilation, but the quality increased with each compression after ventilation, resulting in a better chest-compression quality after ventilation than before it. This study suggests that ventilation acts as a break, improving physical capability, which in turn enhances compressions after ventilation. However, at the same time, ventilation causes a task switch which increases cognitive demands and impairs chest-compression quality immediately after ventilation. Considering the negative effect of the task-switching demand on chest-compression quality, it is useful to develop cognitive aids for professional medical care. Such cognitive aids can signal an upcoming switch to ventilation, thereby reducing the multitasking load in terms of reduced monitoring demands with respect to the number of chest compressions that have already been executed.},

In particular, prefrontal regions have been postulated to control amygdala activity by inhibitory projections, and this process may be disrupted in aggressive individuals. The atypical antipsychotic quetiapine successfully attenuates aggressive behavior in various disorders; the underlying neural processes, however, are unknown. A strengthened functional coupling in the prefrontal-amygdala system may account for these anti-aggressive effects. An inhibition of this network has been reported for virtual aggression in violent video games as well. However, there have been so far no in-vivo observations of pharmacological influences on corticolimbic projections during human aggressive behavior. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, quetiapine and placebo were administered for three successive days prior to an fMRI experiment. In this experiment, functional brain connectivity was assessed during virtual aggressive behavior in a violent video game and an aggression-free control task in a non-violent modification. Quetiapine increased the functional connectivity of ACC and DLPFC with the amygdala during virtual aggression, whereas OFC-amygdala coupling was attenuated. These effects were observed neither for placebo nor for the non-violent control. These results demonstrate for the first time a pharmacological modification of aggression-related human brain networks in a naturalistic setting. The violence-specific modulation of prefrontal-amygdala networks appears to control aggressive behavior and provides a neurobiological model for the anti-aggressive effects of quetiapine.},

A validated inventory (state-trait operation anxiety-state) was used to assess perioperative state anxiety before (T1) and after (T2) surgery. In addition, trait operation anxiety was evaluated with an additional validated inventory (state-trait operation anxiety-trait). Moreover, user ratings on the usefulness of VORT were assessed with an evaluation questionnaire. Study arms were compared for perioperative state anxiety with two-tailed independent samples t tests. Subjective ratings were correlated with STOA-Trait values to investigate possible associations between perioperative anxiety with perceived usefulness. There were no significant differences in perioperative state anxiety between VORT and standard operation preparation procedures before and after the surgery. Nonetheless, patients' ratings of VORT overall were positive. The tour was perceived as useful and, therefore, showed acceptance for VR use. These ratings were unrelated to the degree of perioperative anxiety. The subjective benefit of VORT could not be explained by a reduction of perioperative anxiety. Instead, VORT appears to serve the need for information and reduce uncertainty. In addition, VORT is perceived as beneficial regardless of the age of the patients. Considering this effect and the manageable organizational and financial effort toward implementation, the general use of VORT can be recommended.

Three hours after challenge intake (ATD or a balanced control condition, BAL), resting state fMRI scans were obtained. In patients, ATD led to attenuated FC of the right superior premotor cortex (BA 6) with the DMN, comparable to the extent found in controls after BAL administration. ATD lowered FC of the left somatosensory cortex (BA 3) with the DMN, independently of the factor group, but with stronger effects in controls. Data reveal a serotonergic modulation of FC between BA 6 and 3, known to be relevant for motor planning and sensory perception, and the DMN, thereby possibly pointing toward ATD acting beneficially on neural planning of motor activity in patients with ADHD.},

  abstract = {Virtual environments (VEs), in the recent years, have become more prevalent in neuroscience. These VEs can offer great flexibility, replicability, and control over the presented stimuli in an immersive setting. With recent developments, it has become feasible to achieve higher-quality visuals and VEs at a reasonable investment. Our aim in this project was to develop and implement a novel real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI)-based neurofeedback (NF) training paradigm, taking into account new technological advances that allow us to integrate complex stimuli into a visually updated and engaging VE. We built upon and developed a first-person shooter in which the dynamic change of the VE was the feedback variable in the brain-computer interface (BCI). We designed a study to assess the feasibility of the BCI in creating an immersive VE for NF training. In a randomized single-blinded fMRI-based NF-training session, 24 participants were randomly allocated into one of two groups: active and reduced contingency NF. All participants completed three runs of the shooter-game VE lasting 10 min each. Brain activity in a supplementary motor area region of interest regulated the possible movement speed of the player's avatar and thus increased the reward probability. The gaming performance revealed that the participants were able to actively engage in game tasks and improve across sessions. All 24 participants reported being able to successfully employ NF strategies during the training while performing in-game tasks with significantly higher perceived NF control ratings in the NF group. Spectral analysis showed significant differential effects on brain activity between the groups. Connectivity analysis revealed significant differences, showing a lowered connectivity in the NF group compared to the reduced contingency-NF group. The self-assessment manikin ratings showed an increase in arousal in both groups but failed significance. Arousal has been linked to presence, or feelings of immersion, supporting the VE's objective. Long paradigms, such as NF in MRI settings, can lead to mental fatigue; therefore, VEs can help overcome such limitations. The rewarding achievements from gaming targets can lead to implicit learning of self-regulation and may broaden the scope of NF applications.},

In such circumstances, video-assisted guidance by the dispatcher has been demonstrated to be advantageous for the recognition of cardiac arrest and the improvement of CPR quality. The present study investigates the effectiveness of a brief training program for control center dispatchers in the recognition of common errors during simulated resuscitation. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and registered at the German Clinical Trial Register on 27th of February 2024 (Registration number: DRKS00032661) prior to inclusion of the first participant. Within a two-armed group study design, paramedics and emergency physicians were randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 44) or a control group (n = 44). The experimental group was initially exposed to a targeted brief training aimed at enhancing the recognition of excessively deep chest compression depth. All participants evaluated 42 distinct video sequences showing seven typical errors during CPR. The shown CPRs were simulated on a training manikin and the videos were evaluated by the participants under laboratory conditions. The primary endpoint was the accurate evaluation of the presented videos with too deep compression depth in a laboratory setting. A total of 3696 video sequences were evaluated. The experimental group demonstrated a significantly higher recognition rate for too deep chest compressions compared to the control group (87.9% vs. 59.2%, p < 0.001). With regard to the remaining errors, no significant differences were observed between the study groups. Overall, 2861 of the 3696 videos (77.7%) were correctly classified. The proportion of correctly classified videos was significantly higher in the experimental group compared to the control group (79.8% vs. 75.6%, p = 0.003), indicating a statistically significant effect of the intervention. The identification of chest compressions with too deep compression depth in a video of simulated CPR was found to increase significantly in evaluators who had undergone a brief training course. The trial was registered in the German Clinical Trial Register "BfArM - Deutsches Register Klinischer Studien (DRKS)" under the registration number DRKS00032661.},

Possible explanations may be obsolescence and/or a shift in needs. We investigated whether overarching topics and specific learning objectives of the WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide are still up-to-date, their attributed importance, and their perceived difficulty to achieve. Experts on patient safety and medical education from 3 European countries were asked to suggest learning objectives concerning patient safety using group concept mapping. Following 3 successive steps, experts rated ideas by importance and difficulty to achieve. Correlation analyses investigated the relationship between those. Overarching topics of the learning goals (clusters) were identified with multivariate analysis. A total of 119 statements about intended learning objectives on patient safety were generated, of which 86 remained for sorting and rating. Based on multivariate analyses, 10 overarching topics (clusters) emerged. Both the learning objectives and the overarching topics showed high correspondence with the WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide. Strong correlations emerged between importance and difficulty ratings for learning objectives and overarching topics. The WHO Patient Safety Curriculum Guide's learning goals are still relevant and up-to-date. Remarkably, learning objectives categorized as highly important are also perceived as difficult to achieve. In summary, the insufficient implementation in medical curricula cannot be attributed to the content of the learning goals. The future focus should be on how the WHO learning goals can be implemented in existing curricular courses.},

However, the question whether perceptual integration of facial and vocal emotions takes place in primary sensory areas, multimodal cortices, or in affective structures remains unanswered yet. Using novel computer-generated stimuli, we combined emotional faces and voices in congruent and incongruent ways and assessed functional brain data (fMRI) during an emotional classification task. Both congruent and incongruent audiovisual stimuli evoked larger responses in thalamus and superior temporal regions compared with unimodal conditions. Congruent emotions were characterized by activation in amygdala, insula, ventral posterior cingulate (vPCC), temporo-occipital, and auditory cortices; incongruent emotions activated a frontoparietal network and bilateral caudate nucleus, indicating a greater processing load in working memory and emotion-encoding areas. The vPCC alone exhibited differential reactions to congruency and incongruency for all emotion categories and can thus be considered a central structure for supramodal representation of complex emotional information. Moreover, the left amygdala reflected supramodal representation of happy stimuli. These findings document that emotional information does not merge at the perceptual audiovisual integration level in unimodal or multimodal areas, but in vPCC and amygdala.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was measured in fifteen right-handed males while playing the video game Carmageddon. Neuroimaging data were analyzed based on violent and non-violent success and failure events. Correlations with subjective game experience measured brain-behavior and -affect relationships. Results revealed a differential involvement of the striatal reward system: non-violent success elicited activation of the ventral striatum, whereas violent success activated specifically the dorsal striatum. Subjective game experience correlated with putamen and medial prefrontal cortex activation specifically for violent success. These results emphasize a differential neural processing of violent and non-violent success events in dorsal and ventral striatum. Virtual violence seems to enable selective responses of the reward system and positive in-game experience.},

Typical problems arising from either low or exaggerated interspecific morphological differentiation are best met by automated methods of machine learning that learn efficient and effective species identification from training samples. However, limited infraspecific sampling remains a key challenge also in machine learning. In this study, we assessed whether a data augmentation approach may help to overcome the problem of scarce training data in automated visual species identification. The stepwise augmentation of data comprised image rotation as well as visual and virtual augmentation. The visual data augmentation applies classic approaches of data augmentation and generation of artificial images using a generative adversarial networks approach. Descriptive feature vectors are derived from bottleneck features of a VGG-16 convolutional neural network that are then stepwise reduced in dimensionality using Global Average Pooling and principal component analysis to prevent overfitting. Finally, data augmentation employs synthetic additional sampling in feature space by an oversampling algorithm in vector space. Applied on four different image data sets, which include scarab beetle genitalia (Pleophylla, Schizonycha) as well as wing patterns of bees (Osmia) and cattleheart butterflies (Parides), our augmentation approach outperformed a deep learning baseline approach by means of resulting identification accuracy with nonaugmented data as well as a traditional 2D morphometric approach (Procrustes analysis of scarab beetle genitalia).

Important top-down influences are attentional focus and supramodal social memory representations. The present study investigated the neural networks underlying these top-down processes and their role in social stimulus classification. In a neuroimaging study with 45 healthy participants, we employed a social adaptation of the Implicit Association Test. Attentional focus was modified via the classification task, which compared two domains of social perception (emotion and gender), using the exactly same stimulus set. Supramodal memory representations were addressed via congruency of the target categories for the classification of auditory and visual social stimuli (voices and faces). Functional magnetic resonance imaging identified attention-specific and supramodal networks. Emotion classification networks included bilateral anterior insula, pre-supplementary motor area, and right inferior frontal gyrus. They were pure attention-driven and independent from stimulus modality or congruency of the target concepts. No neural contribution of supramodal memory representations could be revealed for emotion classification. In contrast, gender classification relied on supramodal memory representations in rostral anterior cingulate and ventromedial prefrontal cortices. In summary, different domains of social perception involve different top-down processes which take place in clearly distinguishable neural networks.},

Unique challenges faced by healthcare facilities in border regions render them particularly vulnerable during crises, emphasizing the need to promote resilience in these areas. The current study evaluated the state and needs of resilience in healthcare professionals in a representative European border region. All hospitals and emergency medical care services in the Euregio Meuse-Rhine (Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands) were approached to participate via an online-survey. Behavioral data on psychological distress (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), work-related stressors, individual resilience (Brief Resilience Scale, Resilience at Work scale), and organizational resilience (Benchmark Resilience Tool-short) were collected. 2233 participants initiated the survey with 500 responses included in the analysis. 46% of the participants indicated clinically significant psychological distress. Most challenging stressors were staff availability, available time, and workload. On average, individual resilience was in the normal range, yet 15.6% showed below average resilience. At the organizational level, healthcare institutions can particularly enhance resilience in the domains of Internal resources, Situation Awareness, and Unity of purpose. Compared to their neighbor countries, German healthcare professionals indicated higher levels of depressive symptoms, were more burdened by work-related stressors, and reported lower levels of organizational resilience. Findings highlight that healthcare institutions not only need to promote the resilience of the individual employee particularly in border regions, healthcare institutions, must also act to be better prepared for potential threats and crises while considering each country's unique needs.},

The limited availability of highly qualified instructors and tight economic conditions complicates the delivery of these life-saving trainings. Consequently, innovative and resource-efficient approaches are needed to minimize or eliminate contagion while maintaining high training standards and managing learner anxiety related to infection risk. In a non-inferiority trial 346 first-year medical, dentistry, and physiotherapy students underwent BLS training at AIXTRA-Competence Center for Training and Patient Safety at the University Hospital RWTH Aachen. Our objectives were (1) to examine whether peer feedback BLS training supported by tele-instructors matches the learning performance of standard instructor-guided BLS training for laypersons; and (2) to minimize infection risk during BLS training. Therefore, in a parallel group design, we compared arm (1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) BLS training (Historical control group of 2019) with arm (2) a Tele-Instructor Supported Peer-Feedback (TPF) BLS training (Intervention group of 2020). Both study arms were based on Peyton's 4-step approach. Before and after each training session, objective data for BLS performance (compression depth and rate) were recorded using a resuscitation manikin. We also assessed overall BLS performance via standardized instructor evaluation and student self-reports of confidence via questionnaire. Non-inferiority margins for the outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with SIF. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority. The results confirmed non-inferiority of TPF to SIF for all tested outcome parameters. A follow-up after 2 weeks found no confirmed COVID-19 infections among the participants. Tele-instructor supported peer feedback is a powerful alternative to in-person instructor feedback on BLS skills during a pandemic, where infection risk needs to be minimized while maximizing the quality of BLS skill learning. https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00025199, Trial ID: DRKS00025199.},

Neurofeedback (NF) seems a promising method to address the neural dysfunctions underlying those cognitive impairments. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a central hub for cognitive processing, is one of the brain regions known to be dysfunctional in schizophrenia. Here we conducted NF training based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in patients with schizophrenia to enable them to control their ACC activity. Training was performed over 3 days in a group of 11 patients with schizophrenia and 11 healthy controls. Social feedback was provided in accordance with the evoked activity in the selected region of interest (ROI). Neural and cognitive strategies were examined off-line. Both groups learned to control the activity of their ACC but used different neural strategies: patients activated the dorsal and healthy controls the rostral subdivision. Patients mainly used imagination of music to elicit activity and the control group imagination of sports. In a stepwise regression analysis, the difference in neural control did not result from the differences in cognitive strategies but from diagnosis alone. Based on social reinforcers, patients with schizophrenia can learn to regulate localized brain activity. However, cognitive strategies and neural network location differ from healthy controls. These data emphasize that for therapeutic interventions in patients with schizophrenia compensatory strategies may emerge. Specific cognitive skills or specific dysfunctional networks should be addressed to train impaired skills. Social NF based on fMRI may be one method to accomplish precise learning targets.},

  abstract = {Practical skills training is an essential part of medical education. An important example is the training of Basic Life Support (BLS) skills, which are key to improve patient outcomes in life-threatening situations. However, despite practical training, BLS performance is often sub-optimal even among healthcare professionals and medical students. Finding more effective training methods is therefore of high importance. A promising method to enhance learning outcomes is reflective practice. The goal of the present study was to evaluate whether a short reflective practice intervention following standard BLS training (Peyton's 4-step approach) improves BLS training outcomes, reflected in higher BLS performance and higher self-confidence to perform BLS. 287 first-year medical students were randomly assigned to one of two BLS training conditions: 1) standard BLS training (ST), 2) ST followed by a 15-minute reflective practice exercise. Outcome parameters included objective BLS performance data assessed by a resuscitation manikin, and students' self-reported confidence in their BLS skills. Outcomes were assessed directly after the training (T0) and re-assessed one week later (T1). A two-way mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effect of the intervention on BLS performance and self-reported confidence. Significance was determined by two-sided 95% confidence intervals. The intervention group performed significantly more effective compressions at T1 and began significantly faster with performing their first chest compression at T0 and T1, in comparison to the control group. No significant differences between study groups regarding their self-reported confidence to perform BLS were observed. This research shows that standard BLS training accompanied with a simple, cost-effective reflective practice exercise can improve learners' BLS skill acquisition and retention. This shows that reflective practice has the potential to enhance practical skills training in medicine; yet, more empirical studies are needed to examine its broader applicability.},

The aim of this retrospective study was to characterize the consultation requests of the ICU to the PC consultation team as well as the patients by a description of trajectories and interventions. Retrospective analysis of all patients receiving intensive care at RWTH Aachen University Hospital in 2019 for whom a PC consultation was requested. The patient population transferred from the ICU to the PC ward was compared with the non-transferred population. In each case, the primary consultation was evaluated regarding the following factors: question, vigilance, length of time from consultation request to its performance, and primary focus of the question. The question focus was categorized into "symptom control", "counselling" and "transfer" (tick options). In addition, a free text field was available for further notes. Exploration of diagnoses was complemented by accessing the electronic health records. A total of 102 consultation requests from the ICU to the PC ward were evaluated. The morbidity of patients was high, and most patients had at least one of the following diagnoses: pulmonary (62%), cardiovascular (61%), and/or neurological disease (55%). Of the patients 32 (31%) were transferred to the PC ward, among whom weakness (94%), fatigue (77%), anxiety (55%), pain (53%), and dyspnea (48%) were the most frequently noted symptoms.

In total, 35 (34%) of all patients who were seen by palliative care specialists on ICUs in 2019 could be discharged alive. The most frequent reasons for nonadmission were lack of capacity of the PC ward (33%), dying while being on the waiting list (20%), and refusal by the patient (20%). Of the patients, 7 (26%) died within 48 h after they had been transferred to the PC ward.

  abstract = {Training Basic Life Support saves lives. However, current BLS training approaches are time-consuming and costly. Alternative cost-efficient and effective training methods are highly needed. The present study evaluated whether a video-feedback supported peer-guided Basic Life Support training approach achieves similar practical performance as a standard instructor-guided training in laypersons. In a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial, 288 first-year medical students were randomized to two study arms with different Basic Life Support training methods: 1) Standard Instructor Feedback (SIF) or 2) a Peer Video Feedback (PVF). Outcome parameters were objective data for Basic Life Support performance (compression depth and rate) from a resuscitation manikin with recording software as well as overall Basic Life Support performance and subjective confidence. Non-inferiority margins (Δ) for these outcome parameters and sample size calculation were based on previous studies with Standard Instructor Feedback. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals were employed to determine significance of non-inferiority. Results confirmed non-inferiority of Peer Video Feedback to Standard Instructor Feedback for compression depth (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 2.9%; 95% CI: -8.2% to 14.1%; Δ = -19%), overall Basic Life Support performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = 6.7%; 95% CI: 0.0% to 14.3%; Δ = -27%) and subjective confidence for CPR performance (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.01; 95% CI: -0.18-0.17; Δ = -0.5) and emergency situations (proportion difference PVF-SIF = -0.02; 95% CI: -0.21-0.18; Δ = -0.5). Results for compression rate were inconclusive. Peer Video Feedback achieves comparable results as standard instructor-based training methods. It is an easy-to-apply and cost-efficient alternative to standard Basic Life Support training methods. To improve performance with respect to compression rate, additional implementation of a metronome is recommended.},

  abstract = {Diminished synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) has been linked to disrupted impulse control in aversive contexts. However, the neural correlates underlying a serotonergic modulation of female impulsivity remain unclear. The present study investigated punishment-induced inhibition in healthy young women. Eighteen healthy female subjects (aged 20-31) participated in a double-blinded, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, within subjects, repeated measures study. They were assessed on two randomly assigned occasions that were controlled for menstrual cycle phase. In a randomized order, one day, acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) was used to reduce 5-HT synthesis in the brain. On the other day, participants received a tryptophan-balanced amino acid load (BAL) as a control condition. Three hours after administration of ATD/BAL, neural activity was recorded during a modified Go/No-Go task implementing reward or punishment processes using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neural activation during No-Go trials in punishment conditions after BAL versus ATD administration correlated positively with the magnitude of central 5-HT depletion in the ventral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). Furthermore, neural activation in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC) and the dorsal ACC correlated positively with trait impulsivity. The results indicate reduced neural sensitivity to punishment after short-term depletion of 5-HT in brain areas related to emotion regulation (subgenual ACC) increasing with depletion magnitude and in brain areas related to appraisal and expression of emotions (mOFC and dorsal ACC), increasing with trait impulsivity. This suggests a serotonergic modulation of neural circuits related to emotion regulation, impulsive behavior, and punishment processing in females.},

To present the results of the long-term follow-up of a cohort of patients with JEB-H, and to provide guidelines for prognosis, treatment and care. All patients with JEB-H included in the Dutch Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) Registry between 1988 and 2011 were followed longitudinally by our EB team. Diagnosis was established using immunofluorescence antigen mapping, electron microscopy and DNA analysis. In total, we included 22 patients with JEB-H over a 23-year period. Their average age at death was 5.8 months (range 0.5-32.6 months). The causes of death were, in order of frequency: failure to thrive, respiratory failure, pneumonia, dehydration, anaemia, sepsis and euthanasia. The pattern of initial weight gain was a predictor of lifespan in these patients. Invasive treatments to extend life did not promote survival in our patients. It is important to diagnose JEB-H as soon as possible after birth so that the management can be shifted from life-saving to comfort care. The palliative end-of-life care can take place in hospital, but is also safe in the home setting. Suffering in patients with JEB-H can become so unbearable that in some patients who do not respond to adequate analgesic and sedative treatment, newborn euthanasia, performed according to the Groningen protocol, is legally permitted in the Netherlands.},

Each patient received an initial dose (ID) of either vecuronium (V) or ORG 9487 (O) followed by maintenance doses (MDn) of either V or O (ID/MD: O/O, V/O, O/V, and V/V). The time course of action was measured mechanomyographically, determining the duration until 25% recovery of the single twitch (DUR25). The onset time of an ID of ORG 9487 was shorter than that of an ID of vecuronium (96 vs 203 sec, P < 0.001). The DUR25 of the ID of ORG 9487 was less than half that of vecuronium (10.7 +/- 2.8 vs 28.8 +/- 6.1 min, P < 0.001). The DUR25 of MD1 and MD2 of ORG 9487 were shorter than those of vecuronium (O/O: 7.3 +/- 2.8 and 8.5 +/- 2.4 min; V/O: 12.7 +/- 3.3 and 11.5 +/- 3.5 min, vs O/V: 16.4 +/- 4.5 and 20.6 +/- 4.7 min; V/V: 18.8 +/- 3.0 and 20.1 +/- 3.8 min, respectively, P < 0.05). AN ID of vecuronium prolonged the DUR25 of MD1 and MD2 of ORG 9487 (P < 0.05). ORG 9487 is a muscle relaxant with a shorter duration of action than vecuronium.

Retrospective cohort study. The study was performed at the University Medical Centre Groningen in the 4 years between 1 January 2010 and the 31 December 2013. Complications and their severity were graded according to the standard complication score (20 items) of the Dutch Society of Anaesthesia. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for the reported complications. A total of 81 267 anaesthetic cases were included. In the paediatric cohort, there were 410 (2.9%) complications and 1675 (2.5%) in the adults. In both cohorts age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists classification and emergency treatment were independent risk factors for complications. With respect to age, infants less than 1 year were at the highest risk, whereas in the adult cohort, increased age was related to a greater number of complications. The incidences of the specific complications were different between both cohorts. Upper airway obstruction was more frequently observed in paediatric patients (26%), whereas in the adults, complications with the highest incidence concerned conversion of regional-to-general anaesthesia (25%) and hypotension (17%). Risk factors for all peri-operative complications were similar for paediatric and adult anaesthesia. However, the incidence of specific complications differed between both age categories.},

After 3 days, the epidural analgesia was stopped and the patient regained her preoperative motor function within 5 h.

Nevertheless, it is frequently prescribed to pediatric patients as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia or for procedural sedation. There is ample literature on the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine in this vulnerable patient population, but there is a general lack of consensus on dosing. In this project, we aimed to use the standardized workflow of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary to establish best evidence-based pediatric dosing guidelines for dexmedetomidine as premedication and for procedural sedation. The available literature on dexmedetomidine in pediatrics was reviewed in order to address the following three questions: (1) What is the right dose? (2) What is known about efficacy? (3) What is known about safety? Relevant literature was compiled into a risk-benefit analysis document. A team of clinical experts critically appraised the analysis and the proposed dosing recommendations. Dexmedetomidine is most commonly administered via the intravenous or intranasal route. Clearance is age dependent, warranting higher doses in infants to reach similar exposure as in adults. Dexmedetomidine use results in satisfactory sedation at parent separation, adequate sedation and a favorable recovery profile. The safety profile is good and comparable to adults, with dose-related hemodynamic effects. Following the structured approach of the Dutch Pediatric Formulary, best evidence-based dosing recommendations were proposed for dexmedetomidine, used as premedication prior to induction of anesthesia (intranasal dose) and for procedural sedation (intranasal and intravenous dose) in pediatric patients.},

CHDs were distributed equally in patients with mild or severe CARMs. Patients with multiple congenital abnormalities were more frequently diagnosed with CHD (n = 16, 36%) than patients without multiple congenital malformations (n = 5, 9%, P = .001). Patients with CARM diagnosed with CHD using pediatric cardiac echo screening were younger than 3 months of age at diagnosis. Earlier general pediatric examinations missed 7 (50%) children with mild and 4 (50%) with severe CHDs. The severity of CARM could predict neither prevalence nor severity of CHD. More than one-half of CHDs were missed during the first physical examination. No new CHDs were found in patients older than 3 months of age at the time CARMs were diagnosed. We recommend screening all patients with CARM younger than 3 months of age for CHD at the time CARM is diagnosed.

A mixed methods approach was used, consisting of information retrieved from medical records on prescribed pain medication from Ghana and Benin, and semi-structured interviews with health care personnel (HCP) from Ghana on pain perceptions, assessment and treatment. Medical records (n = 149) of patients treated between 2008 and 2012 were collected between November 2012 and August 2013. Interviews (n = 11) were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and qualitatively analyzed. In 113 (84%) of the 135 included records, pain medication, mostly simple analgesics, was prescribed. In 48% of the prescriptions, an indication was not documented. HCP reported that advanced BU could be painful, especially after wound care and after a skin graft. They reported not be trained in the assessment of mild pain. Pain recognition was perceived as difficult, as patients were said to suppress or to exaggerate pain, and to have different expectations regarding acceptable pain levels. HCP reported a fear of side effects of pain medication, shortage and irregularities in the supply of pain medication, and time constraints among medical doctors for pain management. Professionals perceived BU disease as potentially painful, and predominantly focused on severe pain. Our study suggests that pain in BU deserves attention and should be integrated in current treatment.},

From this perspective, prehabilitation-a proactive, multimodal approach to enhance patients' functional, nutritional, and psychological status prior to surgery-has gained attention as a potential contributor to value-based, personalized care. This study aims to synthesize mechanistic rationale, clinical evidence, and system-level considerations for prehabilitation, with particular focus on allostatic capacity and the body's response to surgical stress. Current evidence shows that prehabilitation may reduce postoperative complications, shorten hospital stays, and improve functional recovery, particularly when interventions are multimodal. However, the existing literature is characterized by methodological heterogeneity and variable quality, seemingly limiting generalizability and large-scale implementation. Further research is required to standardize outcome measures, identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit, and evaluate cost-effectiveness. Integration of prehabilitation into perioperative care pathways will depend on improved mechanistic understanding, robust clinical trials, and alignment with broader health policy and system-level initiatives. Prehabilitation may represent a meaningful step toward value-based and sustainable surgical care, though its implementation must be guided by high-quality evidence and careful consideration of context-specific factors.},

Furthermore, we investigated the anti-inflammatory properties of ARA290. Twenty-six male Lewis/HanHsd rats were exposed to unilateral ischemia for 30 minutes, with subsequent removal of the contralateral kidney. Post-reperfusion, ARA290 was administered early (one hour), late (four hours) or repetitive (one and four hours). Saline was used as vehicle treatment. Rats were sacrificed after three days. Early ARA290 treatment improved renal function. Late- or repetitive treatment tended to improve clinical markers. Furthermore, early ARA290 treatment reduced renal inflammation and acute kidney injury at three days post-reperfusion. Late- or repetitive treatment did not affect inflammation or acute kidney injury. ARA290 attenuated renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. This study showed the anti-inflammatory effect of ARA290 and suggests early administration in the post-reperfusional phase is most effective.

This randomised, double-blinded trial evaluated the effect of RIC on kidney graft outcome in the first year, and examined the predictive value of a new measure of initial kidney graft function, i.e. the estimated time to a 50% reduction in plasma creatinine post-transplantation (tCr50). A total of 225 patients undergoing deceased donor kidney transplantation were randomised to RIC or a sham procedure performed prior to kidney reperfusion. Up to four repetitive cycles of five minutes of leg ischaemia and five minutes of reperfusion were given. GFR, plasma creatinine, cystatin C and neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured at three and twelve months and estimated GFR was calculated using four different equations. Other secondary outcomes were identified from patient files. RIC did not affect GFR or other outcomes when compared to the sham procedure at three or twelve months. tCr50 correlated with one year graft function (p<0.0001 for both mGFR and eGFR estimates). In contrast, DGF i.e. "need of dialysis the first week" did not correlate significantly with one year GFR. RIC during deceased donor kidney transplantation did not improve one year outcome.

This study aimed to establish a stable and reproducible porcine kidney NMP model incorporating sevoflurane delivery. Different administration techniques and oxygenator setups were evaluated to identify the most effective method of sevoflurane application. Administering sevoflurane directly as a liquid into the perfusate resulted in excessive gas formation and unstable drug concentrations. In contrast, using a vaporizer connected to an Inspire 8F M oxygenator allowed for stable and reproducible sevoflurane levels over a 90-min perfusion period, while maintaining sufficient oxygenation. This method proved to be a reliable approach for sevoflurane delivery in kidney NMP. However, oxygenators exposed to sevoflurane should not be reused due to the risk of membrane damage. These findings support the feasibility of using sevoflurane in kidney NMP and provide a platform for further investigation into its potential to improve renal graft outcomes.},

  abstract = {Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are among the most commonly administered drugs in the perioperative period due to their prominent role in pain management. However, they potentially have perioperative consequences due to immune-modulating effects through the inhibition of prostanoid synthesis, thereby affecting the levels of various cytokines. These effects may have a direct impact on the postoperative outcome of patients since the immune system aims to restore homeostasis and plays an indispensable role in regeneration and repair. By affecting the immune response, consequences can be expected on various organ systems. This narrative review aims to highlight these potential immune system-related consequences, which include systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, immediate and persistent postoperative pain, effects on oncological and neurologic outcome, and wound, anastomotic, and bone healing.},

Experimental evidence indicates that remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) provides systemic protection against ischaemia-reperfusion injury in various tissues. 'Remote ischaemic conditioning in renal transplantation--effect on immediate and extended kidney graft function' (the CONTEXT study) is an investigator initiated, multicentre, randomised controlled trial investigating whether RIC of the leg of the recipient improves short and long-term graft function following deceased donor kidney transplantation. The study will include 200 kidney transplant recipients of organ donation after brain death and 20 kidney transplant recipients of organ donation after circulatory death. Participants are randomised in a 1:1 design to RIC or sham-RIC (control). RIC consists of four cycles of 5 min occlusion of the thigh by a tourniquet inflated to 250 mm Hg, separated by 5 min of deflation. Primary end point is the time to a 50% reduction from the baseline plasma creatinine, estimated from the changes of plasma creatinine values 30 days post-transplant or 30 days after the last performed dialysis post-transplant. Secondary end points are: need of dialysis post-transplant, measured and estimated-glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 3 and 12 months after transplantation, patient and renal graft survival, number of rejection episodes in the first year, and changes in biomarkers of acute kidney injury and inflammation in plasma, urine and graft tissue. The study is approved by the local ethical committees and national data security agencies. Results are expected to be published in 2016. NCT01395719.},

To study its dynamics in kidney transplant recipients (KTR), we determined whether the degree of frailty and its domains are affected by kidney transplantation (KT). Between 2015 and 2017, 176 KTR were included. Frailty scores were measured using the Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI), assessed preoperatively and during follow-up. Transitions in frailty state and changes in the individual domains were determined. Mean age (±SD) was 51.8 (± 14.1) years, and 63.1% of KTR were male. Thirty patients were considered frail (GFI ≥ 4) at baseline. After a mean follow-up of 22.8 ± 8.3 months, 34 non-frail patients (19.3%) became frail, 125 patients (71.0%) remained the same, and 17 frail patients (9.7%) became non-frail (GFI < 4). In the domain psychosocial functioning, 28.4% of the patients had an increase in GFI score after follow-up. Patients who scored a point in the domain cognition at baseline had a greater chance of becoming frail (OR 4.38, 95% CI 0.59-32.24). In conclusion, almost one-fifth of non-frail KTR transitioned to a frail state after their transplantation. These results could be used to predict the impact of KT on frailty course and help with implementing prehabilitation for patients at risk.},

One of these processes is associated with the phenomenon of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. Anaesthetic conditioning is a widely described strategy to attenuate ischaemia-reperfusion injury. We therefore conducted the Volatile Anaesthetic Protection of Renal Transplants-1 trial, a pilot project evaluating the influence of two anaesthetic regimens, propofol- vs sevoflurane-based anaesthesia, on biochemical and clinical outcomes in living donor kidney transplantation. Sixty couples were randomly assigned to the following three groups: PROP (donor and recipient propofol), SEVO (donor and recipient sevoflurane), and PROSE (donor propofol and recipient sevoflurane). The primary outcome was renal injury reflected by urinary biomarkers. The follow-up period was 2 yr. Three couples were excluded, leaving 57 couples for analysis. Concentrations of kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), N -acetyl-β- d -glucosaminidase (NAG), and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) in the first urine upon reperfusion showed no differences. On day 2, KIM-1 concentrations were higher in SEVO [952.8 (interquartile range 311.8-1893.0) pg mmol -1 ] compared with PROP [301.2 (202.0-504.7) pg mmol -1 ]. This was the same for NAG: SEVO, 1.835 (1.162-2.457) IU mmol -1 vs PROP, 1.078 (0.819-1.713) IU mmol -1 . Concentrations of H-FABP showed no differences. Measured glomerular filtration rate at 3, 6, and 12 months showed no difference. After 2 yr, there was a difference in the acute rejection rate ( P =0.039). Post hoc testing revealed a difference between PROP (35%) and PROSE (5%; P =0.020). The difference between PROP and SEVO (11%) was not significant ( P =0.110). The SEVO group showed higher urinary KIM-1 and NAG concentrations in living donor kidney transplantation on the second day after transplantation. This was not reflected in inferior graft outcome.

In our centre, patients transplanted preemptively are considered at increased risk of renal graft thrombosis compared to patients who are dialysis-dependent at time of transplantation. Therefore these patients are given a single dose of 5000 IU unfractionated heparin intraoperatively before clamping of the vessels. We questioned whether there is a difference in haemostatic state between preemptively and non-preemptively transplanted patients and whether the distinction in intraoperative heparin administration used in our center is justified. For this analysis, citrate samples of patients participating in the VAPOR-1 trial were used and several haemostatic and fibrinolytic parameters were measured in 29 preemptively and 28 non-preemptively transplanted patients and compared to 37 living kidney donors. Sample points were: induction anaesthesia (T1), 5 minutes after reperfusion (T2) and 2 hours postoperative (T3). At T1, recipient groups showed comparable elevated levels of platelet factor 4 (PF4, indicating platelet activation), prothrombin fragment F1+2 and D-dimer (indicating coagulation activation) and Von Willebrand Factor (indicating endothelial activation) compared to the donors. The Clot Lysis Time (CLT, a measure of fibrinolytic potential) was prolonged in both recipient groups compared to the donors. At T3, F1+2, PF4 and CLT were higher in non-preemptively transplanted recipients compared to preemptively transplanted recipients. Compared to donors, non-preemptive recipients showed a prolonged CLT, but comparable levels of PF4 and D-dimer. In conclusion pre-transplantation, preemptively and non-preemptively transplanted patients show a comparable enhanced haemostatic state. A distinction in intraoperative heparin administration between preemptive and non-preemptive transplantation does not seem justified.},

Reperfusion takes place in the recipient and most of the injury following ischemia and reperfusion occurs during this reperfusion phase; therefore, the intra-operative period seems an attractive window of opportunity to modulate IRI and improve short- and potentially long-term graft outcome. Commonly used volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane and isoflurane have been shown to interfere with many of the pathophysiological processes involved in the injurious cascade of IRI. Therefore, volatile anesthetic (VA) agents might be the preferred anesthetics used during the transplantation procedure.

Consequently, kidney transplant recipients paradoxically are at risk for both thrombosis and bleeding.

Systemic venous, systemic arterial, and renal venous samples were taken at multiple timepoints during and after LDKT. Levels of mtDNA genes changed over time and between vascular compartments. Several donor, recipient, and transplantation-related variables significantly explained the course of mtDNA genes over time. mtDNA genes predicted 1-month and 24-month estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and acute rejection episodes in the two-year follow-up period. To conclude, mtDNA is released in plasma during the process of LDKT, either from the kidney or from the whole body in response to transplantation.

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the quality of evidence of the included studies, determine the prevalence of frailty among kidney transplant candidates, and evaluate the relationship between frailty and associated patient characteristics and outcomes after kidney transplantation. A systematic search was performed for relevant literature on frailty and kidney transplantation. This was followed by a meta-analysis for patient characteristics and outcomes reported by a minimum of 2 studies including mean age, gender, mean body mass index, type of kidney transplantation, dialysis, previous kidney transplantation, comorbidities, hypertension, race, preemptive kidney transplantation, delayed graft function, and length of stay. A total of 18 studies were included in the systematic review and 14 of those studies were suitable for meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of frailty before transplantation was estimated at 17.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.4-18.7). Frailty was significantly associated with higher age (mean difference, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-5.9), lower rate of preemptive transplantation (relative risk, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9), longer duration of delayed graft function (relative risk, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0), and length of stay longer than 2 wk (odds ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3). One in 6 kidney transplant recipients is frail before transplantation. The presence of frailty is associated with lower rates of preemptive transplantation, older recipient age, higher rates of delayed graft function, and longer length of stay. Future research is required to explore the association of frailty with other adverse outcomes after kidney transplantation and the effects of intervention programs to improve the different frailty domains.},

Intraoperative heparin and antiplatelet therapy were not associated with increased bleeding risk. These regimens appear to be safe for the possible prevention of TEC without increasing the risk for bleeding after KTx.},

We studied the ability of four biomarkers (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), liver-type fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP), cystatin C, and YKL-40) to predict DGF after deceased donor transplantation, and their association with early graft function and GFR at three and twelve months. 225 deceased donor kidney transplant recipients were included. Biomarkers were measured using automated assays or ELISA. We calculated their ability to predict the need for dialysis post-transplant and correlated with the estimated time to a 50% reduction in plasma creatinine (tCr50), measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) and estimated GFR (eGFR). All biomarkers measured at Day 1, except urinary L-FABP, significantly correlated with tCr50 and mGFR at Day 5. Plasma NGAL at Day 1 and a timed urine output predicted DGF (AUC = 0.91 and AUC 0.98).

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing any of the known PEDs with placebo during intensive-care unit (ICU) admission was performed, excluding erythropoietin stimulating agents. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, while outcomes from non-eligible studies for meta-analysis were reported separately. Risk of bias was assessed through the cochrane risk of bias (ROB) 2 tool. Twenty-three studies were included. Only studies using growth hormone, nandrolone, and oxandrolone were found. Growth hormone improved nitrogen balance (standardized mean difference = 1.4 g, 95% confidence interval 0.47-2.32). While mortality was unaffected, it caused increased ICU and hospital stay. A substantial heterogeneity and a concerning risk of bias were present among the studies. PEDs showed no survival benefit but may improve nitrogen balance. A possible subgroup that could benefit from growth hormone or anabolic steroids are critically ill patients who have surpassed the acute inflammatory phase of critical illness. Further research into various aspects of PEDs is needed within the context of current clinical practices.},

Systemic venous, arterial, renal venous, and urinary samples were collected in donors and recipients before, during, and after transplantation. R-SH was measured colorimetrically. Systemic arterial R-SH levels in recipients increased significantly up to 30 sec after reperfusion (p < 0.001). In contrast, renal venous R-SH levels significantly decreased at 5 and 10 min compared to 30 sec after reperfusion (both p < 0.001). This resulted in a significant decrease in delta R-SH (defined as the difference between renal venous and systemic arterial R-SH levels) till 30 sec after reperfusion (p < 0.001), indicating a net decrease in R-SH levels across the transplanted kidney. Overall, these results suggest trans-renal oxidative stress as a consequence of IRI during kidney transplantation, reflected by systemic and renal changes in R-SH levels in transplant recipients.},

Eight female Dutch Landrace pigs were exposed to unilateral renal ischemia for 45 minutes with simultaneous cannulation of the ureter of the ischemic kidney. ARA290 or saline was administered by an intravenous injection at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-reperfusion. The animals were sacrificed seven days post-reperfusion. ARA290 increased glomerular filtration rate during the observation period of seven days. Furthermore, ARA290 tended to reduce MCP-1 and IL-6 expression 15 minutes post-reperfusion. Seven days post-reperfusion ARA290 reduced interstitial fibrosis. The improvement in renal function following renal ischemia/reperfusion and reduced structural damage observed in this study by ARA290 warrants further investigation towards clinical application.},

Although several studies have investigated risk factors for the development of cognitive impairment in the early postoperative phase, risk factors for pNCD at 3 months have been less well studied. The aim of this study was to identify potential anaesthesia-related risk factors for pNCD at 3 months after surgery. We analysed data obtained for a prospective observational study in patients aged ≥ 65 years who underwent surgery for excision of a solid tumour. Cognitive function was assessed preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively using 5 neuropsychological tests. Postoperative NCD was defined as a postoperative decline of ≥ 25% relative to baseline in ≥ 2 tests. The association between anaesthesia-related factors (type of anaesthesia, duration of anaesthesia, agents used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia and analgesia, the use of additional vasoactive medication, depth of anaesthesia [bispectral index] and mean arterial pressure) and pNCD was analysed using logistic regression analyses. Furthermore, the relation between anaesthesia-related factors and change in cognitive test scores expressed as a continuous variable was analysed using a z-score. Of the 196 included patients, 23 (12%) fulfilled the criteria for pNCD at 3 months postoperatively. A low preoperative score on Mini-Mental State Examination (OR, 8.9 [95% CI, (2.8-27.9)], p < 0.001) and a longer duration of anaesthesia (OR, 1.003 [95% CI, (1.001-1.005)], p = 0.013) were identified as risk factors for pNCD. On average, patients scored higher on postoperative tests (mean z-score 2.35[± 3.13]). In this cohort, duration of anaesthesia, which is probably an expression of the complexity of the surgery, was the only anaesthesia-related predictor of pNCD. On average, patients' scores on cognitive tests improved postoperatively.},

RIC consisted of 4 × 5-min thigh occlusion by an inflatable tourniquet each followed by 5-min deflation, performed during surgery prior to graft reperfusion. The tourniquet remained deflated for sham-RIC. The primary endpoint was the estimated time to a 50% decrease in baseline plasma creatinine (tCr50) calculated from plasma creatinine measurements 30 days posttransplant or 30 days after the last, posttransplant dialysis. No significant differences were observed between RIC and sham-RIC-treated patients in the primary outcome median tCr50 (122 h [95% confidence interval [CI] 98-151] vs. 112 h [95% CI 91-139], p = 0.58), or the number of patients receiving dialysis in the first posttransplant week (33% vs. 35%, p = 0.71).

Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of SCS' drawbacks remain poorly understood. One of the mechanisms that drives delayed graft function (DGF) and poorer transplant outcomes is suggested to entail increased oxidative stress due to prolonged cold ischemia, thus driving lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis via iron-mediated Fenton chemistry. Here, we investigate whether iron chelation with deferasirox can prevent the Fenton reaction and thereby mitigate lipid peroxidation and improve kidney preservation. Porcine kidneys underwent 24 h of SCS in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution with or without deferasirox (60 µmol), followed by 3 h of normothermic machine perfusion (NMP). Deferasirox-treated kidneys exhibited significantly lower lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by reduced 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4HNE)-protein adduct levels, without altering antioxidative capacity manifested by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) expression. Metabolic stability was enhanced, with increased glucose availability and a higher glucose-to-lactate ratio, suggesting improved oxidative phosphorylation. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels remained stable, indicating no adverse mitochondrial effects. Additionally, deferasirox reduced kidney weight gain, which may reflect lower edema formation, and strongly improved glomerular integrity and reduced tubular dilation. By reducing lipid peroxidation and maintaining metabolic function, deferasirox may help mitigate ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), enhance early graft function, and improve transplant outcomes. These findings strengthen the role of iron in cold-induced oxidative damage, and imply that iron chelation is a promising adjunct to improve graft preservation.},

Understanding the signaling transduction pathways of renal ischemic conditioning can promote further clinical translation and pharmacological advancements in this era. This review summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms underlying both local and remote ischemic pre-, per- and postconditioning of the kidney. The different types of conditioning strategies in the kidney recruit similar powerful pro-survival mechanisms.

This is an ongoing debate since more than 25 years, representing a scientific, cultural as well as geographical divide in the anesthesia community. The Pro side argues that total intravenous anesthesia causes less postoperative nausea and higher patient satisfaction than anesthesia using volatile anesthetics. Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of anesthetic agents allows for better titration of intravenous anesthesia using pharmacokinetic models. Processed EEG monitors, such as bispectral index monitoring, allows for better assessing the effect of TCI anesthesia than solely assessment of clinical parameters, such as ECG or blood pressure. The combination of TCI propofol and objective depth of anesthesia monitoring allows creating a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile for each patient. Finally, anesthesia using volatile anesthetics poses health risks for healthcare professionals and contributes to greenhouse effect. The Con side argues that for procedures accompanied with ischemia and reperfusion injury of an organ or tissue and for patients suffering from a severe inflammation' the use of volatile anesthetics might well have its advantages above propofol. In times of sudden shortage of drugs, volatile anesthetics can overcome the restriction in the operating theater or even on the intensive care unit, which is another advantage. Volatile anesthetics can be used for induction of anesthesia when IV access is impossible, end-tidal measurements of volatile anesthetic concentration allows confirmation that patients receive anesthetics. Taking environmental considerations into account, both propofol and volatile anesthetics bear certain harm to the environment, be it as waste product or as greenhouse gases. The authors therefore suggest to carefully considering advantages and disadvantages for each patient in its according environment. A well-balanced choice based on the available literature is recommended. The authors recommend careful consideration of advantages and disadvantages of each technique when tailoring an anesthetic to meet patient needs. Where appropriate, anesthesia providers are encouraged to account for unique features of anesthetic drug behavior, patient-reported and observed postoperative outcomes, and economic and environmental considerations when choosing any of the 2 described techniques.},

Postoperative complications were measured by the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Using a linear regression model, 30-day postoperative complications and frailty correlation were adjusted for confounders, including sex, age, ASA Score, Charlson Comorbidity Index, hypertension, BMI, smoking, dialysis, duration of dialysis, type of transplantation, and retransplantation. The mean frailty score was 2.07(±1.6) and 23 patients were classified as frail (GFI ≥4).

The primary endpoint is the incidence of delayed graft function in recipients of DCD and DBD donor kidneys and/or 1-year biopsy-proven and treated acute rejection. Secondary endpoints include functional delayed graft function defined as failure of serum creatinine levels to decrease by at least 10% per day for three consecutive days; primary non-function is defined as a permanent lack of function of the allograft; length of hospital stay and postoperative complications of all kinds, estimated glomerular filtration rate at 1 week and 3 and 12 months calculated with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula; readmissions at 3 and 12 months, graft survival and all-cause mortality at 12 months. The study is approved by the local ethical committees and national data security agencies. Results are expected to be published in 2025. NCT02727296.},

The following abstracts are from the Cornelia de Lange Syndrome Scientific and Educational Symposium held virtually in October 2020. Aspects of behavior, including autistic features, impulsivity, adaptive skills, executive function, and anxiety are described. Applied behavioral analysis is a promising approach for autism, and an N-acetylcysteine trial is proposed. Children below 6 years with CdLS have an increased number of and further travel to medical providers, with insurance type comprising a significant barrier. Speech, language, and feeding abilities fall significantly below expectations for age in CdLS. Augmentative alternative communication can yield potential barriers as well as interesting benefits. Developmentally, studies in animal models further elucidate the mechanisms and roles of cohesin: link with mediator transcriptional complex; facilitation of enhancer-promoter communication; regulation of gene expression; allocation of cells to germ layers; and repair of spontaneous DNA damage in placental cells. Genome and RNA sequencing can help identify the molecular cause in the 20% of individuals with suspected CdLS and negative testing. The phenotypes in individuals with variants in the SMC1A gene are distinct, and that with intractable seizures has been further evaluated. AMA CME credits provided by GBMC, Baltimore, MD.

Subjects were overweight (BMI>27) patients with type 2 diabetes (52% female) from a Dutch hospital (mean age 58.14, S.D.=8.86). No differences in the outcomes were found between the intervention and control groups at 3 (T2) or 6 (T3) months. However, results at T2 and T3 revealed that patients with higher SR-skills scores had lower HbA1c levels than patients with lower scores. The SR-intervention did not significantly influence the outcomes. This apparent lack of effect might, however, partly be due to high attrition rates in all treatment groups. SR-skills were positively related to changes in HbA1c-levels. Improving SR-skills of overweight diabetes type 2 patients may improve their glycemic control. Patients who are 'external regulators' may however profit more from directive than from SR-interventions.},

Despite a lack of explicit communication, expectations of parents and siblings regarding future responsibilities corresponded. However, some siblings mentioned the lack of explicit communication made them feel unprepared for the future.

Results of questionnaire studies are compared to those in individuals with Down Syndrome and with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Results on cognition and self-injurious behaviour (SIB) are compared to those in individuals with CdLS caused by NIPBL variants. For Dutch participants with SMC1A variants we performed direct in-person assessments of cognition, autism, and added an interview and questionnaire on adaptive behaviour and sensory processing. Individuals with SMC1A variants show a higher cognitive level and less SIB than individuals with NIPBL variants. Individuals with SMC1A variants without classic CdLS phenotype but with a Rett-like phenotype show more severe intellectual disability and more SIB compared to those with a CdLS phenotype. Autism is less present if outcomes in direct in-person assessments are evaluated taking developmental level into account compared to results based on a questionnaire. Behaviour in individuals with CdLS should be evaluated taking genetic cause into account. Detailed interdisciplinary approaches are of clinical importance to inform tailored care and may eventually improve quality of life of patients and families.},

We examined whether middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients show reduced white matter integrity in fiber tracts important for cognition and whether this abnormality is related to preestablished altered resting-state functional connectivity in the default mode network (DMN). Diabetic and nondiabetic participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive assessment. Multiple diffusion measures were calculated using streamline tractography, and correlations with DMN functional connectivity were determined. Diabetic patients showed lower fractional anisotropy (FA) (a measure of white matter integrity) in the cingulum bundle and uncinate fasciculus. Control subjects showed stronger functional connectivity than patients between the posterior cingulate and both left fusiform and medial frontal gyri. FA of the cingulum bundle was correlated with functional connectivity between the posterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus for combined groups. Thus, middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes show white matter abnormalities that correlate with disrupted functional connectivity in the DMN, suggesting that common mechanisms may underlie structural and functional connectivity. Detecting brain abnormalities in middle age enables implementation of therapies to slow progression of neuropathology.},

Only described in female patients, SMC1A epilepsy syndrome is characterized by the onset of severe refractory epileptic seizures in the first year of life, global developmental delay, a variable degree of intellectual disability, and dysmorphic facial features not typical of CdLS. This was a descriptive observational study for the largest international cohort with this specific disorder. The main goal of this study was to improve the knowledge of the natural history of this phenotype with particular attention to the psychomotor development and the epilepsy data. The analyzed cohort shows normal prenatal growth with the subsequent development of postnatal microcephaly. The incidence of neonatal problems (seizures and respiratory compromise) is considerable (51.4%). There is a significant prevalence of central nervous system (20%) and cardiovascular malformations (20%). Motor skills are generally delayed. The presence of drug-resistant epilepsy is confirmed; the therapeutic role of a ketogenic diet is still uncertain. The significant regression of previously acquired skills following the onset of seizures has been observed. Facial dysmorphisms are variable and no patient shows a classic CdLS phenotype. To sum up, SMC1A variants caused drug-resistant epilepsy in these patients, more than two-thirds of whom were shown to progress to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. The SMC1A gene variants are all different from each other (apart from a couple of monozygotic twins), demonstrating the absence of a mutational hotspot in the SMC1A gene. Owing to the absence of phenotypic specificity, whole-exome sequencing is currently the diagnostic gold standard.},

We performed an international, interdisciplinary study on 51 individuals with SMC1A variants for physical and behavioral characteristics, and compare results to those in 67 individuals with NIPBL variants. For the Netherlands all known individuals with SMC1A variants were studied, both with and without CdLS phenotype. Individuals with SMC1A variants can resemble CdLS, but manifestations are less marked compared to individuals with NIPBL variants: growth is less disturbed, facial signs are less marked (except for periocular signs and thin upper vermillion), there are no major limb anomalies, and they have a higher level of cognitive and adaptive functioning. Self-injurious behavior is more frequent and more severe in the NIPBL group. In the Dutch group 5 of 13 individuals (all females) had a phenotype that shows a remarkable resemblance to Rett syndrome: epileptic encephalopathy, severe or profound intellectual disability, stereotypic movements, and (in some) regression. Their missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations are evenly spread over the gene. We conclude that SMC1A variants can result in a phenotype resembling CdLS and a phenotype resembling Rett syndrome. Resemblances between the SMC1A group and the NIPBL group suggest that a disturbed cohesin function contributes to the phenotype, but differences between these groups may also be explained by other underlying mechanisms such as moonlighting of the cohesin genes.},

A clinical trial was conducted with 101 overweight/obese (body mass index >27) diabetes type 2 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to a self-regulation intervention, an active control group, and a passive control group. Psychological, somatic, socio-demographic, and lifestyle variables were examined as predictors of drop-out from baseline to 6 months follow-up. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that low autonomous regulation or low 'goal ownership' was the best predictor of drop-out. It is suggested that the assessment of 'goal ownership' prior to a weight reduction intervention could identify patients who are sufficiently motivated to participate. Patients who score low on 'goal ownership' may be offered pretreatment interventions to increase their motivation.},

We propose a template-based digital intervention design mechanism enabling the configuration of evidence-based, just-in-time, adaptive intervention components. The design mechanism incorporates a rule definition language enabling experts to specify triggering conditions for interventions based on momentary and historical contextual/personal data. The framework continuously monitors and processes personal data space and evaluates intervention-triggering conditions. We benefit from reinforcement learning methods to develop personalized intervention delivery strategies with respect to timing, frequency, and type (content) of interventions. To validate the personalization algorithm, we lay out a simulation testbed with 2 personas, differing in their various simulated real-life conditions. We evaluate the design mechanism by presenting example intervention definitions based on behavior change taxonomies and clinical guidelines. Furthermore, we provide intervention definitions for a real-world care program targeting diabetes patients. Finally, we validate the personalized delivery mechanism through a set of hypotheses, asserting certain ways of adaptation in the delivery strategy, according to the differences in simulation related to personal preferences, traits, and lifestyle patterns. While the design mechanism is sufficiently expandable to meet the theoretical and clinical intervention design requirements, the personalization algorithm is capable of adapting intervention delivery strategies for simulated real-life conditions.},

We formed an international, multidisciplinary working group that developed an accessible questionnaire including key issues about adults with RTS and disseminated this to all known RTS support groups via social media. We report the observations from a cohort of 87 adult individuals of whom 43 had a molecularly confirmed diagnosis. The adult natural history of RTS is defined by prevalent behavioural/psychiatric problems (83%), gastrointestinal problems (73%) that are represented mainly by constipation; and sleep problems (62%) that manifest in a consistent pattern of sleep apnoea, difficulty staying asleep and an increased need for sleep. Furthermore, over than half of the RTS individuals (65%) had skin and adnexa-related problems. Half of the individuals receive multidisciplinary follow-up and required surgery at least once, and most frequently more than once, during adulthood. Our data confirm that adults with RTS enjoy both social and occupational possibilities, show a variegated experience of everyday life but experience a significant morbidity and ongoing medical issues which do not appear to be as coordinated and multidisciplinary managed as in paediatric patients. We highlight the need for optimal care in a multidisciplinary setting including the pivotal role of specialists for adult care.},

Several explorative studies have applied linear dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and classical Multi-Dimensional Scaling (cMDS) to gain insight into the spatial organization of these expression patterns. In this paper, we describe a non-linear embedding technique called Barnes-Hut Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (BH-SNE) that emphasizes the local similarity structure of high-dimensional data points. By applying BH-SNE to the gene expression data from the Allen Brain Atlases, we demonstrate the consistency of the 2D, non-linear embedding of the sagittal and coronal mouse brain atlases, and across 6 human brains. In addition, we quantitatively show that BH-SNE maps are superior in their separation of neuroanatomical regions in comparison to PCA and cMDS. Finally, we assess the effect of higher-order principal components on the global structure of the BH-SNE similarity maps. Based on our observations, we conclude that BH-SNE maps with or without prior dimensionality reduction (based on PCA) provide comprehensive and intuitive insights in both the local and global spatial transcriptome structure of the human and mouse Allen Brain Atlases.},

There is increasing attention for somatic substrates of behavior in genetic syndromes, and growing evidence of an association between pain and discomfort with SIB in people with ID and genetic syndromes. In this review on SIB phenomenology in people with ID in general and in twelve genetic syndromes, we summarize different SIB characteristics across these etiologically distinct entities and identify influencing factors. We demonstrate that the prevalence of SIB in several well-known genetic intellectual disability syndromes is noticeably higher than in individuals with ID in general, and that characteristics such as age of onset and topographies differ widely across syndromes. Each syndrome is caused by a mutation in a different gene, and this allows detection of several pathways that lead to SIB. Studying these with the behavioral consequences as specific aim will be an important step toward targeted early interventions and prevention.},

However, how lipidation at different sites in a membrane protein affects structure and function remains elusive. Here, using native mass spectrometry we determined that wild-type human tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 exhibit nonstochastic distributions of bound acyl chains. We revealed CD9 lipidation at its three most frequent lipidated sites suffices for EWI-F binding, while cysteine-to-alanine CD9 mutations markedly reduced binding of EWI-F. EWI-F binding by CD9 was rescued by mutating all or, albeit to a lesser extent, only the three most frequently lipidated sites into tryptophans. These mutations did not affect the nanoscale distribution of CD9 in cell membranes, as shown by super-resolution microscopy using a CD9-specific nanobody. Thus, these data demonstrate site-specific, possibly conformation-dependent, functionality of lipidation in tetraspanin CD9 and identify tryptophan mimicry as a possible biochemical approach to study site-specific transmembrane-protein lipidation.},

The presence of disease exacerbates this further, increasing the need for an automated solution. To this extent, SynthSeg is a robust deep learning model designed for automatic brain segmentation across various contrasts and resolutions. This study validates the SynthSeg robust brain segmentation model on computed tomography (CT), using a multi-center dataset. An open access dataset of 260 paired CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from radiotherapy patients treated in 5 centers was collected. Brain segmentations from CT and MRI were obtained with SynthSeg model, a component of the Freesurfer imaging suite. These segmentations were compared and evaluated using Dice scores and Hausdorff 95 distance (HD95), treating MRI-based segmentations as the ground truth. Brain regions that failed to meet performance criteria were excluded based on automated quality control (QC) scores. Dice scores indicate a median overlap of 0.76 (IQR: 0.65-0.83). The mean volume difference is 7.79% (CI: 6.41%-9.18%), with CT segmentations typically smaller than MRI-based. The median HD95 is 2.95 mm (IQR: 1.73-5.39). QC score based thresholding improves median dice by 0.1 and median HD95 by 0.05 mm. Morphological differences related to sex and age, as detected by MRI, were also replicated with CT, with an approximate 17% difference between the CT and MRI results for sex and 10% difference between the results for age. SynthSeg can be utilized for CT-based automatic brain segmentation, but only in applications where precision is not essential. CT performance is lower than MRI based on the integrated QC scores, but low-quality segmentations can be excluded with QC-based thresholding. Additionally, performing CT-based neuroanatomical studies is encouraged, as the results show correlations in sex- and age-based analyses similar to those found with MRI.},

We conducted an interpretative synthesis of literature on tacit knowledge in caregiving dyads with persons with PIMD, persons with dementia or infants. Twelve studies were included. Tacit knowledge is about caregivers and care-recipients becoming sensitive and responsive to each other's cues and together crafting care routines. Learning takes place in a constant process of action and response that transforms those involved. Building tacit knowledge together is necessary for persons with PIMD to learn to recognise and express their needs. Suggestions are made for ways to facilitate its development and transfer.},

Descriptive anatomic study. Ten knees from 8 cadavers were dissected and the PCL was identified. The ligament was peeled away from its insertion and the sides of the insertion site were measured and recorded. The 4 corners of the insertion site were identified and marked. Observations were made of the morphology of the insertion site and the presence of any reproducible anatomic landmarks. A note was made of landmarks that could be easily identified on all of the specimens by direct vision and by palpation with a probe. The ligament consisted of 2 regions, 1 anterolateral, and 1 posteromedial, with a gradual change in the laxity of the ligament as the knee was passed through flexion and extension. The insertion site was situated in a depression between the plateaus of the tibia and extended below the articular surface. The average length +/- standard deviation of the 4 sides was 128 +/- 21.2 mm (medial side), 107 +/- 26.5 mm (superior side), 160 +/- 30.0 mm (lateral side), and 169 +/- 34.5 mm (inferior side). The shape and sides of the insertion site were visually similar among the 10 specimens. The superolateral and superomedial corners were both represented by depressions and a reproducible ridge represented the inferior border. These structures could be visualized as well as palpated on all specimens. Based on the findings of this study, we describe the anatomic characteristics of the tibial footprint of the PCL. Anatomic reference points that represent the corners of the tibial insertion of the PCL were identified by direct vision or palpation consistently on all specimens included in the study. These reference points could potentially aid in the placement of an anterolateral and posteromedial tibial tunnel for a 2 tibial tunnel PCL reconstruction. Reproducible anatomic reference points exist at the tibial insertion of the PCL that can be identified by direct vision and palpation. These reference points may potentially aid in the placement of separate tibial tunnels for a 2-bundle PCL reconstruction.},

A device to deliver bone graft evenly throughout the tibial tunnel was developed. Forty mature sheep underwent simulated quadruple hamstring tendon-ACL reconstruction by use of a bioresorbable interference screw, either with or without bone graft augmentation of the tibial tunnel. Endpoint data were derived at time 0 and after 6 weeks in vivo. Radiostereometric analysis provided quantitation of the translational characteristics; computed tomography evaluated tunnel volume, and measures of yield strength and stiffness were obtained. Sequential fluorochrome administration assessed bone formation, and light microscopy surveyed the biological response. Radiostereometric analysis highlighted differences in the translational characteristics of ACL-deficient knees when compared with intact knees. Reconstructed knees (with or without autograft) showed significantly greater translation when compared with unoperated knees at 6 weeks; autograft bone augmentation provided no benefit. Neither tunnel volume nor yield strength nor stiffness was improved with the addition of autograft bone. No untoward histologic responses were observed. Bone apposition rates were similar between treatment groups. An even distribution of bone graft throughout the tunnels was observed. This model has confirmed the ability of the bone graft-delivery system to evenly distribute bone graft throughout the tunnels. However, the study has failed to show improvement in stability or fixation strength after augmentation with autograft bone. The autograft bone-delivery system may provide a means of establishing an osteoconductive/inductive environment. At this early juncture (6 weeks), no benefit could be defined. Its use in combination with bone morphogenetic proteins or stem cells may provide more rapid fixation, rehabilitation, and reconstitution of bone volume within the tunnel.},

After completion the replies were entered on the PRINTO website. Replies could either be entered directly by parents on the website or on paper. In these cases, the replies were scanned and emailed by local hospital staff to Utrecht where they were entered by I.R. in the database. The survey was completed by 622 parents in 23 countries. The majority (66.7%) of patients were female, with median age 10-11 years at the completion of the questionnaire. Frequencies of self-reported JIA categories corresponded to literature. Some patients had never been referred to the ophthalmologist (22.8%) or physiotherapist (31.7%). Low rates of referral or access to fatigue (3.5%) or pain management teams (10.0%), age appropriate disease education (11.3%), special rehabilitation (13.7%) and support groups (20.1%) were observed.

While on immunosuppressive drugs, about one half of patients did not receive information about immunizations, travelling, possible infections or how to deal with chickenpox or shingles. Low rates of referral to health care professionals may be due to children whose illness is well managed and who do not need additional support or information. Improvements are needed, especially in the areas of supportive care and information patients receive. It is also important to improve doctor patient communication between visits. Physicians can be instrumental in the setting up of support groups and increasing patients' awareness of existing support. Suggestions are given to convey crucial pieces of information structurally and repeatedly to ensure, among other things, compliance.},

As in many areas of daily life, digitalization is becoming increasingly important in the medical field amid the exponential rise in the use of computers and smartphones.

An online survey entitled "Digital online Patient Informed Consent for Anesthesia before Elective Surgery. Recent practice in Europe," with a total of 27 questions, was sent by the European Society of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) to their members in 47 European countries. To assess the effect of the economy on digitalization and legal status with regard to anesthesia consent, data were stratified based on gross domestic product per capita (GDPPC). In total, 23.1% and 37.2% of the 930 participants indicated that it was possible to obtain consent online or via telephone, respectively. This observation was more often reported in countries with high GDPPC levels than in countries with low GDPPC levels. Furthermore, 27.3% of the responses for simple anesthesia, 18.7% of the responses for complex anesthesia, and 32.2% of the responses for repeated anesthesia indicated that remote consent was in accordance with the law, and this was especially prevalent in countries with high GDPPC. Concerning the timing of consent, patients were informed at least one day before in 67.1% of cases for simple procedures and in 85.2% of cases for complex procedures. Even European countries with high GDPPC use remote informed consent only in a minority of cases, and most of the time for repeated anesthetic procedures.

Venous oxygen saturations represent this relationship between oxygen delivery and oxygen demand and can therefore be used as an additional parameter to detect an impaired cardiorespiratory reserve. Before appropriate use of venous oxygen saturations, however, one should be aware of the physiology. Although venous oxygen saturation has been the subject of research for many years, increasing interest arose especially in the past decade for its use as a therapeutic goal in critically ill patients and during the perioperative period. Also, there has been debate on differences between mixed and central venous oxygen saturation and their interchangeability. Both mixed and central venous oxygen saturation are clinically useful but both variables should be used with insightful knowledge and caution. In general, low values warn the clinician about cardiocirculatory or metabolic impairment and should urge further diagnostics and appropriate action, whereas normal or high values do not rule out persistent tissue hypoxia. The use of venous oxygen saturations seems especially useful in the early phase of disease or injury. Whether venous oxygen saturations should be measured continuously remains unclear. Especially, continuous measurement of central venous oxygen saturation as part of the treatment protocol has been shown a valuable strategy in the emergency department and in cardiac surgery. In clinical practice, venous oxygen saturations should always be used in combination with vital signs and other relevant endpoints.},

The challenges they face are twofold: coping with changes in tasks or responsibilities and performing (new) social roles. This process of 'learning the ropes' is known as Organizational Socialization (OS). Although there is substantial literature on transitions from the perspective of residents, the voices of program directors (PDs) who facilitate and guide residents through the organizational socialization process have not yet been explored. PDs' perspectives are important, since PDs are formally responsible for Postgraduate Medical Education (PGME) and contribute, directly or indirectly, to residents' socialization process. Using the lens of OS, we explored what strategies PDs use to facilitate organizational socialization of newcomer residents. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 PDs of different specialties. We used a theory-informing inductive data analysis study design, comprising an inductive thematic analysis, a deductive interpretation of the results through the lens of OS and, subsequently, an inductive analysis to identify overarching insights. We identified six strategies PDs used to facilitate organizational socialization of newcomer residents and uncovered two overarching insights. First, PDs varied in the extent to which they planned their guidance. Some PDs planned socialization as an explicit learning objective and assigned residents' tasks and responsibilities accordingly, making it an intended program outcome. However, socialization was also facilitated by social interactions in the workplace, making it an unintended program outcome. Second, PDs varied in the extent to which they adapted their strategies to the newcomer residents. Some PDs used individualized strategies tailored to individual residents' needs and skills, particularly in cases of poor performance, by broaching and discussing the issue or adjusting tasks and responsibilities. However, PDs also used workplace strategies requiring residents to adjust to the workplace without much intervention, which was often viewed as an implicit expectation. PDs' used both intentional and unintentional strategies to facilitate socialization in residents, which may imply that socialization can occur irrespective of the PD's strategy. PDs' strategies varied from an individual-centered to a workplace-centered approach to socialization. Further research is needed to gain a deeper understanding of residents' perceptions of PD's efforts to facilitate their socialization process during transitions.},

  abstract = {Well-being at work can be defined as "creating an environment to promote a state of contentment which allows an employee to flourish and achieve their full potential for the benefit of themselves and their organisation." In the health care context, well-being at work of nurses and doctors is important for good patient care. Moreover, it is strongly associated with individual- and organization-level consequences. Relevant literature presents models and concepts of physical, mental, and social well-being. This study uses the 6 elements of the job demands-resources (JD-R) model to interpret well-being at work (job demands, job resources, personal resources, leadership, well-being, and outcomes) as part of a Netherlands Federation of University Medical Hospitals program to find ways to improve and monitor health care professionals' well-being in Dutch hospitals. Many instruments exist to measure well-being at work in terms of population, setting, and other aspects. An overview of available and eligible instruments assessing and monitoring the well-being of nurses and doctors is currently missing. We will perform a scoping review aiming to provide an overview of validated instruments assessing and monitoring the well-being of nurses and doctors at work. We will perform a search of published literature in the following databases: Medline, Embase, and CINAHL. Studies will be eligible if they (1) assess well-being at work of nurses and doctors employed in hospitals; (2) describe an evaluation of an instrument or review an instrument; (3) measure well-being at work or aspects of well-being at work according to the elements of the JD-R model, and (4) were published in English from 2011 onwards. Title/abstract screening according to the eligibility criteria will be followed by full-text screening. Data extraction of included studies will be conducted by 3 reviewers independently. Reviewers will use standardized data extraction forms that include study characteristics, sample characteristics, measurement instrument details, and psychometric properties. The analysis will be descriptive. When synthesizing the data, a distinction will be made between comprehensive instruments and common instruments. This scoping review identifies instruments that have been developed and validated for monitoring the well-being of nurses and doctors at work. Studies were searched between September and December 2021 and screened between December 2021 and May 2022. A total of 739 studies were included. Timely screening of well-being at work may be beneficial for individual health care workers, the organization, and patients. There is often a substantial gap and mismatch between employer perceptions of well-being and well-being interventions. It is important to develop and implement suitable interventions adapted to the needs of nurses and doctors and their health or other problems. Well-being screening should be timely to gain insight into these needs and problems. Moreover, to determine the effectiveness of well-being interventions, measurement is mandatory. The results will be critical for organizations to select a monitoring instrument that best fits the needs of employees and organizations. DERR1-10.2196/43692.},

The Jobs Demands Resources (JD-R) model offers a framework for health at work, encompassing 'job demands', 'job resources', 'personal resources', 'leadership', 'well-being' and 'outcomes'. While various instruments exist to measure health, an overview of instruments specifically designed for assessing nurses and doctors health is currently missing. This study provides a comprehensive overview of available health instruments specifically developed and validated for healthcare professionals in hospital care. Scoping review. MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL. Studies assessing the health of nurses and/or doctors in hospitals using or evaluating instruments based on the JD-R model, published between January 2011 and January 2024, excluding student-exclusive samples. We extracted data on study and sample characteristics, as well as details of the measurement instruments, including main and subconstructs. Instruments were categorised based on the JD-R model domains. Descriptive analysis and data visualisation were performed using Excel and Python. We included 1204 studies, reporting 986 unique instruments. We identified 32 comprehensive instruments suitable for broad health screening, measuring four or more of the JD-R model domains. Additionally, we identified instruments focusing on specific domains for targeted screening needs. Furthermore, we present frequently reported instruments assumed to be extensively evaluated, user-friendly, accessible and available in multiple languages. Health at work cannot be determined by a single instrument alone, underscoring the multidimensional nature of workplace health. Alternatively, organisations should select instruments based on domains most relevant and applicable to their context. This approach ensures a more comprehensive assessment of health at work.},

An international survey was sent to veterinarians to understand individual fracture characteristics and management strategies as they relate to outcomes, with the goal of better informing treatment procedures. The data set consisted of 79 fractures from 64 elephants (including Asian and African males and females), 44.3% of which were Class III fractures with pulpal involvement. Of this subset, pulp canal exposures of >0.5 cm were 23.8-fold more likely to develop pulpitis than fractures with <0.5 cm exposed, though canal size did not impact healing versus extraction outcome. Odds ratios showed that treatments including endodontics were 12.0-fold more likely to heal than tusks treated exclusively with medical management, though no association was observed in reducing the risk of pulpitis. Further, pulpitis was 7.58-fold more likely to develop when tap water was used to rinse exposed pulpal tissue; a finding that merits further investigation. The use of endodontic treatment versus medical management alone was significantly associated with improved recovery outcomes (i.e., reduced risk of extraction) in tusk fractures with pulpal involvement.},

One cycle of IVF-eSET or three cycles of IUI-COS. Ongoing pregnancy per couple. We randomly allocated 116 women to IVF-eSET (n = 58) or IUI-COH (n = 58). There were 14 ongoing pregnancies (24%) in the IVF-eSET group and 12 pregnancies (21%) in the IUI-COS group (relative ratio 1.17; 95% confidence interval 0.60-2.30). There were two twin pregnancies in the IVF-eSET group (14%) and two twin pregnancies and one triplet pregnancy in the IUI-COH group (25%). In patients with unexplained or mild male subfertility and a poor prognosis for natural conception, one cycle of IVF-eSET might be as effective as three cycles of IUI-COS as primary treatment. Elective single embryo transfer does not seem an effective strategy in preventing multiple pregnancies in this particular population. In the future a strict SET policy (i.e., compulsory SET) might be an option. Our trial provides evidence for the feasibility and highlights the importance of a large definitive trial to determine the effectiveness and side effects of both strategies.},

Between January 2002 and February 2004, we prospectively included consecutive subfertile couples who had not been evaluated previously for subfertility. We estimated the contribution of the PCT result to the existing prediction model for spontaneous pregnancy by calculating the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of an abnormal PCT result. We constructed a second prediction model (PCT model) based on the reference model including the PCT. Primary endpoint in this study was ongoing pregnancy. We evaluated the performance of the PCT model in comparison with the reference model by calculating goodness of fit, discrimination, calibration, and the "net reclassification improvement". We included 3,021 couples of whom 537 (18%) had a spontaneous pregnancy and 55 (1.8%) a nonsuccessful pregnancy; 1,316 (44%) started treatment within 12 months, 824 (27%) neither started treatment nor became pregnant, and 289 (10%) became lost to follow-up within 12 months. The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62 to 0.94). The adjusted HR for an abnormal PCT was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47 to 0.84) in case of no spermatozoa, 0.81 (95% CI: 0.57 to 1.2) in case of nonmotile spermatozoa, and 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8 to 1.8) in case of motile, nonprogressive spermatozoa. Adding the PCT result to the reference model did not improve goodness of fit. Discrimination was equally poor for the PCT model and the reference model. The calibration plots of both models showed comparably good calibration. The net reclassification improvement of the predictions of the PCT model compared with the reference model was -1.1%. This study demonstrated that the PCT has prognostic value but does not add substantially to a prognostic model for spontaneous pregnancy.},

  abstract = {Multiple pregnancies are high risk pregnancies with higher chances of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. In the past decades the number of multiple pregnancies has increased. This trend is partly due to the fact that women start family planning at an increased age, but also due to the increased use of ART.Couples with unexplained or mild male subfertility generally receive intrauterine insemination IUI with controlled hormonal stimulation (IUI COH). The cumulative pregnancy rate is 40%, with a 10% multiple pregnancy rate.This study aims to reveal whether alternative treatments such as IVF elective Single Embryo Transfer (IVF e SET) or Modified Natural Cycle IVF (MNC IVF) can reduce the number of multiple pregnancy rates, but uphold similar pregnancy rates as IUI COH in couples with mild male or unexplained subfertility. Secondly, the aim is to perform a cost effective analyses and assess treatment preference of these couples. We plan a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of intra-uterine insemination with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation or six cycles of Modified Natural Cycle (MNC) IVF or three cycles with IVF-elective Single Embryo Transfer (eSET) plus cryo-cycles within a time frame of 12 months.Couples with unexplained subfertility or mild male subfertility and a poor prognosis for treatment independent pregnancy will be included. Women with anovulatory cycles, severe endometriosis, double sided tubal pathology or serious endocrine illness will be excluded.Our primary outcome is the birth of a healthy singleton. Secondary outcomes are multiple pregnancy, treatment costs, and patient experiences in each treatment arm. The analysis will be performed according tot the intention to treat principle. We will test for non-inferiority of the three arms with respect to live birth. As we accept a 12.5% loss in pregnancy rate in one of the two IVF arms to prevent multiple pregnancies, we need 200 couples per arm (600 couples in total). Determining the safest and most cost-effective treatment will ensure optimal chances of pregnancy for subfertile couples with substantially diminished perinatal and maternal complications. Should patients find the most cost-effective treatment acceptable or even preferable, this could imply the need for a world wide shift in the primary treatment.

Control measurements were made in four animals in which the vascular clamp was not adjusted. Fetal PaO2 fell from 20.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 16.6 +/- 0.6 mm Hg within 1 hour after application of the clamp and remained suppressed during 48 hours. There was a transient acidemia at 1 to 2 hours that had corrected by 8 hours. Fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone levels rose from 24 +/- 6 to 1320 +/- 205 pg/ml at 2 hours but decreased by 16 hours. Measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, more than 95% of immunoreactivity corresponded to adrenocorticotropic hormone1-39. Fetal cortisol levels rose by 6 hours and remained elevated through 48 hours. Maternal adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, and progesterone levels were unchanged during the study period. We conclude that fetal hypoxemia-acidemia after restriction of uterine blood flow provokes fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone release, but the elevation in adrenocorticotropic hormone is not sustained. However, the level of fetal cortisol rises progressively, consistent with fetal adrenal activation.},

Immunoreactive ACTH was observed in the oocytes of ovaries from humans, cows, pigs, pregnant and non-pregnant sheep, but not from cats or rats. Positive staining of oocytes was associated with all tertiary and secondary follicles, and some primary follicles. There was no apparent difference in the pattern of staining between pregnant and non-pregnant sheep. Staining for ir-ACTH was absent in ovaries from fetal sheep. We conclude that ir-ACTH is present in ovarian tissue, and in particular the oocyte, from several species of mammal.

Findings at THL were compared with findings at diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopies. Tubal occlusion, endometriosis and adhesions were defined as abnormalities. Out of 1119 women, 1103 women underwent THL. A complete evaluation or incomplete but diagnostic procedure could be performed in 989 (89.7%) and 28 (2.5%), respectively. An incomplete non-diagnostic procedure was performed in 11 (1.0%) women. Failure of THL occurred in 75 women (6.8%) and 40 of these women (3.6%) subsequently underwent laparoscopy. Laparoscopy was performed in a total of 126 patients with a median time interval of 7 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 3-13 weeks). Of 64 patients who successfully underwent both THL and laparoscopy, concordant findings were found in 53 women and discordant results in 11 women, 6 of which were caused by tubal spasm. Sensitivity of THL in detecting abnormalities was 100% and specificity was 22.2%, with a likelihood ratio of 1.29. THL in an outpatient setting can detect anatomical abnormalities comparable to the more invasive reference standard diagnostic laparoscopy. If THL succeeds, there is no need to add a diagnostic laparoscopy in the work-up.},

The retinas were exposed to white light (400-740 nm) at intensities between 65 and 140 mW/cm2 for 1 h. Two days after exposure, the increased leakage of fluorescein measured with vitreous fluorophotometry could be mimicked on electron microscopy by the tracers ferrous gluconate and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In cases of minimal fluorescein leakage, traces of HRP were found in the basal folds of the retina pigment epithelium (RPE). No HRP was observed apical to the tight junctions of the RPE cells. When there was a great amount of fluorescein leakage, HRP completely filled the RPE cytoplasm, the extracellular spaces, and several cells in the neuroretina. It is concluded that after exposure to low intensities of white light, blood-retina barrier dysfunction may be due to disruption of the RPE basal fold membrane, leading to increased transcellular passage. The intact tight junctions suggest the under these circumstances intercellular leakage is not a component of BRB dysfunction.},

If women do not conceive, treatment can be continued with gonadotropins or intra-uterine insemination (IUI). At present, it is unclear for how many cycles ovulation induction with CC should be repeated, and when to switch to ovulation induction with gonadotropins and/or IUI. We started a multicenter randomised controlled trial in the Netherlands comparing six cycles of CC plus intercourse or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus intercourse or six cycles of CC plus IUI or six cycles of gonadotrophins plus IUI.Women with WHO type II anovulation who ovulate but did not conceive after six ovulatory cycles of CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days will be included.Our primary outcome is birth of a healthy child resulting from a pregnancy that was established in the first eight months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes are clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, multiple pregnancy and treatment costs. The analysis will be performed according to the intention to treat principle. Two comparisons will be made, one in which CC is compared to gonadotrophins and one in which the addition of IUI is compared to ovulation induction only. Assuming a live birth rate of 40% after CC, 55% after addition of IUI and 55% after ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, with an alpha of 5% and a power of 80%, we need to recruit 200 women per arm (800 women in total).An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee has criticized the data of the first 150 women and concluded that a sample size re-estimation should be performed after including 320 patients (i.e. 80 per arm). The trial will provide evidence on the most effective, safest and most cost effective treatment in women with WHO type II anovulation who do not conceive after six ovulatory cycles with CC with a maximum of 150 mg daily for five days. This evidence could imply the need for changing our guidelines, which may cause a shift in large practice variation to evidence based primary treatment for these women.

In women with clomiphene-citrate resistant WHO group II anovulation, one of the treatment options is ovulation induction with exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH or follitropin). FSH is derived from urine or is produced as recombinant FSH. Two forms of recombinant FSH are available - follitropin alpha and follitropin beta. To evaluate the efficacy, safety, costs and acceptability of recombinant FSH, we performed a review to compare recombinant FSH with urinary-derived FSH products. Follitropin alpha, beta and urinary FSH products appeared to be equally effective in terms of pregnancy rates. Patient safety was also found to be comparable, as the incidence of side effects including multiple pregnancies was similar for all FSH products. In practice follitropin alpha and beta may be more convenient to use due to the ease of self-administration, but they are also more expensive than the urinary products.},

  abstract = {Is transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) non-inferior to hysterosalpingography (HSG) as a first-line tubal patency test in subfertile women in predicting the chance of conception leading to live birth? A multicentre, randomized controlled trial in four teaching hospitals in the Netherlands, which randomized subfertile women scheduled for tubal patency testing to either THL or HSG as a first-line tubal patency test. The primary outcome was conception leading to live birth within 24 months after randomization. A total of 149 women were randomized to THL and 151 to HSG. From the intention-to-treat population, 83 women from the THL group (58.5%) conceived and delivered a live born child within 24 months after randomization compared with 82 women (55.4%) in the HSG group (difference 3.0%, 95% CI -8.3 to 14.4). Time to conception leading to live birth was not statistically different between groups. Miscarriage occurred in 16 (11.3%) women in the THL group, versus 20 (13.5%) women in the HSG group (RR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.32, P = 0.237), and multiple pregnancies occurred in 12 (8.4%) women in the THL group compared with 19 (12.8%) women in the HSG group (RR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.55, P = 0.58). Ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed in two women in the HSG group (1.4%) and none in the THL group (P = 0.499). In a preselected group of subfertile women with a low risk of tubal pathology, use of THL was not inferior to HSG as a first-line test for predicting conception leading to live birth.},

This retrospective multicentre cohort study investigated the results of THL and subsequent pregnancy rates. Between 2000 and 2011, 1033 subfertile women participated in the study. The primary outcome measure was intrauterine pregnancy, either after natural conception or after treatment with intrauterine insemination or ovulation induction. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and fecundity rate ratios (FRR) were established. THL showed bilateral patent tubes in 83%, one-sided tubal occlusion in 12.4% and bilateral tubal occlusion in 4.6% of women. Cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rates after 36 months were 52% for women with bilateral patent tubes, 44% for one-sided tubal occlusion (FRR 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.39) and 7% for bilateral tubal occlusion (FRR 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.43). Endometriosis was diagnosed in 6.4%, and adhesions in 9.1%, while 3.9% of women had both. Corresponding FRR were 0.73 (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.09), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.46 to 1.02) and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.20 to 0.84). In conclusion, women with bilateral tubal occlusion or a combination of endometriosis and adhesions found on THL significantly reduced chances of natural conception.},

A European expert meeting was organized in Brussels, Belgium by the Benelux Neuromodulation Society in order to develop uniform MCS protocols in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses. An expert meeting was organized, and a questionnaire was sent out to all the invited participants before this expert meeting. An extensive literature research was conducted in order to enrich the results. Topics that were addressed during the expert meeting were 1) inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2) targeting and methods of stimulation, 3) effects of MCS, and 4) results from the questionnaire. Substantial commonalities but also important methodologic divergencies emerged from the discussion of MCS experts from 7 European Centers. From this meeting and questionnaire, all participants concluded that there is a need for more homogenous standardized protocols for MCS regarding patient selection, implantation procedure, stimulation parameters, and follow-up-course.},

So, in order to minimize invasiveness while optimizing repeatability, we sought to create an easily reproducible single-access port operative strategy. Four patients suffering from intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis for >10 years (12.8 ± 5.9) underwent a single-port unilateral R5-R11 splanchnotomy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. No operative complications were observed. All 4 patients experienced excellent pain relief with a significant improvement of Visual Analogue Scale pain scores (8.8 ± 1.0 preoperatively to 3.0 ± 1.2 postoperatively, P = 0.003). We report the first series of single-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) splanchnotomy for palliation of intractable pain due to chronic pancreatitis. From this small study, single-port VATS splanchnotomy seems to be a safe and effective alternative to multiportal or open procedures.},

The aim of this international questionnaire study was to assess patient-reported outcomes of this new treatment in GSD Ib patients. Patients and caregivers of pediatric patients were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire. This was designed to evaluate treatment effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin on clinical symptoms and important aspects of daily life including physical performance, sleep, social and work life, traveling, socioeconomic aspects, and quality of life. The questionnaire was completed by 73 respondents from 17 different countries. The mean duration of treatment was 15 months, the cumulative treatment time was 94.8 years. More than 80% of patients reported an improved quality of life. The number of hospitalizations was reduced (66% of patients), as well as the number of days absent from school or work. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment could be stopped in 49% of patients and reduced in another 42%. Clear improvement of neutropenia and all neutropenia-associated symptoms was reported by the majority of patients. Additionally, patients or caregivers reported positive effects on appetite (63%), level of activity (75%), overall well-being (96%), and sleep (63%). Empagliflozin positively impacts many aspects of daily life including work and social life and thereby significantly improves quality of life of patients and caregivers.},

The two groups self-assessed their knowledge and skills as adequate. However, the control group (N=111) had significantly more difficulty in delivering chest compressions deeper than 4 cm (25 versus 1 candidate in the CPREzy group), P=0.0001. The control group compressed ineffectively in 36% (+/-41%) of all compressions as opposed to 6+/-13% in the CPREzy group (N=112, P=0.0001). If compressions were effective initially, the time until >50% of compressions were less than 4 cm deep was 75+/-81s in the control group versus 194+/-87 s in the CPREzy group (P=0.0001 [-180 to -57.5]). After a few seconds of training in its use, our candidates used the CPREzy effectively. Against the background knowledge that estimation of compression depth by the rescuer or other team members is difficult, and that performing effective compressions is the cornerstone of any resuscitation attempt, our data suggests that a feedback device such as the CPREzy should be used consistently during resuscitation.},

The molecular mechanisms that regulate disease onset and progression are largely unknown. In order to identify molecular pathways that are consistently associated with OPMD, we performed an integrated high-throughput transcriptome study in affected muscles of OPMD animal models and patients. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) was found to be the most consistently and significantly OPMD-deregulated pathway across species. We could correlate the association of the UPS OPMD-deregulated genes with stages of disease progression. The expression trend of a subset of these genes is age-associated and therefore, marks the late onset of the disease, and a second group with expression trends relating to disease-progression. We demonstrate a correlation between expression trends and entrapment into PABPN1 insoluble aggregates of OPMD-deregulated E3 ligases. We also show that manipulations of proteasome and immunoproteasome activity specifically affect the accumulation and aggregation of mutant PABPN1. We suggest that the natural decrease in proteasome expression and its activity during muscle aging contributes to the onset of the disease.},

Additionally, a systematic literature review has been performed to identify instruments to quantify patient-reported outcome measures of psychosocial problems in hepatic GSD patients. Sixteen patients from 12 families were included with ages ranging between 3 and 24 years. Five out of sixteen patients were diagnosed with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder and six patients showed characteristics of this disorder. Fourteen patients experienced sleeping problems, and 11 out of 12 parent couples experienced stress about the illness of their child. We subsequently identified 26 instruments to quantify patient-reported outcome measures for GSD patients. This study demonstrates that GSD patients can develop Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder influencing quality of life at multiple domains. The identification of instruments to assess psychosocial wellbeing is an important step towards a standard set of patient-reported outcome measures.},

Results showed that psychosocial factors were associated with occupational accidents in both sectors. For the construction industry, high time pressure and exposure to violence and harassment by colleagues or supervisors were associated with occupational accidents. For the health and welfare sector, low autonomy and exposure to violence and harassment by colleagues or supervisors or by people outside the organization were associated with occupational accidents. The present paper stresses the importance of also taking psychological consequences and psychosocial factors at work into account in assessing the occurrence of occupational accidents.},

Here we investigated how symptoms in OPMD initiate only at midlife and why a subset of skeletal muscles is predominantly affected. Genome-wide RNA expression profiles from Vastus lateralis muscles human carriers of expanded-PABPN1 at pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages were compared with healthy controls. Major expression changes were found to be associated with age rather than with expression of expanded-PABPN1, instead transcriptomes of OPMD and elderly muscles were significantly similar (P<0.05). Using k-means clustering we identified age-dependent trends in both OPMD and controls, but trends were often accelerated in OPMD. We report an age-regulated decline in PABPN1 levels in Vastus lateralis muscles from the fifth decade. In concurrence with severe muscle degeneration in OPMD, the decline in PABPN1 accelerated in OPMD and was specific to skeletal muscles. Reduced PABPN1 levels (30% to 60%) in muscle cells induced myogenic defects and morphological signatures of cellular aging in proportion to PABPN1 expression levels. We suggest that PABPN1 levels regulate muscle cell aging and OPMD represents an accelerated muscle aging disorder.},

Here we report the first epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations and the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR). Epigenome-wide DNA methylation was measured using the Illumina 450K array on whole blood samples of 68 Ghanaians. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were assessed for plasma renin concentration, aldosterone, and ARR using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and technical covariates. Additionally, we extracted methylation loci previously associated with hypertension, kidney function, or that were annotated to RAAS-related genes and associated these with renin and aldosterone concentration. We identified one DMP for renin, ten DMPs for aldosterone, and one DMP associated with ARR. Top DMPs were annotated to the PTPRN2, SKIL, and KCNT1 genes, which have been reported in relation to cardiometabolic risk factors, atherosclerosis, and sodium-potassium handling. Moreover, EWAS loci previously associated with hypertension, kidney function, or RAAS-related genes were also associated with renin, aldosterone, and ARR. In this first EWAS on RAAS hormones, we identified DMPs associated with renin, aldosterone, and ARR in a SSA population. These findings are a first step in understanding the role of DNA methylation in regulation of the RAAS in general and in a SSA population specifically. Replication and translational studies are needed to establish the role of these DMPs in the hypertension burden in SSA populations.},

Patients receiving daycare, terminally ill patients and children were excluded. All direct healthcare costs from day of admission until 1 month after discharge. Health outcome concerned quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which was measured with the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D). We found no significant difference for QALY gain (+0.02, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.05) when comparing the PA/MD model with the MD model. Total costs per patient did not significantly differ between the groups (+€568, 95% CI -€254 to €1391, p=0.175). Regarding the costs per item, a difference of €309 per patient (95% CI €29 to €588, p=0.030) was found in favour of the MD model regarding length of stay. Personnel costs per patient for the provider who is primarily responsible for medical care on the ward were lower on the wards in the PA/MD model (-€11, 95% CI -€16 to -€6, p<0.01). This study suggests that the cost-effectiveness on wards managed by PAs, in collaboration with MDs, is similar to the care on wards with traditional house staffing. The involvement of PAs may reduce personnel costs, but not overall healthcare costs. NCT01835444.},

Epigenetic and genetic profiles were based on the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. We searched for differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). For genetic associations we analyzed the CpG-SNPs present on the array. We detected no genome-wide significant DMPs and we did not replicate previously reported DMPs associated with PTSD. However, GSE analysis of the top 100 DMPs showed enrichment of three genes involved in the dopaminergic neurogenesis pathway. Furthermore, we observed a suggestive association of one relatively large DMR between patients and controls, which was located at the PAX8 gene and previously associated with other psychiatric disorders. Finally, we validated five PTSD-associated CpG-SNPs identified with the array using sanger sequencing. We subsequently replicated the association of one common SNP (rs1990322) in the CACNA1C locus with PTSD in an independent cohort of traumatized children. The CACNA1C locus was previously associated with other psychiatric disorders, but not yet with PTSD. Thus, despite the small sample size, inclusion of extreme symptom severity phenotypes in a highly homogenous traumatized cohort enabled detection of epigenetic and genetic loci associated with PTSD. Moreover, here we showed that genetically confounded 450K probes are informative for genetic association analysis.},

However, the role of biological aging in this emerging burden of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) among migrant and non-migrant Africans is unknown. We aimed to examine differences in epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) as measured by four clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge and GrimAge) and their associations with cardiometabolic factors among migrant Ghanaians in Europe and non-migrant Ghanaians. Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) data of 712 Ghanaians from cross-sectional RODAM study were used to quantify EAA. We assessed correlation of DNAmAge measures with chronological age, and then performed linear regressions to determine associations of body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood pressure, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and one-carbon metabolism nutrients with EAA among migrant and non-migrants. We replicated our findings among 172 rural-urban sibling pairs from India migration study and among 120 native South Africans from PURE-SA-NW study. We found that Ghanaian migrants have lower EAA than non-migrants. Within migrants, higher FBG was positively associated with EAA measures. Within non-migrants, higher BMI, and Vitamin B9 (folate) intake were negatively associated with EAA measures. Our findings on FBG, BMI and folate were replicated in the independent cohorts. Our study shows that migration is negatively associated with EAA among Ghanaians. Moreover, cardiometabolic factors are differentially associated with EAA within migrant and non-migrant subgroups. Our results call for context-based interventions for CMD among transitioning populations that account for effects of biological aging. European Commission.},

CGM metrics (descriptive, glycemic variation and glycemic control parameters) were calculated for 47 liver GSD and 14 IKH patients, categorized in cohorts by disease subtype, age and treatment status, and compared to published age-matched CGM metrics from healthy individuals. Glycemic control was assessed as time-in-range (TIR; ≥3.9 - ≤7.8 and ≥3.9 - ≤10.0 mmol/L), time-below-range (TBR; <3.0 mmol/L and ≥3.0 - ≤3.9 mmol/L), and time-above-range (TAR; >7.8 and >10.0 mmol/L). Despite all patients receiving dietary treatment, GSD cohorts displayed significantly different CGM metrics compared to healthy individuals. Decreased TIR together with increased TAR were noted in GSD I, GSD III, and GSD XI (Fanconi-Bickel syndrome) cohorts (all p < 0.05). In addition, all GSD I cohorts showed increased TBR (all p < 0.05). In GSD IV an increased TBR (p < 0.05) and decreased TAR were noted (p < 0.05). In GSD IX only increased TAR was observed (p < 0.05). IKH patient cohorts, both with and without treatment, presented CGM metrics similar to healthy individuals. Despite dietary treatment, most liver GSD cohorts do not achieve CGM metrics comparable to healthy individuals. International recommendations on the use of CGM and clinical targets for CGM metrics in liver GSD patients are warranted, both for patient care and clinical trials.},

  abstract = {Up to 30% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) develop from sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). Within the serrated neoplasia pathway, at least two principally distinct oncogenetic routes exist generating microsatellite-stable and microsatellite-instable CRCs, respectively. Aberrant DNA methylation (DNAm) is found early in the serrated pathway and might play a role in both oncogenetic routes. We studied a cohort of 23 SSLs with a small focus (<10 mm) of dysplasia or cancer, 10 of which were MLH1 deficient and 13 MLH1 proficient. By comparing, for each SSL, the methylation status of (1) the region of dysplasia or cancer (SSL-D), (2) the nondysplastic SSL (SSL), and (3) adjacent normal mucosa, differentially methylated probes (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) were assessed both genome-wide as well as in a tumor-suppressor gene-focused approach. By comparing DNAm of MLH1-deficient SSL-Ds with their corresponding SSLs, we identified five DMRs, including those annotating for PRDM2 and, not unexpectedly, MLH1. PRDM2 gene promotor methylation was associated with MLH1 expression status, as it was largely hypermethylated in MLH1-deficient SSL-Ds and hypomethylated in MLH1-proficient SSL-Ds. Significantly increased DNAm levels of PRDM2 and MLH1, in particular at 'critical' MLH1 probe sites, were to some extent already visible in SSLs as compared to normal mucosa (p = 0.02, p = 0.01, p < 0.0001, respectively). No DMRs, nor DMPs, were identified for SSLs destined to evolve into MLH1-proficient SSL-Ds. Our data indicate that, within both arms of the serrated CRC pathway, the majority of the epigenetic alterations are introduced early during SSL formation. Promoter hypermethylation of PRDM2 and MLH1 on the other hand specifically initiates in SSLs destined to transform into MLH1-deficient CRCs suggesting that the fate of SSLs may not necessarily result from a stochastic process but possibly is already imprinted and predisposed.},

The majority of these findings showed directionally consistent associations with the respective clinical outcomes chronic kidney disease and moderately increased albuminuria. Associations of DNA methylation with kidney function, such as CpGs at JAZF1, PELI1 and CHD2 were validated in kidney tissue. Methylation at PHRF1, LDB2, CSRNP1 and IRF5 indicated causal effects on kidney function. Enrichment analyses revealed pathways related to hemostasis and blood cell migration for estimated glomerular filtration rate, and immune cell activation and response for urinary albumin-to-creatinineratio-associated CpGs.},

Autosomal-dominant OPMD is caused by a short (GCG)(8-13) expansions within the first exon of the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 gene (PABPN1), leading to an expanded polyalanine tract in the mutated protein. Expanded PABPN1 forms insoluble aggregates in the nuclei of skeletal muscle fibres. In order to gain insight into the different physiological processes affected in OPMD muscles, we have used a transgenic mouse model of OPMD (A17.1) and performed transcriptomic studies combined with a detailed phenotypic characterization of this model at three time points. The transcriptomic analysis revealed a massive gene deregulation in the A17.1 mice, among which we identified a significant deregulation of pathways associated with muscle atrophy. Using a mathematical model for progression, we have identified that one-third of the progressive genes were also associated with muscle atrophy. Functional and histological analysis of the skeletal muscle of this mouse model confirmed a severe and progressive muscular atrophy associated with a reduction in muscle strength. Moreover, muscle atrophy in the A17.1 mice was restricted to fast glycolytic fibres, containing a large number of intranuclear inclusions (INIs). The soleus muscle and, in particular, oxidative fibres were spared, even though they contained INIs albeit to a lesser degree. These results demonstrate a fibre-type specificity of muscle atrophy in this OPMD model. This study improves our understanding of the biological pathways modified in OPMD to identify potential biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.},

We performed an epigenome-wide association study to identify loci associated with serum C-reactive protein (marker of inflammation) among Ghanaians and further assessed whether differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were linked to CVD in previous reports, or to estimated CVD risk in the same population. We used the Illumina Infinium® HumanMethylation450 BeadChip to obtain DNAm profiles of blood samples in 589 Ghanaians from the RODAM study (without acute infections, not taking anti-inflammatory medications, CRP levels < 40 mg/L). We then used linear models to identify DMPs associated with CRP concentrations. Post-hoc, we evaluated associations of identified DMPs with elevated CVD risk estimated via ASCVD risk score. We also performed subset analyses at CRP levels ≤10 mg/L and replication analyses on candidate probes. Finally, we assessed for biological relevance of our findings in public databases. We subsequently identified 14 novel DMPs associated with CRP. In post-hoc evaluations, we found that DMPs in PC, BTG4 and PADI1 showed trends of associations with estimated CVD risk, we identified a separate DMP in MORC2 that was associated with CRP levels ≤10 mg/L, and we successfully replicated 65 (24%) of previously reported DMPs. All DMPs with gene annotations (13) were biologically linked to inflammation or CVD traits. We have identified epigenetic loci that may play a role in the intersection between inflammation and CVD among Ghanaians. Further studies among other Africans are needed to confirm our findings.},

However, there is, as yet, no structured protocol available for the identification and application of an intervention for stress-related mental health problems at the workplace. This paper describes the structured development, implementation and planning for the evaluation of a return-to-work intervention for sick-listed employees with stress-related mental disorders (SMDs). The intervention is based on an existing successful return-to-work intervention for sick-listed employees with low back pain. The principles of Intervention Mapping were applied to combine theory and evidence in the development, implementation and planning for the evaluation of a participatory workplace intervention, aimed at an early return-to-work for sick-listed employees with SMDs. All stakeholders were involved in focus group interviews: i.e. employees recently sick-listed with SMDs, supervisors and occupational health professionals. The development of the participatory workplace intervention according to the Intervention Mapping principles resulted in a structured return-to-work intervention, specifically tailored to the needs of sick-listed employees with SMDs. Return-to-work was proposed as a behavioural change, and the Attitude - Social influence - self-Efficacy model was identified as a theoretical framework. Stakeholder involvement in focus group interviews served to enhance the implementation. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Intervention Mapping was found to be a promising method to develop interventions tailored to a specific target group in the field of occupational health.},

Under empagliflozin, all GSDIb individuals reported improved quality-of-life-scores. Neutrophil dysfunction related symptoms allowed either granulocyte colony-stimulating factor cessation or tapering. Calculated cost savings per patient per year ranged between € 6482-14 190 (NL) and € 1281-41 231 (AT). The budget impact analysis estimated annual total cost savings ranging between € 75 062-225 716 (NL) and € 37 697-231 790 (AT), based on conservative assumptions. The systematic benefit-risk assessment was favorable. From a VBHC perspective, empagliflozin treatment in GSDIb improved personal and clinical outcomes while saving costs, thereby creating value at multiple pillars. We emphasize the importance to reimburse empagliflozin for GSDIb individuals, further supported by the favorable systematic benefit-risk assessment. These observations in similar directions in two countries/health care systems strongly suggest that our findings can be extrapolated to other geographical areas and health care systems.},

The molecular confirmation of this syndrome is possible in approximately 85% of the cases, whereas in the remaining 15% of the cases, the underlying defect remains unclear. The goal of our research was to identify new epigenetic loci related to BWS. We studied a group of 25 patients clinically diagnosed with BWS but without molecular conformation after DNA diagnostics and performed a whole genome methylation analysis using the HumanMethylation450 Array (Illumina).We found hypermethylation throughout the methylome in two BWS patients. The hypermethylated sites in these patients overlapped and included both non-imprinted and imprinted regions. This finding was not previously described in any BWS-diagnosed patient.Furthermore, one BWS patient exhibited aberrant methylation in four maternally methylated regions-IGF1R, NHP2L1, L3MBTL, and ZDBF2-that overlapped with the differentially methylated regions found in BWS patients with multi-locus imprinting disturbance (MLID). This finding suggests that the BWS phenotype can result from MLID without detectable methylation defects in the primarily disease-associated loci (11p15). Another patient manifested small but significant aberrant methylation in disease-associated loci at 11p near H19, possibly confirming the diagnosis in this patient.},

We studied children from the Dutch EuroPrevall birth cohort study (N = 20 CMA, N = 23 controls, N = 10 tolerant boys), age and gender matched. CMA was challenge proven. Bisulfite converted DNA (blood) was analyzed using the 450K infinium DNA-methylation array. Four groups (combined, girls, boys and tolerant boys) were analysed between CMA and controls. Statistical analysis and pathway-analysis were performed in "R" using IMA, Minfi and the global-test package. Differentially methylated regions in DHX58, ZNF281, EIF42A and HTRA2 genes were validated by quantitative amplicon sequencing (ROCHE 454(®)). General hypermethylation was found in the CMA group compared to control children, while this effect was absent in the tolerant group. Methylation differences were, among others, found in regions of DHX58, ZNF281, EIF42A and HTRA2 genes. Several of these genes are known to be involved in immunological pathways and associated with other allergies. We show that epigenetic associations are involved in CMA. Although, the statistical power of our study is limited and our sample was based on whole blood, we were still able to detect feasible loci and pathways. Therefore our findings might contribute to future diagnostic or therapeutic interventions for specific CMA. Further studies have to confirm the findings of our study.},

  abstract = {Elevated serum urate levels, a complex trait and major risk factor for incident gout, are correlated with cardiometabolic traits via incompletely understood mechanisms. DNA methylation in whole blood captures genetic and environmental influences and is assessed in transethnic meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of serum urate (discovery, n = 12,474, replication, n = 5522). The 100 replicated, epigenome-wide significant (p < 1.1E-7) CpGs explain 11.6% of the serum urate variance. At SLC2A9, the serum urate locus with the largest effect in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), five CpGs are associated with SLC2A9 gene expression. Four CpGs at SLC2A9 have significant causal effects on serum urate levels and/or gout, and two of these partly mediate the effects of urate-associated GWAS variants. In other genes, including SLC7A11 and PHGDH, 17 urate-associated CpGs are associated with conditions defining metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these CpGs may represent a blood DNA methylation signature of cardiometabolic risk factors. This study demonstrates that EWAS can provide new insights into GWAS loci and the correlation of serum urate with other complex traits.},

  abstract = {The choice for a polyadenylation site determines the length of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTRs) of an mRNA. Inclusion or exclusion of regulatory sequences in the 3'-UTR may ultimately affect gene expression levels. Poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) is involved in polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs. An alanine repeat expansion in PABPN1 (exp-PABPN1) causes oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). We hypothesized that previously observed disturbed gene expression patterns in OPMD muscles may have been the result of an effect of PABPN1 on alternative polyadenylation, influencing mRNA stability, localization and translation. A single molecule polyadenylation site sequencing method was developed to explore polyadenylation site usage on a genome-wide level in mice overexpressing exp-PABPN1. We identified 2012 transcripts with altered polyadenylation site usage. In the far majority, more proximal alternative polyadenylation sites were used, resulting in shorter 3'-UTRs. 3'-UTR shortening was generally associated with increased expression. Similar changes in polyadenylation site usage were observed after knockdown or overexpression of expanded but not wild-type PABPN1 in cultured myogenic cells. Our data indicate that PABPN1 is important for polyadenylation site selection and that reduced availability of functional PABPN1 in OPMD muscles results in use of alternative polyadenylation sites, leading to large-scale deregulation of gene expression.},

Several epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) have found DNA methylation loci associated with T2D in European populations. However, data from African populations are lacking. We undertook the first EWAS for T2D among sub-Saharan Africans, aiming at identifying ubiquitous and novel DNA methylation loci associated with T2D. The Illumina 450k DNA-methylation array was used on whole blood samples of 713 Ghanaian participants (256 with T2D, 457 controls) from the cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) for T2D and HbA1c were identified through linear regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, estimated cell counts, hybridization batch, array position and body mass index (BMI). We also did a candidate analysis of previously reported EWAS loci for T2D in non-African populations, identified through a systematic literature search. Four DMPs [cg19693031 (TXNIP), cg04816311 (C7orf50), cg00574958 (CPT1A), cg07988171 (TPM4)] were associated with T2D after correction for inflation by possible systematic biases. The most strongly associated DMP-cg19693031, TXNIP (P = 2.6E-19) -showed hypomethylation in T2D cases compared with controls. Two out of the four DMPs [cg19693031 (TXNIP), cg04816311 (C7orf50)] remained associated with T2D after adjustment for BMI, and one locus [cg07988171 (TPM4)] that has not been reported previously. In this first EWAS for T2D in sub-Saharan Africans, we have identified four DMPs at epigenome-wide level, one of which is novel. These findings provide insight into the epigenetic loci that underlie the burden of T2D in sub-Saharan Africans.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic impacts on marine systems are increasing in frequency, geographic range and severity. While changes in climate will likely lead to the greatest impacts at the system-level, for marine megafauna, entanglement in marine debris also constitutes a pernicious threat. For baleen whales, in regions where high productivity and prolific fisheries overlap, entanglement is emerging as a component of their life history: In some of these regions, entanglement comprises the leading cause of serious injury and mortality. Additionally, up to 80% of whales carry scars indicative of entanglement, and associated declines in long-term health are reducing fecundity. Here, we describe behavioral traits seen in humpback whales during entanglement incidents. Specifically, we focus on reports of humpback whales that have remained in association with entangled whales during these incidents and apply the term "companion whales" in reference to these whales. Reports reviewed include a detailed account of a recent incident observed in Hawaiian waters, a compilation of 62 accounts of similar behavior extracted from 414 reports of entanglement events provided by regional entanglement response networks, and a series of six reports associated with whaling activities. The similarities between the current behavior of companion whales and behaviors observed during whaling activities suggest that this may be an example of behavioral plasticity, underscoring the expanding behavioral repertoire exhibited by baleen whales, and highlighting their potential resilience as they respond to the changing marine environment.},

  abstract = {The Au'au Channel between the islands of Maui and Lanai, Hawaii comprises critical breeding habitat for humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) of the Central North Pacific stock. However, like many regions where marine mega-fauna gather, these waters are also the focus of a flourishing local eco-tourism and whale watching industry. Our aim was to establish current trends in habitat preference in female-calf humpback whale pairs within this region, focusing specifically on the busy, eastern portions of the channel. We used an equally-spaced zigzag transect survey design, compiled our results in a GIS model to identify spatial trends and calculated Neu's Indices to quantify levels of habitat use. Our study revealed that while mysticete female-calf pairs on breeding grounds typically favor shallow, inshore waters, female-calf pairs in the Au'au Channel avoided shallow waters (<20 m) and regions within 2 km of the shoreline. Preferred regions for female-calf pairs comprised water depths between 40-60 m, regions of rugged bottom topography and regions that lay between 4 and 6 km from a small boat harbor (Lahaina Harbor) that fell within the study area. In contrast to other humpback whale breeding grounds, there was only minimal evidence of typical patterns of stratification or segregation according to group composition. A review of habitat use by maternal females across Hawaiian waters indicates that maternal habitat choice varies between localities within the Hawaiian Islands, suggesting that maternal females alter their use of habitat according to locally varying pressures. This ability to respond to varying environments may be the key that allows wildlife species to persist in regions where human activity and critical habitat overlap.},

X-linked and autosomal forms are sometimes clinically indistinguishable. For genetic counseling in families, it is therefore important to know the gene involved. In 24 of 42 unrelated patients with features of HED, we found a mutation in ED1. ED1-negative patients were screened for mutations in EDAR and EDARADD. We found mutations in EDAR in 5 of these 18 patients. One mutation, p.Glu354X, is novel. In EDARADD, a novel variant p.Ser93Phe, probably a neutral polymorphism, was also found. Clinically, there was a difference between autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive HED patients. The phenotype in patients with mutations in both EDAR alleles was comparable to males with X-linked HED. Patients with autosomal dominant HED had features comparable to those of female carriers of X-linked HED. The teeth of these patients were quite severely affected. Hypohidrosis and sparse hair were also evident, but less severe. This study confirms Chassaing et al's earlier finding that mutations in EDAR account for approximately 25% of non-ED1-related HED. Mutations leading to a premature stop codon have a recessive effect except when the stop codon is in the last exon. Heterozygous missense mutations in the functional domains of the gene may have a dominant-negative effect with much variation in expression. Patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the EDAR gene have a more severe phenotype than those with a heterozygous missense, nonsense or frame-shift mutation.},

It is not clear, whether infants with CMA have an increased risk of developing other allergic diseases later in life, the so-called "allergic march". We aimed to detect genetic associations of CMA using reported single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in other allergic diseases and genetic mutations within the filaggrin (FLG) gene. Both to investigate possible causes of CMA, which also suggests an "allergic march". Thirty children from the Dutch EuroPrevall birth cohort study with CMA in infancy and twenty-three healthy controls were studied. Six candidate SNPs were selected (minor allele frequency 10-50 % combined with a large effect) based on the literature. Thirteen FLG candidate mutations were selected spread over repeats 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10 respectively. We found two SNP's, rs17616434 (P = 0.002) and rs2069772 (P = 0.038), significantly associated with CMA. One is located near the toll like receptor 6 (TLR6) gene, which functionally interacts with toll-like receptor 2, and is associated with an increased risk of other allergic diseases. One is located at the Interleukin 2 (IL2) locus. Twelve FLG amplicons were analyzed, but showed no significant enrichment. Nevertheless, we did observe more FLG mutations in the CMA-group compared to controls. We significantly associated two SNPs with CMA, suggesting that variation in the TLR6 and IL2 genes contribute to the expression of CMA. In addition, since TLR6 and IL2 were earlier associated with other later onset allergies, this also favours the "allergic march" hypothesis. We observed more FLG mutations in the CMA-group, albeit we found no statistical significant enrichment of FLG mutations. Further studies are necessary to investigate the role of common variants and FLG or other skin barrier gene mutations in CMA.},

The parameters affecting enantioselectivity (column efficiency, influence of modifiers and basic or acidic additives, and temperature) have been studied. Enantiomerization of 3-OH-benzodiazepines could be suppressed by working at low temperatures or by using acetonitrile as a comodifier. Serial coupling of different chiral stationary phase columns resulted in a column triplet (Chiralpak AD, an amylose derivative; Chiralcel OD, a cellulose derivative; and Chirex 3022, a Brush-type with pi-donor characteristics) on which all solutes investigated could be baseline separated.},

Sixty CPR sessions (140s each, 30:2, C:R ratio 1:1) were performed using a manikin on standard hospital mattresses, with or without a backboard in combination with variable weights. Sternum-to-spine compression distance was controlled (range 30-60mm) allowing evaluation of the underlying compliant surface on total hand travel. Movement of the caregiver's hands was significantly larger (up to 111mm at 50mm compression depth, p<0.0001) when sternum-to-spine compressions were performed without a backboard than with one. The extent of this variable extra travel effect depended on the type of mattress as well as the force of compression. Foam mattresses and air chamber systems act as springs and follow hand movement, while 'slow foam' mattresses incorporate time delays, making depth and force sensing harder. A backboard decreases the extra hand movement due to mattress effects by more than 50%, strongly reducing caregiver work. Total vertical hand movement is significantly, and clinically relevantly much, larger than sternum-to-spine compression depth when CPR is performed on a mattress. Additional movement depends on the type of mattress and can be strongly reduced, but not eliminated, when a backboard is applied. The additional motion and increased work load adds extra complexity to in-hospital CPR. We propose that this should be taken into account during training by in-hospital caregivers.},

We hypothesized that skin temperature in a specific limb could be disrupted by psychologically disrupting the sense of ownership of that limb. In six separate experiments, and by using an established protocol to induce the rubber hand illusion, we demonstrate that skin temperature of the real hand decreases when we take ownership of an artificial counterpart. The decrease in skin temperature is limb-specific: it does not occur in the unstimulated hand, nor in the ipsilateral foot. The effect is not evoked by tactile or visual input per se, nor by simultaneous tactile and visual input per se, nor by a shift in attention toward the experimental side or limb. In fact, taking ownership of an artificial hand slows tactile processing of information from the real hand, which is also observed in patients who demonstrate body disownership after stroke. These findings of psychologically induced limb-specific disruption of temperature regulation provide the first evidence that: taking ownership of an artificial body part has consequences for the real body part; that the awareness of our physical self and the physiological regulation of self are closely linked in a top-down manner; and that cognitive processes that disrupt the sense of body ownership may in turn disrupt temperature regulation in numerous states characterized by both.},

  abstract = {A series of modifiable lifestyle factors, such as diet quality, physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking, may drive the rising burden of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) among sub-Saharan Africans globally. It is unclear whether epigenetic changes play a mediatory role in the associations between these lifestyle factors and T2DM. We assessed the associations between a comprehensive lifestyle index, DNA methylation and T2DM among Ghanaian adults. We used whole-blood Illumina 450 k DNA methylation data from 713 Ghanaians from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. We constructed a comprehensive lifestyle index based on established cut-offs for diet quality, physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking status. In the T2DM-free discovery cohort (n = 457), linear models were fitted to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with the lifestyle index after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and technical covariates. Associations between the identified DMPs and the primary outcome (T2DM), as well as secondary outcomes (fasting blood glucose (FBG) and HbA1c), were determined via logistic and linear regression models, respectively. In the present study population (mean age: 52 ± 10 years; male: 42.6%), the comprehensive lifestyle index showed a significant association with one DMP annotated to an intergenic region on chromosome 7 (false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.024). Others were annotated to ADCY7, SMARCE1, AHRR, LOXL2, and PTBP1 genes. One DMR was identified and annotated to the GFPT2 gene (familywise error rate (FWER) from bumphunter bootstrap = 0.036). None of the DMPs showed significant associations with T2DM; directions of effect were positive for the DMP in the AHRR and inverse for all the other DMPs. Higher methylation of the ADCY7 DMP was associated with higher FBG (p = 0.024); LOXL2 DMP was associated with lower FBG (p = 0.023) and HbA1c (p = 0.049); and PTBP1 DMP was associated with lower HbA1c (p = 0.002). In this explorative epigenome-wide association study among Ghanaians, we identified one DMP and DMR associated with a comprehensive lifestyle index not previously associated with individual lifestyle factors. Based on our findings, we infer that lifestyle factors in combination, affect DNA methylation, thereby influencing the risk of T2DM among Ghanaian adults living in different contexts.},

  abstract = {Closure of the ductus arteriosus (DA) at birth is essential for the transition from fetal to postnatal life. Before birth the DA bypasses the uninflated lungs by shunting blood from the pulmonary trunk into the systemic circulation. The molecular mechanism underlying DA closure and degeneration has not been fully elucidated, but is associated with apoptosis and cytolytic necrosis in the inner media and intima. We detected features of histology during DA degeneration that are comparable to Hutchinson Gilford Progeria syndrome and ageing. Immunohistochemistry on human fetal and neonatal DA, and aorta showed that lamin A/C was expressed in all layers of the vessel wall. As a novel finding we report that progerin, a splicing variant of lamin A/C was expressed almost selectively in the normal closing neonatal DA, from which we hypothesized that progerin is involved in DA closure. Progerin was detected in 16.2%±7.2 cells of the DA. Progerin-expressing cells were predominantly located in intima and inner media where cytolytic necrosis accompanied by apoptosis will develop. Concomitantly we found loss of α-smooth muscle actin as well as reduced lamin A/C expression compared to the fetal and non-closing DA. In cells of the adjacent aorta, that remains patent, progerin expression was only sporadically detected in 2.5%±1.5 of the cells. Data were substantiated by the detection of mRNA of progerin in the neonatal DA but not in the aorta, by PCR and sequencing analysis. The fetal DA and the non-closing persistent DA did not present with progerin expressing cells. Our analysis revealed that the spatiotemporal expression of lamin A/C and progerin in the neonatal DA was mutually exclusive. We suggest that activation of LMNA alternative splicing is involved in vascular remodeling in the circulatory system during normal neonatal DA closure.},

The effect of such a stressor on health could potentially be mediated via epigenetics. In this study we performed an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to assess the association between levels of PD with genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in SSA migrants. The Illumina 450 K DNA-methylation array was used on whole blood samples of 340 Ghanaian adults residing in three European cities from the cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study. PD was assessed using sum scores of the Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS). Differentially methylated positions and regions (DMPs and DMRs) were identified through linear regression analysis. Two hypo-methylated DMPs, namely cg13986138 (CYFIP1) and cg10316525(ANKRD63), were found to be associated with PD. DMR analysis identified 47 regions associated with the PD. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first EWAS for PD in first generation SSA migrants. We identified two DMPs associated with PD. Whether these associations underlie a consequence or causal effect within the scope of biological functionality needs additional research.},

We aimed to assess whether altered DNA methylation might be associated with FH in this latter group. In this study we included 78 FH mutation-negative patients and 58 FH mutation-positive patients with a pathogenic LDLR variant. All patients were male, not using lipid lowering therapies and had LDL-C levels >6 mmol/L and triglyceride levels <3.5 mmol/L. DNA methylation was measured with the Infinium Methylation EPIC 850 K beadchip assay. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to explore DNA methylation differences between the two groups in genes related to lipid metabolism. A gradient boosting machine learning model was applied to investigate accumulated genome-wide differences between the two groups. Candidate gene analysis revealed one significantly hypomethylated CpG site in CPT1A (cg00574958) in FH mutation-negative patients, while no differences in methylation in other lipid genes were observed. The machine learning model did distinguish the two groups with a mean Area Under the Curve (AUC)±SD of 0.80±0.17 and provided two CpG sites (cg26426080 and cg11478607) in genes with a possible link to lipid metabolism (PRDM16 and GSTT1). FH mutation-negative patients are characterized by accumulated genome wide DNA methylation differences, but not by major DNA methylation alterations in known lipid genes compared to FH mutation-positive patients.

We investigated the potential of photoplethysmography (PPG) to detect the presence of a spontaneous pulse during automated CPR in an animal study. Twelve anesthetized pigs were instrumented to monitor circulatory and respiratory parameters. Here we present the simultaneously recorded PPG and arterial blood pressure (ABP) signals. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, followed by 20 min of automated CPR and subsequent defibrillation. After defibrillation, pediatric-guidelines-style life support was given in cycles of 2 min. PPG and ABP waveforms were recorded during all stages of the protocol. Raw PPG waveforms were acquired with a custom-built photoplethysmograph controlling a commercial reflectance pulse oximetry probe attached to the nose. ABP was measured in the aorta. In nine animals ROSC was achieved. Throughout the protocol, PPG and ABP frequency content showed strong resemblance. We demonstrate that (1) the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse during ventilation pauses, and that (2) frequency analysis of the PPG waveform allows for the detection of a spontaneous pulse and the determination of the pulse rate, even during ongoing chest compressions, if the pulse and compression rates are sufficiently distinct. These results demonstrate the potential of PPG as a non-invasive means to detect pulse presence or absence, as well as pulse rate during CPR.},

  abstract = {Muscle fibrosis characterizes degenerated muscles in muscular dystrophies and in late onset myopathies. Fibrotic muscles often exhibit thickening of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The molecular regulation of this process is not fully understood. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), an expansion of an alanine tract at the N-terminus of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) causes muscle symptoms. OPMD patient muscle degeneration initiates after midlife, while at an earlier age carriers of alanine expansion mutant PABPN1 (expPABPN1) are clinically pre-symptomatic. OPMD is characterized by fibrosis in skeletal muscles but the causative molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. We studied the molecular processes that are involved in OPMD pathology using cross-species mRNA expression profiles in muscles from patients and model systems. We identified significant dysregulation of the ECM functional group, among which the procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 1 gene (PCOLCE) was consistently down-regulated across species. We investigated PCOLCE subcellular localization in OPMD muscle samples and OPMD model systems to investigate any functional relevance of PCOLCE down-regulation in this disease. We found that muscle degeneration in OPMD is associated with PCOLCE down-regulation. In addition to its known presence at the ECM, we also found PCOLCE within the nucleus of muscle cells. PCOLCE sub-cellular localization changes during myoblast cell fusion and is disrupted in cells expressing mutant expPABPN1. Our results show that PCOLCE binds to soluble PABPN1 and co-localizes with aggregated PABPN1 with a preference for the mutant protein. In muscle biopsies from OPMD patients we find that extracellular PCOLCE is depleted with its concomitant enrichment within the nuclear compartment. PCOLCE regulates collagen processing at the ECM. Depletion of extracellular PCOLCE is associated with the expression of expPABPN1 in OPMD patient muscles. PCOLCE is also localized within the nucleus where it binds to PABPN1, suggesting that PCOLCE shuttles between the ECM and the nucleus. PCOLCE preferentially binds to expPABPN1. Nuclear-localized PCOLCE is enriched in muscle cells expressing expPABPN1. We suggest that nuclear entrapment of PCOLCE and its extracellular depletion represents a novel molecular mechanism in late-onset muscle fibrosis.},

Such factors may partially affect these traits through epigenetic programing.

DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most commonly studied epigenetic feature. In this study we conducted an epigenome-wide DNAm association analysis on height-related traits in a Sub-Saharan African population, in order to detect DNAm biomarkers across four height-related traits. DNAm profiles were acquired in whole blood samples of 704 Ghanaians, sourced from the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants study, using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Linear models were fitted to detect differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) associated with height, leg-to-height ratio (LHR), leg length, and sitting height. No epigenome-wide significant DMPs were recorded. However we did observe among our top DMPs five informative probes associated with the height-related traits: cg26905768 (leg length), cg13268132 (leg length), cg19776793 (height), cg23072383 (LHR), and cg24625894 (sitting height).

Blood flow is rarely measured systematically with high fidelity. Using a programmable mechanical chest compression device, we studied the effect of inter-compression pauses in a swine model of cardiac arrest, testing the hypothesis that a single 'optimal' CC waveform exists based on measurements of resulting blood flow. Hemodynamics were studied in 9 domestic swine (∼30 kg) using multiple flow probes and standard physiological monitoring. After 10 min of ventricular fibrillation, five mechanical chest compression waveforms (5.1 cm, varying inter-compression pauses) were delivered for 2 min each in a semi-random pattern, totaling 50 compression minutes. Linear Mixed Models were used to estimate the effect of compression waveform on hemodynamics. Blood flow and pressure decayed significantly with time in both arteries and veins. No waveform maximized blood flow in all vessels simultaneously and the waveform generating maximal blood flow in a specific vessel changed over time in all vessels. A flow mismatch between paired arteries and veins, e.g. abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, also developed over time. The waveform with the slowest rate and shortest duty cycle had the smallest mismatch between flows after about 30 min of CPR. This data challenges the concept of a single optimal CC waveform. Time dependent physiological response to compressions and no single compression waveform optimizing flow in all vessels indicate that current descriptions of CPR don't reflect patient physiology.},

To model OPMD in a myogenic and physiological context, we generated mouse myoblast cell clones stably expressing either human wild type (WT) or expPABPN1 at low levels. Transgene expression is induced on myotube differentiation and results in formation of insoluble nuclear PABPN1 aggregates that are similar to those observed in patients with OPMD. Quantitative analysis of PABPN1 in myotube cultures revealed that expPABPN1 accumulation and aggregation is greater than that of the WT protein. We found that aggregation of expPABPN1 is more affected than WT PABPN1 by inhibition of proteasome activity. Consistent with this, in myotube cultures expressing expPABPN1, deregulation of the proteasome was identified as the most significantly perturbed pathway. Differences in the accumulation of soluble WT and expPABPN1 were consistent with differences in ubiquitination and rate of protein turnover. This study demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, that, in myotubes, the ratio of soluble/insoluble expPABPN1 is significantly lower compared with that of the WT protein. We suggest that this difference can contribute to muscle weakness in OPMD.},

We found significant methylome-wide associations for pediatric PTSD (false discovery rate p < .05) compared with non-PTSD control groups (traumatized and nontraumatized youths). Methylation differences on nine genes were replicated, including genes related to glucocorticoid functioning. In both cohorts, methylation on OLFM3 gene was further associated with anterior hippocampal volume. These findings point to molecular pathways involved in inflammation, stress response, and neuroplasticity as potential contributors to neural abnormalities and provide potentially unique biomarkers and treatment targets for pediatric PTSD.},

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAm) have previously been linked to PTSD pathogenesis, additionally DNAm may affect response to (psychological) therapies. Besides investigating the direct link between DNAm and treatment response, it might be helpful to investigate the link between DNAm and previously associated biological mechanisms with treatment outcome. Thereby gaining a deeper molecular understanding of how psychotherapy (reflecting a change in the environment) relates to epigenetic changes and the adaptability of individuals. To date, limited research is done in clinical samples and no studies have been conducted in youth. Therefore we conducted a study in a Dutch cohort of youth with and without PTSD (n = 87, age 8-18 years). We examined the cross-sectional and longitudinal changes of saliva-based genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) levels, and salivary cortisol secretion. The last might reflect possible abbreviations on the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA-axis is previously linked to DNAm and the development and recovery of PTSD. Youth were treated with 8 sessions of either Eye Movement Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR) or Trauma Focused Cognitive behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). Our epigenome wide approach showed distinct methylation between treatment responders and non-responders on C18orf63 gene post-treatment. This genomic region is related to the PAX5 gene, involved in neurodevelopment and inflammation response. Additionally, our targeted approach indicated that there were longitudinal DNAm changes in successfully treated youth at the CRHR2 gene. Methylation at this gene was further correlated with cortisol secretion pre- and post-treatment. Awaiting replication, findings of this first study in youth point to molecular pathways involved in stress response and neuroplasticity to be associated with treatment response.},

Prospective CGM data were collected during the ENGLUPRO GSDIa trial (NCT04311307) in which a Dexcom G6 device was used. Ten adult patients with GSDIa and 10 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled.

Descriptive [eg, glycemic variability (GV), time below range, time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR)] and advanced (ie, first- and second-order derivatives, Fourier analysis) CGM outcomes were calculated. For each descriptive CGM outcome measure, 95% CIs were computed in patients with GSDIa and healthy volunteers, respectively. CGM overestimation was higher under preprandial and level 1 hypoglycemia (ie, capillary glucose values ≥ 3.0 mmol/L and < 3.9 mmol/L) conditions. GV and TAR were higher while TIR was lower in patients with GSDIa compared to healthy volunteers (P < 0.05).

Advanced CGM analysis revealed a distinct pattern (ie, first- and second-order derivatives and glucose curve amplitude) in each of these 3 patients within the patients group. This is the first study to prospectively compare CGM outcomes between adult patients with GSDIa and matched healthy volunteers.

Since in vitro propagation can lead to (epi-)genetic mutations and possibly malignant transformation of the starting cell population, we set out to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation status in uncultured and cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ sorted cells and compare them with germ cell tumor samples of the seminoma subtype. Seminomas displayed a severely global hypomethylated profile, including loss of genomic imprinting, which we did not detect in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells. Differential methylation analysis revealed altered regulation of gamete formation and meiotic processes in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells but not in seminomas. The pivotal POU5F1 marker was hypomethylated in seminomas but not in uncultured or cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells, which is reflected in the POU5F1 mRNA expression levels. Lastly, seminomas displayed a number of characteristic copy number variations that were not detectable in primary testicular ITGA6+ cells, either before or after culture. Together, the data show a distinct DNA methylation patterns in cultured primary testicular ITGA6+ cells that does not resemble the pattern found in seminomas, but also highlight the need for more sensitive methods to fully exclude the presence of malignant cells after culture and to further study the epigenetic events that take place during in vitro culture.},

Here, we identify a specific hypermethylation signature associated with loss of function mutations in the SETD1B gene which may be used as an epigenetic marker supporting the diagnosis of syndromic SETD1B-related diseases.

The aim of this study was to identify DNA-methylation loci associated with plasma lipids in Ghanaians. We conducted an EWAS using Illumina 450k DNA-methylation array profiles of extracted DNA from 663 Ghanaian participants. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were examined for association with plasma total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and technical covariates. Findings were replicated in independent cohorts of different ethnicities. We identified one significantly associated DMP with triglycerides (cg19693031 annotated to TXNIP, regression coefficient beta -0.26, false discovery rate adjusted p-value 0.001), which replicated in-silico in South African Batswana, African American, and European populations. From the top five DMPs with the lowest nominal p-values, two additional DMPs for triglycerides (CPT1A, ABCG1), two DMPs for LDL-cholesterol (EPSTI1, cg13781819), and one for TC (TXNIP) replicated. With the exception of EPSTI1, these loci are involved in lipid transport/metabolism or are known GWAS-associated loci. The top 5 DMPs per lipid trait explained 9.5% in the variance of TC, 8.3% in LDL-cholesterol, 6.1% in HDL-cholesterol, and 11.0% in triglycerides. The top DMPs identified in this study are in loci that play a role in lipid metabolism across populations, including West-Africans. Future studies including larger sample size, longitudinal study design and translational research is needed to increase our understanding on the epigenetic regulation of lipid metabolism among West-African populations.

The derivation of gene regulatory networks from high-throughput expression data via machine learning strategies is problematic as the reliability of these models is often compromised by limited and highly variable samples, heterogeneity in transcript isoforms, noise, and other artifacts. Here, we develop a novel algorithm, dubbed Dandelion, in which we construct and train intraspecies Bayesian networks that are translated and assessed on independent test sets from other species in a reiterative procedure. The interspecies disease networks are subjected to multi-layers of analysis and evaluation, leading to the identification of the most consistent relationships within the network structure. In this study, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on datasets from animal models of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and patient materials. We show that the interspecies network of genes coding for the proteasome provide highly accurate predictions on gene expression levels and disease phenotype. Moreover, the cross-species translation increases the stability and robustness of these networks. Unlike existing modeling approaches, our algorithms do not require assumptions on notoriously difficult one-to-one mapping of protein orthologues or alternative transcripts and can deal with missing data. We show that the identified key components of the OPMD disease network can be confirmed in an unseen and independent disease model. This study presents a state-of-the-art strategy in constructing interspecies disease networks that provide crucial information on regulatory relationships among genes, leading to better understanding of the disease molecular mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Surgery for refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and hiatal hernia leads to recurrence or persisting dysphagia in a minority of patients. Redo antireflux surgery in GERD and hiatal hernia is known for higher morbidity and mortality. This study aims to evaluate conventional versus robot-assisted laparoscopic redo antireflux surgery, with the objective to detect possible advantages for the robot-assisted approach. A single institute cohort of 75 patients who underwent either conventional laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic redo surgery for recurrent GERD or severe dysphagia between 2008 and 2013 were included in the study. Baseline characteristics, symptoms, medical history, procedural data, hospital stay, complications and outcome were prospectively gathered. The main indications for redo surgery were dysphagia, pyrosis or a combination of both in combination with a proven anatomic abnormality. The mean time to redo surgery was 1.9 and 2.0 years after primary surgery for the conventional and robot-assisted groups, respectively. The number of conversions was lower in the robot-assisted group compared to conventional laparoscopy (1/45 vs. 5/30, p = 0.035) despite a higher proportion of patients with previous surgery by laparotomy (9/45 vs. 1/30, p = 0.038). Median hospital stay was reduced by 1 day (3 vs. 4, p = 0.042). There were no differences in mortality, complications or outcome. Robotic support, when available, can be regarded beneficial in redo surgery for GERD and hiatal hernia. Results of this observational study suggest technical feasibility for minimal-invasive robot-assisted redo surgery after open primary antireflux surgery, a reduced number of conversions and shorter hospital stay.},

This study aimed to provide information on the morbidity and mortality of robot-assisted complex hiatal hernia repair and redo anti-reflux surgery in a high-volume center. All patients that underwent robot-assisted hiatal hernia repair, redo hiatal hernia repair, and anti-reflux surgery between 2011 and 2017 at the Meander Medical Centre, Amersfoort, the Netherlands were evaluated. Primary endpoints were 30-day morbidity and mortality. Major complications were defined as Clavien-Dindo ≥ IIIb. Primary surgery 211 primary surgeries were performed by two surgeons. The median age was 67 (IQR 58-73) years. 84.4% of patients had a type III or IV hernia (10.9% Type I; 1.4% Type II; 45.5% Type III; 38.9% Type IV, 1.4% no herniation). In 3.3% of procedures, conversion was required. 17.1% of patients experienced complications. The incidence of major complications was 5.2%. Ten patients (4.7%) were readmitted within 30 days. Symptomatic early recurrence occurred in two patients (0.9%). The 30-day mortality was 0.9%. Redo surgery 151 redo procedures were performed by two surgeons. The median age was 60 (IQR 51-68) years. In 2.0%, the procedure was converted. The overall incidence of complications was 10.6%, while the incidence of major complications was 2.6%. Three patients (2.0%) were readmitted within 30 days. One patient (0.7%) experienced symptomatic early recurrence. No patients died in the 30-day postoperative period. This study provides valuable information on robot-assisted laparoscopic repair of primary or recurrent hiatal hernia and anti-reflux surgery for both patient and surgeon. Serious morbidity of 5.2% in primary surgery and 2.6% in redo surgery, in this large series with a high surgeon caseload, has to be outweighed by the gain in quality of life or relief of serious medical implications of hiatal hernia when counseling for surgical intervention.},

We report here the long-term results of modified Belsey fundoplication (Gastroesophageal Valvuloplasty; GEV) performed laparoscopically using a surgical robot. Patients who underwent robotic GEV were reviewed retrospectively. Operations were performed by laparoscopy and included robotic dissection of the esophageal hiatus, primary closure of the hiatus, followed by intussusception of a 4 cm segment of the esophagus into the stomach for 270°, and suspension of the fundoplication on the hiatal closure. The results were assessed by postoperative endoscopy, contrast esophagography, a Subjective Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ), and objective Visick grading. There were 291 patients (156 male, 135 female, mean age 51±14 years). Indications were intractability (73%) and pulmonary symptoms (27%). Mean operative time was 130 minutes ± 52 minutes. Minor complications were seen in 21%. There was no mortality. Mean hospitalization was 2.8 days ± 1.7 days. Mean follow-up was 85 months ± 7 months. During this period, the mean SSQ score decreased from 8.3 ± 0.6 to 0.7± 0.2 (P < 0.05). There was no long-term dysphasia or gas bloat. Ninety-five percent of patients were Visick I and 5% were Visick II. Hiatal hernia recurred in 7 patients (2%). Robotic laparoscopic modified Belsey fundoplication (GEV) is associated with excellent long-term durability, reflux control, and low rates of dysphasia and gas bloat. This procedure may represent an alternative to medical antireflux therapy and other surgical antireflux procedures such as Nissen fundoplication.},

Preoperative anaemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In general practice, little attention is paid to these anaemic patients. Some will have oral iron prescribed others not. The waiting period prior to elective colorectal surgery could be used to optimize a patients' physiological status. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of preoperative intravenous iron supplementation in comparison with the standard preoperative oral supplementation in anaemic patients with colorectal cancer. In this multicentre randomized controlled trial, patients with an M0-staged colorectal carcinoma who are scheduled for curative resection and with a proven iron deficiency anaemia are eligible for inclusion. Main exclusion criteria are palliative surgery, metastatic disease, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (5 × 5 Gy = no exclusion) and the use of Recombinant Human Erythropoietin within three months before inclusion or a blood transfusion within a month before inclusion. Primary endpoint is the percentage of patients that achieve normalisation of the haemoglobin level between the start of the treatment and the day of admission for surgery. This study is a superiority trial, hypothesizing a greater proportion of patients achieving the primary endpoint in favour of iron infusion compared to oral supplementation. A total of 198 patients will be randomized to either ferric(III)carboxymaltose infusion in the intervention arm or ferrofumarate in the control arm. This study will be performed in ten centres nationwide and one centre in Ireland. This is the first randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of preoperative iron supplementation in exclusively anaemic patients with a colorectal carcinoma. Our trial hypotheses a more profound haemoglobin increase with intravenous iron which may contribute to a superior optimisation of the patient's condition and possibly a decrease in postoperative morbidity.

Moreover, there is no clear standardisation of best practice in the current European landscape, which could result in inconsistencies in regional anaesthesia in practice. The objective of this survey was to explore regional anaesthesia practices across Europe, including the differences in procedures, use of ultrasound, reporting of complications, guidelines, training and patient safety implementation. A Faculty of European regional anaesthesia experts developed a survey of 27 questions focused on respondent and institution profile, anaesthesia services, patient and safety management, training, use of guidelines, and the implementation of NRFit The survey was disseminated across several European countries via professional networks. There were 794 respondents from 36 European countries. The survey demonstrated that use of regional anaesthesia is growing in Europe and is supported by new technologies. Although some results are consistent with expected trends and applications (e.g. procedures predominantly performed by anaesthesiologists), there are inconsistencies in practice across European countries, especially in the specific regional anaesthesia procedures utilised for different clinical applications and the recording and reporting of regional anaesthesia complications. These inconsistencies also extended to which guidelines are primarily followed and how training is implemented. There were also variations in the general awareness and uptake of the ISO standard for NRFit. The survey results highlight a clear need for standardisation and consistency in the use and management of regional anaesthesia across Europe. The faculty put forth several calls to action that could provide major steps in the right direction towards meeting that goal, including the establishment of European best practices, development of a complication reporting system and implementation of educational programmes to highlight the importance of NRFit.},

Prospective, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. Closed-format 22-bed mixed intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients > or =18 yrs with sepsis, according to international criteria, and at least one early sign of organ dysfunction, as the principal reason for intensive care unit admission, were eligible for enrollment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive nitroglycerin (n = 35) or placebo (n = 35) after fulfillment of protocol-driven resuscitation end points. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00493415. Primary outcome was sublingual microcirculatory blood flow of small vessels, as assessed by side-stream dark field imaging. After protocolized resuscitation, we observed recruitment of sublingual microcirculation in both groups, as indicated by a significant improvement in the microcirculatory flow index after 24 hrs, in comparison to baseline. However, no difference in the sublingual microvascular flow index was observed between groups. The median microvascular flow index in sublingual small-sized vessels was 2.71 (1.85-3) in the nitroglycerin group and 2.71 (1.27-3), p = .80, in the placebo group. In medium-sized vessels, the respective values were 3 (2.75-3) vs. 2.86 (2.19-3), p = .21, and in large-sized vessels, 3 (3-3) vs. 3 (2.89-3), p = .06. In-hospital mortality, as a secondary outcome, was 34.3% in the nitroglycerin group and 14.2% in the placebo group, p = .09. In the context of a strict resuscitation protocol, based upon fulfillment of systemic hemodynamic end points in patients with early-phase severe sepsis or septic shock, we conclude that intravenous nitroglycerin does not promote sublingual microcirculatory blood flow.},
