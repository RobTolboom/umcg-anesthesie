Rob completed his medical studies at Utrecht University, where his internships in surgery and pediatric anesthesiology sparked an interest in research. After obtaining his medical degree in 2012, he joined Meander Medical Center in Amersfoort as a surgical resident. There, he contributed to improving care for hiatal hernia patients and conducted research on robotic hiatal hernia surgery. His engagement in research led to writing a thesis on robotic surgery for hiatal hernia.

He has recently finished his anesthesiology residency at Radboud University Medical Center and has taken a course on AI for Health to better understand the role of technology in medicine. As part of the AI for Anesthesiology research group, he is exploring how AI can support anesthesiology, aiming to contribute to the field through collaboration and innovation.

He is currently working as anesthesiologist at University Medical Center Groningen.
