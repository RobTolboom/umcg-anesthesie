I’m anesthesiologist and a new PhD student at the Anesthesiology Department. My first PhD was done in Brazil at University of São Paulo. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are a mayor concert for the patients after surgery. My research focus on medications for postoperative nausea and vomiting. Despite several guidelines, there is still much to be discovered to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting after surgery, because even with the recommended guidelines, the incidence remains high in certain population groups.
